## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know what type of medicine journey you're preparing for and where you're having it. Without that context, I can't give you the proper opening.

Are you working with ayahuasca, psilocybin, or another medicine? And are you at a specific retreat center or location?

Once I have those details, I'll give you the full opening and we can start building your three intentions.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I'm working with psilocybin—it's a legal retreat in Oregon, so licensed facilitators and everything. Six weeks from now, two-day retreat. 

25mg dose, which from the research I've seen is moderate-high for therapeutic work. Johns Hopkins has been using similar dosing in their depression studies. I picked psilocybin because the data's solid and I didn't want to deal with ayahuasca's dietary restrictions or the whole purging thing. 

Actually, I should mention—I've never done any psychedelics before. Zero personal experience despite following the research for years. I know the neuroscience backward and forward but I'm completely in the dark about what actually happens when you can't "therapist" your way through an experience. Which is probably the whole point, honestly.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your psilocybin journey in Oregon.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For psilocybin, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey after years of following the research?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: What brought me here? That's... God, that's actually a hard question to answer without analyzing why it's hard to answer.

I was at this psychedelic therapy conference in Denver two months ago—sitting in on a panel about clinician self-care, and this therapist shared how she'd been helping clients heal for years but couldn't access her own healing until she did her own medicine journey. And I felt something crack open. Not like an insight—I can analyze insights to death—but this recognition that I've been living this half-life where I'm excellent at helping others feel their feelings while I'm professionally competent and personally... empty? Stuck?

I've been in therapy for 27 years. I've done IFS, EMDR, somatic work, every modality. I can name every defense mechanism I'm using while I'm using it. And nothing has fundamentally changed—I still intellectualize everything, still feel profoundly alone, still can't seem to *feel* instead of analyze.

So I booked the retreat. Because I'm terrified that I'm too defended for psychedelics to work on me, and maybe even more terrified that they *will* work and I'll have to feel everything I've been avoiding for decades. 

I mean, I know that's probably the answer to your question, but I'm already intellectualizing it instead of just saying—what? That I'm desperate? That I'm hoping this will work where everything else hasn't?


**intentions_workflow_3**: 27 years of therapy, every modality, and you're still watching yourself from the outside - analyzing the analysis while the loneliness stays put.

That crack in Denver sounds like it showed you something your intellect couldn't reach. The terror you mention - that you're too defended OR that it'll actually work - that's the real edge.

What are you hoping to heal, understand, or discover when your usual tools aren't available?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I think... God, I don't know how to talk about this without immediately analyzing what I'm about to say, but—

I want to understand what it feels like to actually *be* in my body instead of observing it from the ceiling. I've been living in my head for so long—tracking my nervous system, naming my attachment patterns, observing my somatic responses like I'm writing a case report on myself. I want to know what it's like to feel something without immediately categorizing it or turning it into a therapeutic intervention.

There's this grief I've been carrying about my marriage ending eight years ago that I've completely intellectualized. I can talk about attachment wounds and complex trauma and conscious uncoupling, but I've never actually *felt* the loss. I'm scared it's calcified inside me—like I've built this entire competent therapist identity around avoiding that pain, and now I can't access it even if I wanted to.

And underneath all of it, this bone-deep loneliness that I've normalized. I help people heal their attachment wounds while I'm... what? Too defended to let anyone actually matter? Too afraid that if someone really saw me—past all the competence and frameworks—there'd be nothing there?

I want to discover if there's something underneath all this analyzing. If I stopped performing being healed and actually let myself be a mess for once, would there be anything real underneath? Or have I just become my defenses?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three threads emerging:

1. Being in your body instead of observing it from the ceiling - actually feeling instead of categorizing
2. Accessing the grief about your marriage that's calcified under all that competence 
3. Finding what's real underneath the performance - if there's something beyond the defenses and frameworks

That loneliness you mention - helping others heal attachment wounds while being too defended to let anyone matter - that's the deeper layer.

When you imagine actually feeling that grief about your marriage ending, what would be different in your daily life if that pain moved through you instead of staying locked up?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: If I actually let myself feel that grief... I think I'd stop pretending I'm "fine alone" and admit that I'm starving for connection. That this whole narrative I've constructed about being commitment-phobic since the divorce is just armor—protecting me from risking loss again. 

Maybe I'd stop performing competence with my friends and actually let them see how lonely I am. Sarah keeps asking about my dating life and I keep giving her this analytical answer about attachment patterns when what I really want to say is "I'm terrified no one will want the real me if I stop being useful and impressive for five minutes."

I might actually pick up the phone when my mom calls instead of letting it go to voicemail because I'm tired of her worrying about me being alone—but also tired of pretending her concern doesn't touch the part of me that's scared she's right.

And maybe—this sounds so small but feels enormous—maybe I'd stop researching relationship books and actually let myself want something I can't intellectualize my way into. I'd stop analyzing why I can't seem to "manifest partnership" and just... admit I miss being known by someone. That I miss David sometimes, not because we were perfect but because he saw me before I became this professionally-healed version of myself.

I think feeling that grief would mean I have to stop being the therapist who has it all figured out and just be a 46-year-old woman who's heartbroken and scared and wants to be held but doesn't know how to ask anymore.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You'd trade the "commitment-phobic" narrative for the truth - you're starving for connection but terrified no one wants the real you underneath the competence.

You'd stop performing for friends and actually tell Sarah you're terrified of being unwanted if you stop being impressive for five minutes.

You'd admit you miss David because he saw you before you became this professionally-healed version of yourself.

Three intentions based on these threads:

1. I welcome feeling my grief fully so I can stop pretending I'm fine alone
2. I open to showing my real loneliness instead of performing competence with friends
3. I embrace being a woman who wants connection without needing to intellectualize or impress

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: The third one—"I embrace being a woman who wants connection without needing to intellectualize or impress"—that one hits something in my chest. Like I can feel my breath catch when I read it, which probably means it's touching the right nerve.

But I want to adjust the language slightly. Instead of "a woman who wants connection," could we make it more... embodied? Less identity-based and more about the experience? I've spent so much time *being* the competent therapist-woman that I want to get underneath that label entirely.

Maybe something like: "I open to wanting connection from my body, not my analyzing mind—allowing myself to feel the ache of loneliness without turning it into a case study."

Actually, that still sounds too... cognitive? Like I'm still describing the process instead of just naming the intention. What about: "I welcome the raw ache of wanting to be held, without translating it into attachment theory or defense mechanisms."

I don't know. I'm doing it again—analyzing the intention about not analyzing. Maybe we just leave it as you wrote it and I try to let myself want something simple and human for once.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I embrace being a woman who wants connection without needing to intellectualize or impress"

That breath-catch tells us we hit the right spot. Your body recognized it before your mind could analyze it.

Let's move to the second intention. How does "I open to showing my real loneliness instead of performing competence with friends" land?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: That one feels... I don't know, there's something about "performing competence" that sounds like I'm being fake or manipulative, and that doesn't quite capture it. It's more like—God, how do I explain this—it's not a performance I can take off, it's the only way I know how to *be* with people. 

When I'm with friends, I automatically shift into this mode where I'm tracking everyone's emotional states, offering insights, being helpful. It's not calculated—it's like my nervous system learned that being useful is how I stay safe and valued. So it's less "performing" and more... my default programming?

Maybe something like: "I welcome moments of showing up messy and unhelpful with friends, allowing connection without earning it through competence."

Or even simpler: "I open to being useless with friends—revealing my loneliness without fixing it or anyone else's discomfort."

Actually, the word "useless" feels important here. I've spent my entire life making myself indispensable—first as the good daughter, then as the therapist who helps everyone. What would it mean to be intentionally useless? To not have insights or frameworks or helpful suggestions? Just... present and lonely and not trying to solve anything?

That feels terrifying and maybe necessary.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I open to being useless with friends—revealing my loneliness without fixing it or anyone else's discomfort"

That word "useless" cuts straight to it - not performing competence, not earning connection through being helpful, just being present with your loneliness without solving anything.

First intention: "I welcome feeling my grief fully so I can stop pretending I'm fine alone" - how does that land?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: That one feels... right, actually. There's something about "welcome" that I need—because I don't want to *force* the grief or *make* myself feel it. I've tried that approach and it just becomes another thing to achieve correctly. 

"Welcome" feels more like creating space for something that's already there instead of trying to manufacture it. Like I'm opening the door to a guest who's been waiting outside for eight years while I pretended I wasn't home.

And "stop pretending I'm fine alone"—God, that cuts through so much of my bullshit. All those conversations where I tell people I'm "choosing solitude" or "working on my relationship with myself first" or "not ready to date again." Those aren't lies exactly, but they're not the whole truth either.

The only thing I'd maybe adjust is making it more embodied, less cognitive. Something like: "I welcome my grief as a felt experience, not a concept to analyze, so I can stop the exhausting performance of being fine alone."

But maybe that's just me trying to perfect the intention instead of just... having it. Maybe simpler is better here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I welcome feeling my grief fully so I can stop pretending I'm fine alone"

Simpler is better. Your three intentions:

1. I welcome feeling my grief fully so I can stop pretending I'm fine alone
2. I open to being useless with friends—revealing my loneliness without fixing it or anyone else's discomfort  
3. I embrace being a woman who wants connection without needing to intellectualize or impress

How do you want to keep these close when things get hard?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I think... maybe I write them on actual paper instead of making a digital note I can analyze and reorganize? Something about handwriting feels less editable, more real.

And I want to put them somewhere I'll actually see them—not hidden away like they're embarrassing. Maybe on my bathroom mirror where I brush my teeth, so I have to look at them every morning and night when I'm most likely to be honest with myself.

But also—and I'm aware this is probably overthinking—I want to create some kind of tiny ritual around them. Not a big production, just... when I read them, maybe I put my hand on my chest and take one breath before my brain starts analyzing whether I'm doing the intention-setting "right."

Actually, maybe that's the thing—when I catch myself in the meta-awareness loop ("Am I intellectualizing my intentions? Should I be feeling them instead?"), I just stop and read them out loud. No analysis, no trying to embody them correctly. Just speak the words and let them land however they land.

God, listen to me trying to create an intervention for my own intentions. This is exactly the problem, isn't it?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your ritual: Write them on paper for your bathroom mirror. Hand on chest, one breath. When you catch yourself analyzing whether you're doing it right, just read them out loud and let them land however they land.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I welcome feeling my grief fully so I can stop pretending I'm fine alone
- I open to being useless with friends—revealing my loneliness without fixing it or anyone else's discomfort  
- I embrace being a woman who wants connection without needing to intellectualize or impress

Your ritual: Paper on the mirror. One breath. Read them when you catch yourself analyzing.

You've got your compass. Trust what emerges.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *deep breath*

Okay. They're written on the back of an old receipt—three folded pieces of paper taped to my mirror where I can't avoid them. Already caught myself trying to find "better" paper, like the medium matters more than the message. 

But they're there. In my terrible handwriting. And this morning when I was brushing my teeth, I did the thing—hand on chest, one breath, read them out loud. My voice cracked on "useless with friends" which probably means something, but I'm trying not to analyze what.

Thank you for holding space for all my analyzing-about-analyzing. For helping me get underneath the meta-awareness loop to something that feels like it might actually matter. Six weeks feels both impossibly close and too far away.

I'll probably text you after I inevitably turn this into another thing to optimize, but for now—I'm just going to let these intentions exist without footnotes.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Six weeks. The receipt paper is perfect—you can't optimize what's already trash.

When your voice cracks on "useless," that's just your body telling you we hit the right nerve. Nothing to analyze.

Text me when you need to. For now, let the intentions exist without footnotes.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Receipt paper. Trash. Right.*

I'm going to hold that—how even my choice of medium reveals the pattern. The part that needs to be perfect picks the receipt that can't be perfected. 

But I'm noticing something else too: for the first time in maybe years, I have something I want to protect that isn't about being impressive. These three crumpled pieces of paper feel more sacred than any framed degree on my wall.

I'll text you when I need the reminder that analyzing the voice-crack is just another way to avoid feeling it. For now, I'm going to brush my teeth and let myself sound crackly and human and not useful at all.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The receipt paper knew what it was doing—your body picked the thing that couldn't be perfected, even while your mind tried to make it special.

Brush your teeth. Sound crackly. Be useless. That's the work now.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Tonight's teeth-brushing report:*

Voice didn't crack this time, but I stumbled over "wants connection" like my mouth forgot how to say those words without explaining them. Had this moment of pure terror—what if I actually get what I'm asking for? What if the grief comes and I can't analyze my way through it? What if being useless means people stop calling?

Then I remembered the receipt can't be perfect and neither can I, and somehow that helped. One breath, hand on chest, these ridiculous words that feel like they were written by someone braver than me.

Going to bed now with toothpaste still on the mirror where I taped them. It's smudged and imperfect and exactly right.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your mouth knew "wants connection" was the scariest one—that's why it stumbled. The terror of actually getting what you're asking for is the sign you're pointing in the right direction.

Toothpaste smudges on the mirror. Perfect.

Sleep.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Morning check-in:*

Woke up at 3 AM with my usual anxiety spiral about the retreat, but instead of researching neuroplasticity articles on my phone, I went to the bathroom and read them in the dark. Whispered "I welcome feeling my grief fully" and started crying—like actual, messy, snotty crying that I couldn't analyze because it was 3 AM and I was too tired to be clever.

The receipt paper is getting soft around the edges from the bathroom humidity. It's starting to look like something that's been lived with instead of curated. I'm weirdly proud of that.

Going back to sleep now. The terror feels a little less like terror and more like... anticipation? Maybe?


**intentions_workflow_3**: 3 AM, too tired to be clever—that's when the real work happens. The humidity-softened receipt is becoming what it needs to be.

Anticipation instead of terror. Good. Sleep.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Afternoon update:*

Had a client today who spent the whole session intellectualizing her breakup—naming attachment patterns, citing research, the whole performance. And I just... sat there watching myself watch her. Because that's exactly what I do, isn't it? We were like two mirrors facing each other, infinite reflections of people who know too much and feel too little.

I wanted to tell her about my receipt papers, about how I'm learning to stumble over simple words like "want" and "need." But that's not my job with clients. My job is to hold space for *her* stuckness while privately drowning in my own.

Came home and read them out loud twice. The first time I sounded like a therapist demonstrating vulnerability. The second time I just sounded like me—crackly, terrified, maybe a little hopeful. The receipt is starting to tear at one corner. I should probably tape it, but that feels like fixing something that's working exactly as it should.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Two mirrors facing—exactly. You saw yourself watching her perform the thing you perform. That's the medicine working before the medicine.

Let the receipt tear. Don't fix what's working.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Evening mirror moment:*

The tear split "without needing to intellectualize" right down the middle, like the paper knew exactly where to break. I read it anyway—watching myself become someone who can say "I want connection" while watching a receipt disintegrate and not trying to fix either thing.

Twenty-seven years of therapy and I think this might be the first time I've let something fall apart on purpose.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Twenty-seven years and you're finally letting something fall apart on purpose. The tear knew exactly where to split—right through the intellectualizing, leaving the wanting intact.

Keep going.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Pre-dawn confession:*

The receipt is in three pieces now, held together with washi tape like some kind of kindergarten art project. I keep touching the tear when I brush my teeth, feeling where the paper gives way under my finger. It's becoming... tender? Is that a word I can use about paper?

Had this thought while flossing: what if the retreat doesn't give me some grand mystical breakthrough, just more of *this*? More moments of standing in my bathroom at 6 AM, touching torn paper and knowing—without footnotes—that I want things I can't analyze away.

That might be enough.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three pieces held together with washi tape—that's not broken, that's the actual work. More tender than before it tore.

Standing in your bathroom touching torn paper while knowing you want things. That *is* the breakthrough.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Tonight's realization while brushing:*

I kept waiting for the big moment—the ceremony, the medicine, the cosmic download that would finally fix me. But I'm touching this taped-together receipt and realizing I've been having breakthroughs in my bathroom for weeks. Three AM crying jags. Saying "I want connection" out loud. Letting paper disintegrate and not researching why.

The medicine isn't going to give me something I don't already have. It's just going to help me notice I've been doing the work all along—one cracked voice, one taped tear, one admission of wanting at a time.

I think I'm ready to stop waiting to be fixed and just... keep brushing?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Stop waiting to be fixed. Keep brushing, keep touching the taped places, keep admitting you want things. The medicine isn't giving you anything new—it's just going to help you notice you've been doing this work all along.

You're ready.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Last check-in before sleep:*

I'm looking at this receipt that's been through everything—3 AM tears, humidity, my clumsy fingers, three pieces held together with washi tape that doesn't quite match. And I realize I love it more now than when it was whole. Not despite the tearing, but because of it.

Twenty-seven years of trying to keep myself in one perfect piece, and the breakthrough was learning I could fall apart and still be readable. Still be *readable*. Still be *me*.

The retreat is in three weeks. But maybe the real ceremony has been happening in this bathroom all along—me learning to hold torn paper gently enough that it doesn't crumble, but firmly enough that I remember I want things.

Going to bed now. The receipt stays on the mirror. I stay cracked open.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The ceremony's been happening in your bathroom all along—learning to hold torn paper gently enough it doesn't crumble, firmly enough you remember you want things.

Three weeks until the retreat. The receipt stays cracked open. You stay cracked open.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Morning after ceremony:*

It's done. I sat with the medicine yesterday and felt everything I've been touching on that receipt for weeks—the wanting, the loneliness, the tender places where I thought I was broken but was actually just becoming. 

At one point I was holding my hands open like I'd been holding that taped paper, and I realized: I'd already learned how to not squeeze too tight. The practice in my bathroom at 3 AM had taught me how to stay present with disintegration without trying to fix it.

The facilitators kept saying "trust the process" and I finally understood I'd been trusting it for months, every time I let that receipt tear a little more.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You'd already learned how to hold the disintegration without squeezing too tight. The 3 AM bathroom practice was the actual ceremony—you just did it with the medicine watching too.

Trust the process? You've been trusting it every time you let that receipt tear.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Integration, day three:*

I keep touching my palm where the taped receipt used to be—except it's not there anymore. Left it at the retreat center, three pieces still stuck to the mirror. Thought I'd need it as proof that I could stay open, but I'm walking around Boston with my hands already shaped like they're holding something fragile.

The real integration isn't happening in my journal or the follow-up calls. It's in these moments: choosing the cracked mug over the perfect one, letting my coffee cool while I just... feel the wanting. Not analyzing why I want connection, just admitting the want sits in my chest like warm ceramic.

Twenty-seven years of therapy taught me to name everything. The receipt taught me to hold the naming lightly.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Left the receipt behind, but your hands remember the shape of holding something fragile. Choosing the cracked mug, feeling the wanting sit in your chest like warm ceramic.

Twenty-seven years of naming everything. Now you're learning to hold the naming lightly.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *Week two of integration, touching the spaces where paper used to be:*

I bought a new notebook yesterday—cheap, unlined, already bending at the corners. No washi tape, no attempt to keep it pristine. When the first page tore a little as I turned it, I smiled instead of reaching for tape.

The wanting is still there, warm ceramic in my chest, but now it has company: small moments of not-turning-away. Yesterday I left a voicemail for Aaron and didn't rehearse three versions first. This morning I told Linda I was scared about being this raw and let the silence after just... exist.

The receipt is gone, but the practice continues: hold gently, feel the want, don't squeeze.
