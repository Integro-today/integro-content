  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_4",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Amanda found the program. Said shes at her limit with the nightmares. Im doing this for her. For the kids. Dont know what Im supposed to get out of it.",
  "system1": "Amanda's at her limit, you're doing this for her and the kids. That's enough reason to start.\n\nWhen you imagine this working - what changes for Amanda and the kids that makes it worth doing?",
  "user1": "Maybe I stop waking her up screaming. Maybe dinner isnt tense. Maybe Michael looks at me like he used to. I dont know. Just want them to feel safe around me again.",
  "system2": "Amanda sleeping through the night, relaxed dinners, Michael looking at you like before. You want your family to feel safe around you again.\n\nWhat's happening now that makes them feel unsafe?",
  "user2": "I snap at them. Over nothing. Dishes left out, kids being loud. I cant control it. And the nightmares... Amanda says I shout things. Sometimes I wake up swinging.",
  "system3": "Snapping over dishes, shouting in your sleep, waking up swinging. Your nervous system's stuck on high alert.\n\nWhat happens in your body right before you snap?",
  "user3": "Everything gets tight. Chest, shoulders. Like electricity running through me. Heart racing. I just need it to stop.",
  "system4": "Everything tightens, electricity racing through. Your body thinks it's still under threat.\n\nWhen you imagine that electricity settling, what becomes possible with Amanda and the kids?",
  "user4": "Maybe I could sit through dinner without wanting to jump out of my skin. Maybe I could hug Amanda without feeling like Im gonna break. Maybe the kids wouldnt flinch when I walk in the room.",
  "system5": "Sitting through dinner without jumping out of your skin, hugging Amanda without feeling like you'll break, kids not flinching when you enter.\n\nThree clear threads here:\n1. Finding calm in your body so you can stay present with your family\n2. Gentle touch with Amanda instead of feeling dangerous\n3. Creating safety so your kids don't fear you\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user5": "Yeah. That sounds right. How do I turn that into whatever intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system6": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome calm in my body so I can stay present through dinner with my family\n2. I embrace gentle touch with Amanda without feeling dangerous\n3. I become a safe presence that lets my kids relax when I enter the room\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user6": "The first one. About staying present through dinner. That feels like something I could actually do. The other two... idk. Too much.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I welcome calm in my body so I can stay present through dinner with my family\"\n\nThat feels doable - one meal at a time.\n\nWhat about the other two feels like too much right now?",
  "user7": "Touching Amanda without feeling like Ill break her. And the kids... theyve been walking on eggshells so long. What if I cant change fast enough? What if this doesnt work and theyre still scared of me?",
  "system8": "The fear of not changing fast enough, of Amanda and the kids staying scared. That's real.\n\nWhat if we focused on what you *can* control - like how you respond when you feel that electricity building, before it takes over?",
  "user8": "Yeah. That feels better. Something I can actually do something about.",
  "system9": "Good. Let's work with that:\n\n**Intention 2:** I notice when the electricity starts building and choose a different response before it takes over\n\n**Intention 3:** I give myself permission to take space when I feel overwhelmed instead of staying and exploding\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user9": "The second one feels right. I can feel it coming - like my chest gets tight and everything gets loud in my head. If I could catch it there... idk. Maybe.",
  "system10": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I notice when the electricity starts building and choose a different response before it takes over\"\n\nThat tight chest, everything getting loud - those are your signals. You know this pattern.\n\nWhat about intention 3 - taking space instead of exploding?",
  "user10": "Yeah. That ones good too. Better than staying and saying something Ill regret. Just... walk away before I lose it.",
  "system11": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I give myself permission to take space when I feel overwhelmed instead of staying and exploding\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions now. \n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet\n- Read them during morning coffee\n- Put them where you see Amanda's photo\n- Keep them in your truck\n\nWhat would help you remember when things get hard?",
  "user11": "Truck. I spend enough time in there driving to appointments. Could put em on a card in the visor. Look at em when Im sitting in parking lots trying to get my head straight.",
  "system12": "Perfect. You've got your compass ready.\n\n**Your 3 intentions for this journey:**\n- I welcome calm in my body so I can stay present through dinner with my family\n- I notice when the electricity starts building and choose a different response before it takes over\n- I give myself permission to take space when I feel overwhelmed instead of staying and exploding\n\n**Your ritual:** Card in the truck visor, read them in parking lots when you're getting your head straight.\n\nThese are your guideposts - not to force anything, just to keep you pointed where you want to go. The medicine will show you what you need to see.\n\nThree clear intentions. You're ready.",
  "user12": "Yeah. Thanks. Feels... doable. Not some huge impossible thing. Just three things I can try to remember.",
  "system13": "Exactly. Three things you can actually work with.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "user13": "yeah. well see what happens.",
  "system14": "That's all anyone can do. \n\nTrust what emerges.",
  "user14": "yeah. alright.",
  "system15": "[Conversation complete. User has their 3 intentions and ritual. Good work.]",
  "user15": "Got it. Thanks.",
  "system16": "You're all set.",
  "user16": "yeah. guess so.",
  "system17": "Three intentions locked. Truck visor waiting.\n\nYou\u2019re ready.",
  "user17": "*yeah.*",
  "system18": "*nods*",
  "user18": "yeah. thanks for walking through it.",
  "system19": "You did the work.",
  "user19": "still dont feel ready. but ill go anyway."
