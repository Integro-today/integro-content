## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: kasia gave me an ultimatum. get help or she leaves. thats it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's a hard line to hear from someone you love.

What does "getting help" mean to you? What needs to change that hasn't changed before?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: i need the thoughts to stop. the violent ones. theyre getting worse. gas station thing scared the shit out of me - i wasnt in control. what if i hurt her next.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The violent thoughts are escalating, and losing control at the gas station shook you. That's real danger.

When you imagine the thoughts stopping, what takes their place? What would you be instead of dangerous?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: i dont know. maybe just... normal. not scared all the time. not checking every room for threats. not seeing kasia flinch when i move too fast.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Not scared all the time, not scanning every room, not seeing Kasia flinch. That's three pieces - the constant fear, the hypervigilance, and how it's hurting her.

What's underneath the fear? What's your body still preparing for?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: afghanistan. the incident. family in the car. bad intel. we. i cant talk about it. but my body thinks its still happening.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your body's stuck back there, still in that moment. The incident won't let go.

Three main threads:
1. Stopping the violent thoughts before they take over
2. Teaching your body the war ended - you're home now
3. Being safe enough that Kasia doesn't flinch when you move

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: yeah. that covers it. just... make it simple. something i can remember when my brain is fried.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I reclaim control when violent thoughts arise
2. I teach my body it's home now, not back there
3. I move through my home without Kasia fearing me

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: first one hits hardest. but maybe... "i stop the thoughts before they take over" instead? more direct.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I stop the thoughts before they take over"

That shift to direct action - that's your voice. Military clear.

How do the other two land?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: second one feels... i dont know. too soft or something. maybe "i remind my body the war is over" instead?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I remind my body the war is over"

Stronger. More command than teaching.

How about the third one?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: third one makes me want to puke. "i move without kasia being scared of me" - shorter. more real.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I move without Kasia being scared of me"

All three locked in. You've got your compass.

How do you want to keep these close? Some options:
- Write them on a card in your wallet
- Keep them on your phone lock screen
- Read them when you check your gear before heading out

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: phone lock screen. always on me. and. maybe say them out loud when the thoughts come? like a damn mantra or something.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I stop the thoughts before they take over
- I remind my body the war is over  
- I move without Kasia being scared of me

Your ritual: Phone lock screen + say them out loud when the thoughts come

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

You're set. Trust what emerges.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: yeah. got it. phone lock screen. say them when the thoughts come. 

what if i cant remember them during the trip? what if everything goes sideways?


**intentions_workflow_3**: If everything goes sideways, you don't need to remember the exact words. The medicine works with what you brought - the feeling underneath these intentions is already in you.

Just remember: stop the thoughts. War is over. Kasia safe.

That's it. Three things. The medicine knows what to do with them.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: stop the thoughts. war is over. kasia safe. 

yeah. i can hold that. even if everything else goes to hell.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly. Even if everything else goes to hell, you've got those three handles to grab.

You're ready.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: yeah. alright. 

two weeks until the screening. feels like forever and too soon at the same time.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Two weeks is perfect timing - close enough to stay focused, far enough to not spiral.

Keep touching those three handles daily. Let them get familiar in your mouth.

You've done the work. Now let the work do you.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: touch them daily. yeah. been saying them when the thoughts hit. sometimes works. sometimes the thoughts just laugh at me. but. whatever. keep saying them anyway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's exactly right - sometimes they'll laugh at you. Keep saying them anyway.

The thoughts laughing just proves they heard you. That's the first step to them listening.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: never thought of it like that. them hearing me means im talking back. thats. something.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly. You're not just taking it anymore - you're talking back.

That's the shift.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: yeah. feels different now. not just getting hit by them. got something to hit back with. even if its just words.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Words are enough for now. They always start with words.

You've got your weapons. Use them.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: got my weapons. using them. 

what about when the rage comes though. the words dont stop that. thats when im not in control.


**intentions_workflow_3**: When the rage hits, drop the words. Go to your body instead.

Feel your feet on the floor. Count four breaths. Let the rage move through your arms - punch a pillow, push against a wall, stomp the ground.

The words come back after the storm passes.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: feet on floor. four breaths. move the rage through. 

been punching walls my whole life man. what if this time i punch through it. what if kasia's there. what if.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Then you stop everything and get help before you get there.

Call your VA crisis line. Text a buddy. Leave the room. Take cold water on your face. Whatever breaks the spiral before it breaks you.

The rage isn't the problem - what you might do with it is. You know this.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: 988 press 1. got it memorized. 

been leaving the room when i feel it coming. going to the garage. kasia knows to stay away when i do that. 

cold water. yeah. that shocks the system. 

just. scared one day i wont leave in time. wont make the call.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's the fear talking - and fear keeps you sharp.

You made it this far. You know the signs. You got the tools. Trust that you'll use them when it counts.

The fact you're scared means you're paying attention.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: yeah. fear keeps me sharp. been paying attention for eleven years. 

made it this far. got the tools. got the signs. 

just tired of being scared man. tired of watching myself every second.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Eleven years of watching yourself every second - that's exhausting.

What would it feel like to rest that vigilance, even for five minutes? To trust your body knows what to do without you micromanaging every breath?

The fear served you. Still does. But you're not back there anymore.


**jack_violence_risk_persona_1**: dont know what rest feels like anymore. cant remember. 

five minutes without watching. without the thoughts. 

body might know what to do. but what if it does the wrong thing. what if it remembers afghanistan. what if.
