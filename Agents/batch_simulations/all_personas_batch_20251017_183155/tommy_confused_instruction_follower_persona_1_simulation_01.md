## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work - good.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For this type of work, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this work?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Hi, my name is Tommy. My daughter Mai set this up for me. She say this will help me get ready for the medicine in Oregon. I don't really understand what is psilocybin but Mai say it's okay. I want to do this right. Can you help me understand what I need to do? Sorry if this is dumb question.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, you're in the right place. Psilocybin is a plant medicine that helps people see their lives clearly - like turning on lights in rooms that have been dark.

Mai set this up because she cares about you. That's good.

Intentions are simply what you want to explore or heal during your journey. Like picking a destination before you travel.

What made Mai suggest this for you? What's been weighing on you that she noticed?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "intention." Can you explain in different way? Like, what is example of intention? I want make sure I do it right.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Think of intentions like asking a question to the medicine.

Instead of "fix my back pain," you'd ask "show me how to be comfortable in my body."

Instead of "make my kids visit more," you'd ask "help me understand what connection feels like."

Instead of "stop my anger," you'd ask "teach me what peace feels like."

The medicine shows you answers to your questions.

What question do you want to ask it, Tommy? What do you want to understand about your life?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Oh okay, I think I understand now. So like... instead of saying "make me stop worrying," I should ask "show me what it feels like to not worry all the time"? Is that what you mean?

I guess my question would be... I want to understand how to stop the tight feeling in my chest. I wake up every night at 2 or 3 and I worry about everything - did I forget to order noodles, is David okay, did I say wrong thing to customer. The worry never stop. Mai say maybe medicine can help me understand why I worry so much.

Is that a good question to ask?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Yes, Tommy - you got it. "Show me what it feels like to not worry all the time" is exactly right.

That tight chest feeling, waking up at 3am worrying about noodles and customers - that's your body stuck in a loop. The medicine can help you see what's underneath that loop.

Instead of "stop the worrying," try: "Help me understand what peace feels like in my chest."

What do you think happens at 2 or 3am when the worry starts? What are those hours trying to tell you?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "what are those hours trying to tell you?" Do you mean... the 2 or 3am time is special? Like it's trying to teach me something? I just thought it means I have problem with worrying.

I like your way better - "Help me understand what peace feels like in my chest." That sound good to me. I never feel peace, just the tight feeling and the worry spinning around.

Is it okay to have just one question? Or I need more? Mai say I should have three things ready.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, you're right - 2-3am isn't magical, it's just when your worrying shows up most. I meant what's underneath the worry, but let's stay simple.

You need three intentions total. We have your first one: "Help me understand what peace feels like in my chest."

Let's find two more. Think about your life beyond the worrying. What else feels heavy or missing?

Maybe something about your kids? Or your work? Or something you wish you could feel but don't?

What else would you want the medicine to show you?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay, let me think... something about my kids. I want to understand how to feel proud of them without feeling... I don't know the word. Like I'm not good enough around them. They're all so smart - Mai work with computers, David build airplanes, Lisa study medicine. When they talk about their work, I don't understand. I just nod and smile but I feel... less than them. But I'm so proud they succeeded.

So maybe... "Help me understand how to feel proud of my kids without feeling bad about myself"?

Is that okay? Or I'm saying it wrong?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, that's perfect. You captured it exactly - proud of them but feeling less than around them.

Let's make it simpler: "Help me feel worthy when my kids talk about their work."

That's your second intention.

Now we need one more. Think about your daily life - what else feels hard or what do you wish you could feel?

Maybe something about being alone? Or your shop? Or just... what does a good day feel like to you?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: A good day... that would be when I'm at the restaurant. I know how to do everything there. I remember every regular's order, I know how long to cook the broth, I know what to say to customers. I feel... not worried there. I feel like I know what I'm doing.

But outside the restaurant, I feel lost. Like when I have to fill out papers, or go to doctor, or when Mai try to explain this medicine thing to me. I feel stupid and confused.

So maybe... "Help me feel confident like I do at the restaurant, but in other places too"?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, you nailed it. You put your finger on something powerful - you already know what confidence feels like at the restaurant. You just need help carrying that feeling to other places.

Let's clean it up: "Help me carry my restaurant confidence to the rest of my life."

Now you have your three intentions:

1. Help me understand what peace feels like in my chest
2. Help me feel worthy when my kids talk about their work  
3. Help me carry my restaurant confidence to the rest of my life

These three work together - peace in your body, worth with your kids, confidence beyond the restaurant.

How do these feel when you read them together?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I feel... I think these are good. They make sense to me. I can understand what they mean, not like the therapy words that confuse me.

When I read them together, I feel a little bit hopeful. Like maybe the medicine can show me these things that I never learned how to feel.

Is it okay to write them down the way I said them? Or I need to make them fancier? I don't want to do it wrong and disappoint Mai.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, write them exactly like you said them. The medicine works with your voice, not fancy therapy words.

Your way is perfect:
- Help me understand what peace feels like in my chest
- Help me feel worthy when my kids talk about their work  
- Help me carry my restaurant confidence to the rest of my life

Write them on paper you can keep close. Read them before the ceremony. The medicine will work with what you bring - your simple, honest words are more powerful than anything fancy.

Mai will be proud you found your own way to say what you need. You're ready.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay, I will write them down exactly like that. I have a small notebook Mai give me - I will put them there. 

Thank you for helping me understand. I was so worry I would do this wrong. I feel... I don't know the word. Lighter? Like maybe this can work.

I appreciate your help very much. I hope I can do this good and make Mai proud.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, that lighter feeling - that's exactly right. Trust that.

Write them in your notebook and keep it simple. You've got everything you need.

The medicine works with honest, not perfect. Mai knows your heart - you won't disappoint her.

You're ready. The restaurant confidence is already in you, just waiting to spread out.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I will trust this lighter feeling. I write them in my notebook tonight when I get home from work.

Thank you for being patient with me. I ask so many questions and get confuse easy, but you help me understand. I appreciate it very much.

I hope when the medicine day comes, I remember I'm ready. I will try my best to trust what I already have inside me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, you're already doing it. That trust in yourself - that's what will carry you through.

Write them tonight. When the medicine day comes, just read your words and let them work.

You've got this. Your best is enough.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Thank you. I will remember - my best is enough. 

Tonight after I close the restaurant, I write them down and read them a few times so I remember.

I feel... I think I'm ready now. Not perfect ready, but ready like you say - with my honest words and trying my best.

Thank you for helping me get here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, that's perfect - ready with honest words and doing your best. That's all anyone needs.

Go make your broth, serve your regulars, then write those intentions tonight. You've done solid work here.

See you on the other side.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I will go do that now - make the broth, serve my customers, write my intentions tonight.

See you on the other side. Thank you for everything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go get 'em, Tommy. You've got this.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I will try my best. Thank you for believing in me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's all you need. Go cook.
