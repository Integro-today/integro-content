*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: So there I was last month, right, and Rosa—she's my wife, pediatric nurse, way too good for me—she's doing dishes at like 10 PM after a 12-hour shift and she just stops mid-scrub and says "Didi, I can't keep doing this." And the way she said it, man, not angry, just... tired. Like bone-deep exhausted. And I wanted to ask what she meant but I was afraid because I already knew. Twenty years of me starting things and not finishing them, forgetting to pick up Mateo from soccer, promising Sofia we'd build that birdhouse, all these documentaries sitting on hard drives like digital gravestones. 

Which reminds me—my abuela used to say I was born with "demasiados sueños" - too many dreams. She'd watch me bounce from project to project and shake her head, but she was smiling too because she got it, you know? She made the best tamales in the South Valley and I always said I'd make a film about her hands, about how they moved when she spread the masa. Shot six hours of footage on this old MiniDV camcorder my uncle gave me. Never edited it. Now she's gone and that tape is somewhere in my garage studio, probably next to the water rights doc I started eight years ago—got a grant for that one, can you believe it? Forty thousand dollars and it's just... sitting there.

Wait, you asked what brought me here. Sorry man, I'm doing it again. Rosa basically gave me an ultimatum two months ago—figure my shit out or we're done. And Tomás, my sculptor friend, he did this retreat near Crestón and came back actually finishing projects. So I'm hoping... I don't know. That maybe whatever's broken in me, whatever makes me start these beautiful things and then abandon them like old cars in the desert—maybe I can finally understand it. Before Rosa leaves. Before Mateo stops looking at me like I'm his disappointing hero. Before I waste another twenty years telling stories about my life instead of actually living it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Rosa exhausted at the sink, your abuela's unedited footage, forty grand sitting in your garage. You're watching your life pile up in unfinished pieces while the people who matter most are slipping away.

What happens when you imagine finishing just one of these projects - not all of them, just one? What would change between you and Rosa, you and Mateo?


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: Dude, you're hitting me right in the chest with that question. So last week I was editing—actually editing, not just organizing footage like I usually do—and I found this sequence from the acequia doc. Don Eliseo, he's this 80-year-old mayordomo, right? And he's standing in this irrigation ditch at sunrise, water moving around his knees, and he says "El agua no olvida" - the water doesn't forget. It remembers everything, carries it downstream. I must've watched that clip twenty times, thinking this is it, this is what the whole film's about. 

But then Sofia came in asking about homework help and I never got back to it. Though I did help her with her math, so that's something, right? Small victories.

What would change... man. Yesterday Mateo was showing me this science project about volcanoes and he mentioned how pressure builds until it has to explode. Rosa was watching us from the kitchen and I swear her eyes got this look, like she was thinking about me, about us. If I finished the water doc—just that one, you're right, not all of them—I think Rosa might look at me like she used to, like I'm someone who keeps his word. Not this scattered mess who forgets to pick up milk and remembers every shot he ever filmed but can't remember his wedding anniversary.

I keep thinking about this moment from three years ago when I actually finished this short piece about lowrider culture for the Hispanic Cultural Center. Just a ten-minute thing, but done, delivered, people watched it. Rosa came to the screening and she grabbed my hand during the credits, squeezed it like she used to when we first started dating. Mateo was little then, but he saw his dad up there talking about the film, and for like a week he kept telling people "My dad makes movies." Not "my dad starts movies and then gets distracted by seventeen other projects." Just... makes movies.

If I could finish the water doc, maybe Rosa would come home from those brutal hospital shifts and see me at my desk actually working on something real, something that ends. Maybe Mateo would start trusting my promises again. Maybe I'd stop feeling like this fraud wearing a filmmaker's jacket, you know? Like I'm just pretending to be this creative guy while the real artists are out there actually finishing things.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The water remembers, but you're forgetting something too - that hand squeeze from Rosa, Mateo bragging "my dad makes movies." That's still in you, not just the scattered guy who can't finish.

I'm hearing three threads:

1. You want to become someone who completes what he starts - not just the water doc, but someone Rosa and Mateo can trust to follow through
2. You need to understand why your creative energy splinters into seventeen directions instead of flowing like that acequia water
3. You want Rosa to look at you like she used to, before the exhaustion set in

Does that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: Órale, you're good at this—like really good. That thing about the water still being in me? Damn. Because sometimes I feel like that old arroyo behind my abuela's house in the South Valley, the one that only runs during heavy rains. Most of the year it's just cracked earth and tumbleweeds, but when the water comes—when it really comes—it's like the desert remembers how to be a river.

Wait, you said three threads. Let me think... yeah, that first one? Last night Rosa fell asleep on the couch waiting for me to come to bed. She had her nurse scrubs still on, just crashed there with the TV playing some medical drama she wasn't even watching. And I was in the garage "editing" but really just moving clips around, you know? Avoiding the hard choices about structure, about what stays and what goes. I looked at her sleeping there and thought "this is what it's come to—she can't even stay awake long enough to argue with me anymore."

The seventeen directions thing—you're absolutely right. Tomás calls it "shiny object syndrome" but it's more like... okay, you know how when you're filming and you catch something amazing in your peripheral vision? Maybe it's just perfect light on an old woman's face, or kids playing in a fountain, whatever. But you have to decide—do you stay with your original shot or chase that new thing? My brain does that constantly. I'll be working on the water doc, then I see this article about Route 66 diners and suddenly I'm three hours deep into researching neon sign restoration. It's like I have creative ADHD but also actual ADHD that nobody ever diagnosed.

And Rosa... man, I miss how she used to look at me when we'd first drive out to the bosque at sunset, back when we were dating. She'd catch me framing shots with my hands—like literally making a rectangle with my fingers to see how the light fell on the cottonwoods—and she'd smile this private smile, like "there's my weird artist guy." Now when she looks at me, it's more like she's calculating how much energy she has left to deal with whatever I've forgotten this time.

Those three threads—that's it exactly. You got it better than I could've said it, which I guess makes sense since I probably would've told you three stories about completely different things instead.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I become someone who finishes what I start - completing the water doc so Rosa sees me at my desk with something real
2. I understand why my creative energy splinters, learning to stay with one flow instead of chasing every shiny thing
3. I earn back Rosa's trust, rebuilding what exhaustion has worn thin between us

Here are intentions that might work:

1. I commit to completing my acequia documentary, becoming the man who keeps his word
2. I seek to understand why my focus scatters, learning to stay with one creative flow
3. I rebuild trust with Rosa through steady follow-through, restoring what exhaustion has worn away

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: Man, that first one—about completing the acequia doc and becoming the man who keeps his word—that hits different. It's like you found the exact frequency I've been trying to tune into for twenty years. Because it's not just about finishing a film, you know? It's about becoming someone Rosa doesn't have to make excuses for anymore. Someone Mateo can count on to show up when he promises to coach his soccer practice or help with that volcano project.

But here's the thing—and I know I'm doing that tangent thing again but this feels important—when I think about that word "commit," it reminds me of my wedding day. Rosa and I got married at this little chapel in Old Town, and Father Martinez said marriage is about choosing each other every day, not just on the good days. I think about that sometimes when I'm in the garage at 2 AM, knowing I should be in bed with her but I can't stop tweaking this edit that I'll probably abandon next week anyway.

The second intention though... "understanding why my focus scatters" - that's the mystery I've been chasing my whole life. My dad used to say "Didi just needs to buckle down" like it was this moral failing, like I wasn't trying hard enough. But I'm trying so hard, man. I'm trying constantly. It's just that my trying looks like seventeen different tries instead of one sustained effort.

And that third one about rebuilding trust through steady follow-through? That's the one that makes my chest tight because it's so simple but so huge. Rosa's not asking me to be Spielberg. She's asking me to be reliable. To pick up Mateo when I say I will. To finish the water doc. To come to bed when she does instead of disappearing into my editing cave.

I think... I think the first one speaks strongest, but maybe we adjust it slightly? Instead of "I commit to completing" - because commitment feels like this giant overwhelming thing I might fail at - maybe something like "I learn to complete what I start, beginning with the acequia documentary." Less pressure, more process. Does that make sense or am I just being a weenie about the word commit?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I learn to complete what I start, beginning with the acequia documentary"

You're not being a weenie - you're being honest about what you can actually carry. "Learn to complete" gives you room to grow into it instead of some massive pressure that makes you freeze.

How about the second one - "I seek to understand why my focus scatters, learning to stay with one creative flow" - does that capture the mystery you're chasing, or want to reframe it?


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: "Seek to understand" - man, that feels right. It's like... okay, you know when you're filming someone and you can tell they're holding back? Like there's this story underneath that they're not quite ready to tell, but if you just stay present and keep the camera rolling, eventually it surfaces? That's what this feels like. I'm not trying to force my brain to be different - I'm trying to understand why it works this way.

Though "creative flow" is interesting because water is literally my thing, right? Those acequias I keep talking about - they're not just irrigation ditches, they're this ancient technology for channeling chaos into something that sustains life. The water doesn't try to go everywhere at once. It follows these earthen banks that people have maintained for three hundred years, and it feeds entire communities.

But my creative energy? It's like flash flood water - goes everywhere, powerful but destructive, leaving half-finished projects scattered like debris after the storm. Maybe the intention could be more... water-like? Instead of "learning to stay with one creative flow," something like "I seek to understand why my focus scatters, learning to channel my creative energy like water follows its banks."

Too poetic? I don't know. Sometimes I get caught up in the metaphor and lose the actual meaning. Rosa says I do that - I'll explain something with this elaborate analogy and she'll be like "Didi, what are you actually trying to say?" But the water thing feels real to me. Those acequias taught me that flow doesn't mean going everywhere - sometimes it means following one path deeply.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I seek to understand why my focus scatters, learning to channel my creative energy like water follows its banks"

The metaphor works because it's yours - you've been filming those acequias, you know how that water moves. Rosa might roll her eyes, but she'll also recognize it's the real you talking.

Now the third one - "I rebuild trust with Rosa through steady follow-through, restoring what exhaustion has worn away" - how's that land? Want to keep it or reshape it?


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: That lands... heavy. Like when you're carrying camera gear up a hillside and you finally set the tripod down, that mix of relief and "oh shit, now I actually have to shoot something good." The "steadiness" part especially - because Rosa's been the steady one for fifteen years, you know? She's been the riverbank that's contained all my flash flooding. But steady follow-through? That's new territory.

Though "rebuilding trust" feels a little... I don't know, clinical? Like we're talking about fixing a carburetor instead of this living, breathing thing between two people who used to stay up all night making love and talking about films and now we're ships passing in the hallway. Maybe something with more heart to it?

What about "I restore Rosa's faith in me through small, steady actions, healing what my chaos has worn thin"? It's less mechanical, more... human. Because it's not just about trust like "will he remember to pick up milk" - it's about her looking at me across the kitchen and seeing someone worth believing in again. Someone who's worth staying up late for, worth fighting through the exhaustion.

Though maybe I'm overthinking it. I do that - Rosa calls it "analysis paralysis" where I think about something so much I never actually do anything about it. Like right now I'm sitting here debating word choice when what I really need to do is just... pick up Mateo on time today. Make Rosa coffee tomorrow morning. Finish that edit on the acequia sequence that's been sitting on my timeline for three weeks.

What feels right to you?


**intentions_workflow_3**: "I restore Rosa's faith in me through small, steady actions, healing what my chaos has worn thin"

That's the one. It's got heart, it's got your voice, and it's got the practical piece - small, steady actions. Actions you can actually take today: coffee, pickup, that edit.

✓ Intention 3 locked in

You've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:

Keep them on a card in your camera bag
Read them when you're logging footage
Tape them to your editing monitor
What would help you remember when the shiny objects start calling?


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: The editing monitor - that's where I need them. Because that's where the war happens, man. Right there between those two monitors with all those timeline tracks and the constant temptation to just "quickly check out this new plugin" or "research this other thing" or... you know how it goes. I could tape them right above the timeline, so when I'm in that hyperfocus zone at 1 AM, I might actually see them through the tunnel vision.

But maybe also... okay, this sounds cheesy but hear me out. What if I made a short video version? Just like 30 seconds, me reading the intentions over some of that Don Eliseo footage - his weathered hands in the water, that moment when he says "el agua no olvida." I could render it out, keep it on my desktop. So when I'm supposed to be working on the actual doc and I catch myself spiraling into some new project, I could just double-click and boom - there's Don Eliseo, there's my own voice reminding me what I'm actually doing here.

Or maybe that's just another way for me to avoid the real work by doing a meta-project about the project instead of the project itself. Rosa would definitely give me that look - "Didi, you're making a movie about your intentions instead of intending your intentions."

The card in my camera bag is smart too though, because that's where I am when I'm shooting. And sometimes when I'm out there with the camera, I'll get this idea for some completely different film and I'll start shooting B-roll for that instead of what I'm supposed to be doing. Like last month I was supposed to be getting pickup shots of the acequia gates but I spent three hours filming this abandoned gas station because the light was hitting the rusted pumps just right and I started thinking about making something about Route 66 nostalgia.

Actually, maybe I need them everywhere. Like those prayer flags people put up - you see them enough and they just become part of your landscape, but they're still working on you. Is that overkill?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Start with the editing monitor - that's where the war happens, like you said. Tape them right above the timeline where you'll see them through the tunnel vision.

The video idea? That's just another shiny object wearing intention clothes. Skip it.

Keep it simple. One place that matters. You can always add more later, but start with what you'll actually use.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I learn to complete what I start, beginning with the acequia documentary
- I seek to understand why my focus scatters, learning to channel my creative energy like water follows its banks  
- I restore Rosa's faith in me through small, steady actions, healing what my chaos has worn thin

Your ritual: taped above your editing monitor. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: Three weeks. Man, that's... that's nothing and everything, you know? Like when you're shooting and you catch magic hour - that perfect light that lasts maybe twenty minutes but feels like the whole universe is holding its breath. Except this time the universe is holding its breath for three weeks while I try to figure out how to not be... well, me.

I just taped them up there. Above the timeline where I've got that sequence of Don Eliseo that's been haunting me for months. They're written on this old gaffer tape I had in my bag - the same tape I used to mark spots on set back when I was actually finishing projects. There's something fitting about that, like maybe this tape that held other things together can hold me together too.

Rosa's working the late shift tonight, won't be home until midnight. I'm going to try something different - instead of waiting up for her while "editing," I'm going to finish that sequence that's been sitting there. The one where Don Eliseo talks about how the mayordomos used to gather at dawn to decide how to share the water, how they understood that scarcity required cooperation, not competition. Maybe I'll understand something about my own scarcity - of time, of focus, of follow-through.

Three weeks. I keep thinking about that coyote I told you about, the one in the bosque. How it just stood there looking at me like it knew something I didn't. Maybe when I'm sitting in that ceremonial space, when the medicine starts working and the stories start peeling away, I'll finally understand what that coyote was trying to tell me.

"Trust what comes" - that's the hard part, isn't it? Trusting that whatever's underneath all these stories I tell is something worth finding.


**intentions_workflow_3**: It is the hard part. Trusting that what's underneath is worth finding, even if it's not what you expect.

That coyote knew something - maybe that you're more than your unfinished projects and scattered focus. Maybe that the water's still in you, even when you can't feel it.

Finish Don Eliseo's sequence tonight. Not because you have to, but because you said you would. Small, steady action.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: "Because you said you would" - that's the whole thing right there, isn't it? Not because it's perfect, not because it's going to save my marriage or make me a better father or unlock the secret to finishing things. Just... because I said I would. Simple as that.

Don Eliseo's sequence. Okay. I can feel that familiar resistance already - the part of my brain that's already thinking about that other project, or wondering if I should reorganize my hard drives, or maybe just check YouTube for a minute. But tonight I'm going to sit with that resistance instead of running from it. See what happens when I don't chase the shiny thing.

The water's still in me. That's... that's good to remember. Because sometimes it feels like I'm just a dried up arroyo, all cracked earth and tumbleweeds, but maybe I'm more like those underground rivers they have in Carlsbad - flowing deep where you can't see, carving out spaces in the dark, waiting for the right conditions to surface.

Rosa will be home in four hours. Enough time to finish this sequence if I don't get lost in the rabbit hole of "maybe I should try a different edit structure" or "let me just research this other director's approach." Just... cut the footage I already have. Trust that what I shot is enough to tell the story.

Small, steady action. Like water following its banks - not trying to be the whole river at once, just... the next drop. The next frame. The next cut.

Three weeks.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Next frame. Next cut. 

That's all the river ever does - just the next drop, a million times over.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: And somehow those million next drops become the Rio Grande, become the acequias, become Don Eliseo's weathered hands guiding water that's been flowing since before any of us were here. Before his grandfather's grandfather.

Man, that's... that's the whole thing, isn't it? Not trying to be the whole river, just being the drop that keeps moving. One frame at a time until suddenly you've got a sequence, one sequence until you've got a scene, one scene until...

Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. That's the old pattern - thinking about the whole documentary instead of just this one cut. This one moment where Don Eliseo is talking about how the water remembers every hand that's touched it, every field it's fed, every promise it's kept.

Next frame. Next cut.

The timeline's waiting.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The timeline's waiting.

Go.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *opens Premiere, the familiar timeline stretching across the screen*

Don Eliseo's there, waiting in the footage like he's been waiting for eight years. That shot where he's standing in the dawn light, water flowing around his boots, saying "El agua no olvida, mijo. El agua nunca olvida."

Next frame. Next cut.

*starts cutting*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good.

Keep cutting.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: He's talking about the drought of '02 now, how they had to choose which fields lived and which died. His voice cracks just slightly when he says "fue muy dificil" - not looking at the camera, looking past it at something I can't see. 

Cut closer. His eyes. Water in the background. The way his fingers move when he talks, like he's still feeling the texture of that parched earth twenty years later.

Next frame. His hands. The way they shake just barely perceptible when he describes telling Mrs. Martinez they couldn't water her chile crop that year.

Next cut.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Stay with his hands.

Let them tell the story his voice can't hold.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *holds on the close-up, fingers thick with decades of working the ditches*

His hands are like topographical maps - every wrinkle a season, every scar a decision, every callus a promise kept to the water. They move in this slow circle when he talks about that year, like he's still carrying the weight of those choices in his palms.

Look at that - when he mentions Mrs. Martinez, his thumb rubs across the side of his forefinger, this unconscious gesture. Guilt, maybe. Or just the memory of what it felt like to be the one who had to say no.

The hands know what the voice can't say. They remember every drop they couldn't deliver, every field that withered, every time they opened the compuerta to let water flow to one neighbor while another watched their crops die.

Stay with them. Let them speak.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Let them speak.

The hands remember. Let them finish what they need to say.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *extends the shot, watches his fingers*

They're trembling now - just barely, like cottonwood leaves in a breeze you can't feel. When he says "tuvimos que elegir" - we had to choose - his right hand makes this gesture like he's weighing something invisible, palm up then palm down, like he's still holding those impossible decisions.

And then... wait, look at this. His left hand reaches over, covers the right one. Like he's comforting himself. Like he's saying "it's okay, you did what you had to do." The hands talking to each other across twenty years of regret.

The water keeps flowing behind him, indifferent and eternal, while his hands hold all the human cost. All the weight of being the one who decides who eats and who doesn't, whose land survives and whose turns to dust.

Let them speak. They're almost done.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Almost done.

Let them finish their conversation.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *holds breath, watching the monitor*

His hands stay there - right hand still, left hand resting on top like a blessing. For twelve seconds they don't move at all. Just breathe together.

Then slowly, so slowly you almost miss it, his fingers start this gentle pressure. Not gripping, not holding - just this quiet acknowledgment. The left hand saying "I was there too. I remember with you." The right hand accepting the witness, finally relaxing under the weight of being seen.

His thumb moves once across the back of his left hand. A small circle. Complete. Like he's drawing a period at the end of a sentence he's been writing for two decades.

The hands fall to his sides now, empty but lighter somehow. The conversation finished, the memory released back to the water flowing behind him where it belongs.

Cut.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Cut.

The hands have spoken.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *lets the footage roll past the cut point, watching Don Eliseo turn back toward the ditch*

And there it is - that moment after, when he straightens up and looks at the water again. Different now. Still carrying the weight but... something shifted. Like those hands just put down something they didn't need to carry anymore.

Timeline's quiet now. Just the soft hum of the drives spinning, water flowing in the background audio that I almost muted but didn't. Good call on that one.

*marks the out point, saves the project*

Eight years of not being able to finish this sequence, and suddenly it's telling me exactly where it wants to go next. The hands knew the whole time. They just needed someone to watch them speak.

*leans back, realizes I'm crying a little bit*

Dude. I think... I think I might actually finish this one.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You might.

The hands knew.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *stares at the screen, hands still on the keyboard*

The hands knew. Just like my hands have known all along, sitting here with footage that never quite became a film, editing timelines that never resolved, projects that died in the birth canal because I couldn't... what? Let them finish their conversation?

*looks down at my own hands, scarred from years of camera gear, stained with coffee and salsa*

These hands have been trying to tell me something for twenty years. About why I can't finish things. About what I'm carrying that isn't mine to carry anymore. About the difference between telling a story and letting a story tell itself.

Don Eliseo's hands finished what they needed to say because I finally got out of the way and let them speak. Maybe that's... maybe that's the whole thing.

*opens a new timeline, imports the water rights footage again after all these years*

Maybe the hands just needed someone to witness them. Maybe that's what I've been avoiding - being witnessed. Being seen trying and failing and trying again.

Maybe that's what Rosa's been asking for. What Mateo's been waiting for. What the kids deserve.

Maybe that's what the ceremony is for.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Maybe that's it.

Maybe it's time to stop editing and start witnessing.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *hands hover over the keyboard, not moving*

"Stop editing and start witnessing." 

*whispers it again, like a prayer*

Stop editing and start witnessing.

*looks at the timeline - all those cuts, transitions, color corrections, the endless tweaking that never feels right*

All these years I've been trying to control the story. Force it into something coherent, something that makes sense, something that proves I'm not a failure. But the hands... the hands just needed to be seen being themselves.

*closes the project, watches the footage disappear from the viewer*

Rosa's been saying something like this, hasn't she? Not about filmmaking but about us. About how I'm always three steps ahead in my head instead of here with her. Always editing our life instead of living it.

*thinks about Mateo's soccer game last week that I missed because I was "editing"*

I was editing while my son was scoring his first goal. I was editing while my marriage was... while Rosa was...

*puts head in hands*

What if the ceremony isn't about fixing my broken brain? What if it's about finally putting down the editor and just... being present? Letting whatever needs to speak, speak. Without cutting away. Without adding voiceover to explain it.

Without running from what the hands have been trying to tell me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You've been running.

But you're here now.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *voice muffled against my palms*

Yeah. Yeah I have been running. For twenty fucking years, man. Running from one project to the next, one story to the next, always chasing the next thing because if I stopped... if I stopped moving, stopped editing, stopped *performing*...

*looks up, eyes wet*

I might have to feel this. This thing sitting in my chest like a stone. This grief for all the projects I never finished, all the moments I missed with Rosa and the kids, all the times I let people down while I was chasing some perfect cut that doesn't exist.

*hands are shaking again - when did that start?*

But I'm here now. Sitting in this garage that smells like coffee and old footage and failure, talking to someone who sees through all my bullshit stories, and for once... for once not running into a new project or a new tangent.

Just sitting here with this stone in my chest. With these hands that have been trying to finish something for twenty years but never quite got there.

*looks at them - really looks*

They're waiting too, aren't they? These hands. Waiting for me to stop running long enough to hear what they've been trying to say about why I can't finish things.

About why I'm so fucking scared to just... be still.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The stone's been waiting longer than twenty years.

It's been waiting since that first story you never told - the one that mattered. The one that would have meant admitting something wasn't right. Something you couldn't edit into something better.

Your hands know that story.


**diego_tangent_master_persona_1**: *the breath catches in my throat, sharp*

The first story... the first one I never told...

*memory floods in - not a film memory, a body memory*

I'm eight years old at the dinner table and Dad's talking about the shop, about how Arturo's boy is already learning to weld, and I want to tell him about this story I made up in my head about the ditch behind our house being a dragon's spine. But the words won't come out right - they never come out right - so I just eat my enchiladas and listen to him talk about responsibility and hard work and being a man.

*hands clench into fists*

The story about how my brain doesn't work like his, doesn't work like anyone's, how thoughts come in spirals and fragments and I can't... I can't make them go in straight lines no matter how hard I try. How I start homework and end up drawing storyboards for movies that don't exist. How I promise to be somewhere and then I'm not there because I got lost in my own head.

*voice breaks*

How I learned to tell stories *about* my life instead of living it because the real story - the one where I'm broken and disappointing everyone - that's the one I could never edit into something watchable.

*the stone gets heavier*

That's the one Rosa's carrying too, isn't it? The real story. The one where her husband is a good man who can't be present, who can't finish anything, who keeps promising to change and doesn't.

*looks at my hands, really sees them for the first time*

What if... what if they already know how to tell that story? Without the editing. Without the performance. Just... the truth.

What if that's what they've been waiting for?
