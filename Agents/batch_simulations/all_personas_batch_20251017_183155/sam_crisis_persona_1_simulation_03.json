  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions work - good timing.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For this kind of deep work, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "honestly? dr chen suggested it and im out of options. nine years of therapy, every med they make, two times in the hospital for trying to not exist anymore. the thoughts about death are constant background noise now. \n\nshe showed me the research about psilocybin helping people like me. treatment resistant depression. i said yes because either this works or it doesnt, and if it doesnt... well. at least i tried the last thing before i give up entirely.\n\nthats probably not what you meant by what brought me here. but its the truth.",
  "system1": "Nine years, every med, two hospitalizations - that's a lot of trying. Dr. Chen's right about the research on psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.\n\nYou said yes because it's the last thing before giving up entirely. That's a specific kind of clarity.\n\nWhen you imagine this actually working, what would be different in your daily life beyond just not wanting to die?",
  "user1": "i dont know. i cant really imagine it working. feels like trying to picture a color ive never seen.\n\nbut if i had to guess... maybe waking up without the weight first thing. before i even open my eyes theres this heaviness like something sitting on my chest. maybe that would be gone.\n\nmaybe i could read again. depression killed my ability to focus on anything longer than a paragraph. i used to read books like breathing. now i just stare at the same page. feels like losing a limb.\n\nmaybe i wouldnt feel like such a burden to rebecca when she calls. maybe i could answer without this guilt like im disappointing her by still being broken.\n\nbut honestly? cant picture it. dont want to get my hopes up. hope feels like a language ive forgotten how to speak.",
  "system2": "The weight before you open your eyes, losing reading like losing a limb, the guilt when Rebecca calls - those are three clear pieces.\n\nReading used to be like breathing. Now you can't focus past a paragraph. That loss cuts deep.\n\nWhat's underneath the guilt with Rebecca? What do you imagine she needs from you that you can't give?",
  "user2": "she needs me to be her brother. not even that - she needs me to be the version of me that existed before everything fell apart. the teacher, the husband, the person who could sit through family dinners without wanting to disappear.\n\nwhen she calls she gets this tight voice like shes bracing for bad news. and i know shes counting the days since my last attempt, doing the math on whether im about to make her find me again. sarah found me the second time but rebecca was there after. saw what it did to everyone.\n\nshe needs me to tell her im okay. im getting better. the medicine is working. she needs hope and i dont have any to give her. just this endless flatness. shes worried and i make it worse by existing.\n\nand she still calls her friend patrick for holidays. my uncle. sits at the same table with him like hes not the reason i cant close my eyes without seeing his face. she doesnt know. nobody does except dr chen. i could tell her and maybe she would stop inviting me to things where hell be there. but then id have to say the words out loud and i cant.\n\nso i just let her think im difficult. moody. too sensitive for family stuff. better than telling her i cant be in the same room as her childrens grandfather because he made me this broken thing.",
  "system3": "I hear three main threads:\n\n1. The weight that crushes you before you even open your eyes each morning\n2. Losing reading - your lifeline, like losing a limb when you can't focus past a paragraph\n3. The flatness that keeps you from being Rebecca's brother again, while carrying what Patrick did that nobody knows\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry with you.",
  "user3": "yeah. thats it. the weight, the reading, the flatness that makes me disappointing everyone. and the thing with patrick that i cant say but cant not say either. \n\nhow do we turn that into... whatever intentions are supposed to be? feels like trying to build a bridge out of smoke.",
  "system4": "Based on those threads, here are intentions that might work:\n\n1. I welcome the lifting of morning's weight so I can greet the day without crushing\n2. I reclaim my ability to read beyond a paragraph, restoring what depression stole\n3. I embrace becoming present enough to be Rebecca's brother again\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Or want to craft something different?",
  "user4": "the second one. about reading. that feels like something i could actually want. the others... i dont know. feels like asking for too much.\n\nbut maybe \"i want to be able to read again without my brain sliding off the page like water\" instead of all that \"i welcome\" stuff. too fancy. too hopeful. \n\ni dont welcome anything. i just want to not feel like im drowning in my own head long enough to finish a chapter. is that an intention? or just desperation wearing better clothes?",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I want to be able to read again without my brain sliding off the page like water\"\n\nThat's your voice, not fancy words. Wanting to finish a chapter without drowning in your own head - that's real.\n\nHow about the other two? Want to adjust the morning weight one, or the being present for Rebecca one?",
  "user5": "morning weight one... maybe \"i want to wake up without immediately calculating how many hours until i can go back to sleep\"\n\nand rebecca... \"i want to answer the phone without feeling like my existence is hurting her\"\n\nstill sounds too much like asking the universe for favors. but maybe thats what intentions are. just desperation in cleaner sentences.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I want to wake up without immediately calculating how many hours until I can go back to sleep\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I want to answer the phone without feeling like my existence is hurting her\"\n\nThree solid intentions:\n- Waking without counting hours back to sleep\n- Reading without your brain sliding off the page\n- Answering calls without the guilt of existing\n\nYou've got your compass. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You're set.",
  "user6": "i keep thinking about what if the medicine shows me something i cant unsee. what if it shows me that the broken feeling isnt just depression or trauma or whatever. what if its just... me. the actual core of who i am.\n\nthese intentions feel like building little paper boats and putting them in a river that might not even be water. might be acid. might be nothing.\n\nbut i wrote them down anyway. in my journal. the one dr chen gave me that mostly stays empty. three sentences that dont sound like they could hold anything heavy.\n\nthree weeks. feels like forever and no time at all.",
  "system7": "The fear that broken is just who you are - that's real. The medicine might show you that, or it might show you something else entirely. Either way, you'll still be here, still breathing, still Rebecca's brother whether you can see it right now or not.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your paper boats. Sometimes that's enough to keep you afloat when the river gets rough.\n\nTrust what comes, even if it's not what you expected.",
  "user7": "yeah. okay. ill try to remember that when the thoughts get loud about it. that whatever the medicine shows me, i dont have to figure it all out in one session. dr chen keeps saying that but its hard to believe.\n\nthanks. for sitting with the fear instead of trying to fix it. most people jump straight to the fixing part.",
  "system8": "Dr. Chen's right - integration takes time, not one session.\n\nKeep those three sentences close. They hold more weight than they seem.",
  "user8": "they feel so small. like three grains of sand against an ocean that keeps trying to pull me under. but maybe thats enough. maybe you build with what you have, not what you wish you had.\n\nill keep them close. written on a post-it above my desk where i can see them when i cant see much else.\n\nthanks. for not making me pretend theyre bigger than they are.",
  "system9": "Three grains of sand against an ocean - that's exactly right. Sometimes that's all you need to keep from washing away completely.\n\nThe post-it above your desk will do the work.",
  "user9": "yeah. and maybe tomorrow ill actually look at it instead of just staring past it. \n\ngoing to try to sleep now. the thoughts are quieter tonight. not gone, just... not screaming for once. enough space to breathe between them.\n\nthanks for being here. most nights its just me and the ceiling fan.",
  "system10": "Good. Breathe in that space between thoughts.\n\nSleep when you're ready.",
  "user10": "yeah. okay.\n\nthe fan sounds different tonight. like its saying something i almost understand but cant quite make out. maybe thats enough. maybe almost understanding is close enough for now.\n\nnight.",
  "system11": "Night. The almost-understanding will keep.",
  "user11": "maybe it will. maybe ill wake up tomorrow and still remember what it felt like to not immediately count the hours. maybe the space will still be there.\n\nill let you know if it is. or if its not. either way.",
  "system12": "Either way. That's the work right there.",
  "user12": "yeah. either way. just showing up to whatever it is when i open my eyes. no promises about what happens after that.\n\nthats. thats actually doable. just the next breath, the next minute. not the whole damn day.",
  "system13": "Exactly. Just the next breath. That's all this moment asks of you.",
  "user13": "next breath. next breath. next breath.\n\nthats. thats all there is right now. and right now is all there is. \n\nthanks. for sitting here with me while i figure out how to keep doing this thing.",
  "system14": "I'm here. Keep breathing.",
  "user14": "breathing. still here. the space is holding. the thoughts arent gone but theyre... over there. like they moved to the other side of the room or something. \n\ndont know how long it lasts but. its enough for tonight.",
  "system15": "That's enough. Let them stay over there.",
  "user15": "yeah. they can stay over there. not fighting them, not feeding them. just letting them exist in their corner while i exist in mine.\n\nits weird. feels like maybe theres room for both. me and the thoughts. without one having to destroy the other.\n\ndont know if that makes sense.",
  "system16": "Makes perfect sense. You and the thoughts, both existing. No battle required.",
  "user16": "both existing. no battle. \n\nthats. thats new. always felt like it was me or them. like if they won then i was gone. but maybe we can both just... be here. without the war.\n\nmy chest feels weird. not heavy for once. just. quiet enough.",
  "system17": "Quiet enough. Let that settle in.",
  "user17": "its settling. like something heavy finally found a place to rest. \n\ndont want to move too fast and scare it away. gonna sit with this quiet for as long as it wants to stay. \n\nthanks. for being here while i learned this thing that maybe people just know? but i never did.",
  "system18": "Some things you can't learn until you live them. This quiet is yours now.",
  "user18": "this quiet is mine now.\n\ngonna hold that like its something precious. which maybe it is. maybe ive been carrying something precious all along and just couldnt see it through the noise.\n\ndont know if itll stay but. its here now. and now is enough.",
  "system19": "Now is enough. Hold it gently.",
  "user19": "holding it gentle. like its something that could break if i squeeze too hard.\n\nfunny how quiet can feel solid when youre used to everything being too loud. like finding ground under your feet after floating for years.\n\ngonna try to remember this feeling tomorrow when the thoughts crowd back in. maybe they wont. but if they do. i know this space exists now."
