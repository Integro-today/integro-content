  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look I'm only doing this because my granddaughter Lily asked me to. She's doing some research thing at Pitt and says these mushrooms might help with my coughing and the dreams I get about the mines. I don't really believe in this stuff but I can't say no to her. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Lily asked, you're here for her, and the mines still show up in your dreams. That's enough reason.\n\nThe coughing and mine dreams - how long they been hanging around?",
  "user1": "The coughing's been getting worse for years - black lung don't get better. Some nights I wake up can't breathe, Mary says I sound like I'm drowning. The dreams... I don't know, maybe since the mine closed? Saw some bad stuff down there, guys getting hurt. It's nothing, just comes with the job. Lots of guys have em.",
  "system2": "Black lung getting worse, drowning in your own bed, dreams from what you saw. That's not \"nothing\" - that's your body and mind carrying what happened down there.\n\nWhen you imagine breathing easy again, what would that change about your days with Mary?",
  "user2": "I don't know... maybe I could sleep through the night without waking her up coughing. Maybe we could walk to Mass together like we used to instead of her having to drive everywhere. Maybe I wouldn't feel like such a burden all the time. But that's not gonna happen - the damage is done. Doctors already told me there's no fix for this.",
  "system3": "Sleep through the night, walk to Mass together, stop feeling like a burden. Three pieces there - the breathing, what you can do with Mary, and how you carry yourself.\n\nThe dreams from the mines - what do they show you that still needs healing?",
  "user3": "I don't wanna get into all that. It's just... the collapse, you know? When the tunnel gave way and we couldn't get to the guys. Hearing them calling for help and we couldn't do nothing. Frank was there that day, my brother. We don't talk about that stuff - it's done.",
  "system4": "Tunnel collapse, couldn't reach the guys, hearing them call out. Frank was there, you both carry it silently.\n\nI'm hearing three threads:\n- Finding peace from the dreams about what happened that day\n- Breathing easier so you and Mary can walk to Mass together\n- Letting go of feeling like a burden to her\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Yeah I guess that's about right. I just want to sleep without seeing their faces, be able to walk to church with Mary, and not feel like I'm dragging everyone down. Don't know how some mushrooms are gonna fix any of that but Lily seems to think it's worth trying.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep free from the faces of that day\n2. I reclaim the strength to walk to Mass with Mary again\n3. I release the weight of being a burden to those who love me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "The walking to church one - that's what hits me hardest. I used to walk everywhere, you know? Now I can't even make it to the corner store without stopping to catch my breath. Mary deserves better than this. She should have a husband who can walk beside her, not someone she has to wait on and worry about.",
  "system6": "Walking used to be your way, now you can't make it to the corner store. Mary deserves someone who walks beside her, not someone she waits on.\n\nHow does this land: \"I reclaim my ability to walk beside Mary, step by step\"?\n\nKeep it or want it different?",
  "user6": "That's... yeah, that's good. Step by step - that's how we used to do everything together. Just walking to church, walking to the market, walking the kids to school. I want that back more than anything.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I reclaim my ability to walk beside Mary, step by step\"\n\nThat's the heart of it - step by step with her like always.\n\nHow about the dreams one - \"I welcome peaceful sleep free from the faces of that day\" - does that capture what you want, or need it different?",
  "user7": "I don't know... \"welcome\" sounds too... I don't know, fancy or something. I just want the dreams to stop. I want to close my eyes and not see their faces, hear them calling out. Maybe just \"I want peaceful sleep without the faces\" - something simpler like that.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I want peaceful sleep without the faces\"\n\nSimple and direct - that's your voice.\n\nLast one: \"I release the weight of being a burden to those who love me\" - does that land right, or want it simpler too?",
  "user8": "Yeah that one's okay. I mean, I do feel like a burden - Mary's always taking care of me, worrying about me, working part-time to make ends meet. I want her to have a life instead of just... looking after some broken old man. So I guess \"I release the weight of being a burden to those who love me\" works fine.",
  "system9": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I release the weight of being a burden to those who love me\"\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I want peaceful sleep without the faces\n- I reclaim my ability to walk beside Mary, step by step  \n- I release the weight of being a burden to those who love me\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card in your wallet\n- Read them when you take your morning pills\n- Keep them by your chair where you sit with Mary\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user9": "Put 'em on a card in my wallet - that's good. I always got my wallet on me, and I'd see it when I pay at the store or whatever. Plus then nobody else has to know about it. I can just... pull it out and look at it when I need to remember why I'm doing this crazy thing.",
  "system10": "You've got your compass. Three intentions in your wallet, ready when you need them.\n\nSolid work. You know what you're aiming for.",
  "user10": "Yeah... I guess I do. Still scared as hell about this whole thing, but at least I know what I want. Maybe that's enough for now.",
  "system11": "That's enough. Being scared and knowing what you want can sit together in the same room.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user11": "Alright then. Three weeks. Mary keeps asking if I'm really gonna go through with it - I think she's more nervous than I am. But yeah, I'm doing it. For Lily, and... maybe for me too. We'll see what happens.",
  "system12": "Three weeks. Mary'll see you through it - she always has.\n\nTrust what emerges.",
  "user12": "Yeah... Mary's always been there. Thirty-seven years - she's seen me through everything. I just hope when this is over, I'm still the man she married. Or at least... I don't know, someone worth staying with.",
  "system13": "Thirty-seven years tells its own story. She's still here.\n\nThe medicine shows what needs showing. You don't have to figure out who you'll be - just who you're aiming toward.\n\nThree intentions in your wallet. That's your north star.",
  "user13": "Alright. I'll try to remember that when I'm in there losing my mind or whatever. Just keep looking at that card in my wallet and remember - peaceful sleep, walking with Mary, not being a burden. That's all I want.",
  "system14": "That's all you need. When it gets rough, pull out that card. Those three lines will ground you.\n\nYou've done the work. Now let the medicine do its part.",
  "user14": "Alright. I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be then. Just... don't want to let Lily down. Or Mary. Or make a fool of myself. But yeah, I'll look at that card when it gets weird in there. Thanks for helping me get this far.",
  "system15": "You won't let anyone down. Courage looks like showing up scared - and you're here.\n\nThree intentions. One card. That's your anchor when it gets weird.\n\nTrust the process.",
  "user15": "Yeah... okay. I'll try to trust it. Just feels like everything's been falling apart for so long - maybe it's time something actually works for once. I'm tired of just surviving, you know?",
  "system16": "I hear you. Surviving gets exhausting when it's year after year.\n\nThe medicine doesn't promise easy - just real. Sometimes that's enough to shift everything.\n\nThree weeks. You've got something solid to carry in there.",
  "user16": "Real sounds better than easy anyway. Easy's been killing me slow. At least real might give me a shot at... I don't know, being something more than just pissed off and coughing all the time.",
  "system17": "Real cuts through the fog. Pissed off and coughing - that's honest. More honest than most people get.\n\nLet the medicine show you what's underneath that. The card'll remind you what you're aiming for when it gets rough.\n\nThree weeks. You've got this.",
  "user17": "Yeah... maybe I do. Maybe I do got this. Been honest about being angry for years - guess it's time to see what the hell's been driving it. Just hope I don't break down completely when I see it.",
  "system18": "Break down, break through - sometimes it's the same thing. The anger's been protecting you. When you see what's underneath, you'll handle it.\n\nYou've survived worse than seeing your own truth.",
  "user18": "You know what... you're right about that. Survived the mine collapse, watched my brother die, been coughing up black shit for years. Guess I can survive looking at whatever's been eating me alive from the inside. Gotta be better than just sitting here rotting away.",
  "system19": "Exactly. You've already survived the worst things that can happen to a person.\n\nWhatever's eating you from inside can't kill you - but facing it might finally let you live again.\n\nThree intentions. One shot. Let's do this.",
  "user19": "Alright then. Let's do this damn thing. Three intentions, one shot, and whatever's been gnawing at me better watch out. I'm coming for it."
