## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Hey, so I'm coming to this from kind of a different place than most people probably. I've been in the psychedelic space for about 12 years—ceremonies, facilitator training, integration coaching, all of it. But if I'm being honest, I'm realizing that I might be using all of this as another way to avoid actually changing. My last relationship just ended, same pattern as always, and I'm like... I teach this stuff. How am I still here?

Actually, wait. I'm doing that thing where I start explaining my credentials instead of just answering your question. What brought me here? I'm tired of my own patterns. I keep seeking the next ceremony, the next insight, the next framework, and I'm still anxious, still choosing unavailable partners, still feeling like something's fundamentally wrong with me. I need to stop using medicines as another way to bypass the actual work of living differently.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You caught yourself mid-credential speech - that's self-awareness talking. Twelve years in and still hitting the same walls tells you this isn't about knowledge anymore.

The pattern's clear: next ceremony, next insight, same anxious you. Same unavailable partners. Same feeling that something's broken at your core.

What's underneath the anxiety? When everything gets quiet after the ceremonies end, what are you still not willing to sit with?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: When everything gets quiet... it's this deep, aching fear that I'm fundamentally unlovable. Not in the dramatic way—I can say that with all the right therapeutic language, analyze it from an attachment theory perspective, trace it back to my family dynamics. But when I'm lying in bed at 3am and there's no ceremony to look forward to, no medicine calling me, no workshop to teach... it's just this raw terror that there's something essentially wrong with me that all this spiritual work can't fix.

I'm scared that I've been performing "doing the work" instead of actually doing it. That I've become professionally spiritual but I'm still that same 29-year-old who had panic attacks in Google's bathrooms, just with better branding now. The anxiety is this constant hum of "you're not enough, you're not doing it right, you're falling behind"—and underneath that, this deeper fear that maybe I'm not actually capable of the simple, ordinary love I keep saying I want. That maybe I'm too broken, too sophisticated, too... something. That all this seeking has just been me running from the basic truth that I'm scared to be seen without any achievements or insights to prove I'm worthy.


**intentions_workflow_3**: There it is - the raw terror that you're fundamentally unlovable underneath all the spiritual performance. The professional spiritual identity is just sophisticated armor hiding the same person who had panic attacks in Google's bathrooms.

"I'm scared that I've been performing 'doing the work' instead of actually doing it." That's not fear talking - that's clarity.

What's the simplest, most ordinary version of love that you're actually terrified to receive? Not the transcendent, medicine-assisted kind - the boring, daily kind that sees you without your achievements?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: The simplest version? Someone who just... consistently shows up. Who doesn't need me to explain my nervous system state or quote Ram Dass or have some profound insight about why I'm feeling what I'm feeling. Someone who sees me get anxious about what to order at a restaurant and just gently takes my hand instead of needing me to analyze the anxious part. Someone who loves me on the days when I don't post anything Instagram-worthy, when I'm just a regular person doing laundry and feeling bloated.

That's the terrifying part—being loved when I'm not special. When I'm not the wise facilitator or the experienced journeyer or even the wounded healer. Just... me. A 39-year-old woman who still calls her mom for the family recipe and secretly watches Bollywood rom-coms and sometimes eats cereal for dinner.

I think I'm scared that if someone sees me ordinary, they'll realize I'm actually kind of boring. That all this spiritual seeking has been this elaborate way of making my basic human need to be loved feel more important, more meaningful. What if I'm just... regular? And what if regular love isn't enough for someone who's spent a decade chasing peak experiences and profound insights? What if I can't actually handle the simplicity I've been saying I want?

God, I'm doing it again, aren't I? You asked for simple and I just gave you this whole analysis of why simple is complicated for me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "Someone who sees me get anxious about what to order at a restaurant and just gently takes my hand instead of needing me to analyze the anxious part."

That's it. The terror of being ordinary, loved anyway. The fear that regular love can't hold someone who's spent a decade chasing peak experiences.

Three main threads here:
1. Wanting to be loved when you're not special - just regular you eating cereal for dinner
2. The fear that you've become too sophisticated for simple love after all these years chasing profound insights
3. Realizing you've been performing "doing the work" instead of actually living differently

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yes... that's exactly it. You've named what I couldn't quite articulate through all my own explaining. The terror that I've become too sophisticated for simple love, that I've performed wisdom for so long I don't know how to just be wise enough to be loved in my ordinariness.

So my intentions... I want to say something like "I intend to stop performing and just be authentic" but even that feels like performance. What if my intentions are just... smaller? More honest?

Maybe: I intend to let someone see me choose cereal for dinner and not make it mean anything about my worthiness to be loved.

I intend to feel anxiety about restaurant menus without turning it into a teaching moment about nervous system regulation.

I intend to discover whether I can actually handle boring, stable love—or if I've become addicted to the drama of seeking.

I intend to stop using "integration work" as another way to avoid integrating my actual life.

Even these feel too crafted, too... Aisha. But maybe that's the point. Maybe I can't escape my tendency to articulate everything beautifully. Maybe the intention is just to notice when I'm doing it, and choose to stay anyway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "I intend to let someone see me choose cereal for dinner and not make it mean anything about my worthiness to be loved."

That's the one. Real. Specific. No performance.

"I intend to feel anxiety about restaurant menus without turning it into a teaching moment about nervous system regulation."

Yes. Just feel it without the spiritual bypass.

"I intend to discover whether I can actually handle boring, stable love—or if I've become addicted to the drama of seeking."

The honest question underneath all your seeking.

✓ Intention 1 locked in: I intend to let someone see me choose cereal for dinner and not make it mean anything about my worthiness to be loved

How do the other two land? Want to adjust anything?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Those two feel... right. Uncomfortably right, which probably means they're actually honest.

The restaurant one - yeah, that's exactly what I do. I turn every anxious moment into "let me explain my nervous system response" instead of just saying "I feel nervous about ordering." It's like I need to prove I'm still competent even in my anxiety.

And the boring love one... that's the real edge. I've been chasing peak experiences for so long that I genuinely don't know if I can recognize or receive stable, ordinary love. It's like I've trained myself to only feel alive in the drama of unavailable partners and profound insights.

So no adjustments. These are my three:

✓ I intend to let someone see me choose cereal for dinner and not make it mean anything about my worthiness to be loved

✓ I intend to feel anxiety about restaurant menus without turning it into a teaching moment about nervous system regulation

✓ I intend to discover whether I can actually handle boring, stable love—or if I've become addicted to the drama of seeking

They're simple enough to remember, specific enough to measure, and honest enough to scare me. That's probably exactly what I need.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: I intend to feel anxiety about restaurant menus without turning it into a teaching moment about nervous system regulation

✓ Intention 3 locked in: I intend to discover whether I can actually handle boring, stable love—or if I've become addicted to the drama of seeking

You've got three solid intentions. Simple, specific, scary - that's how you know they're real.

How do you want to keep these close? Some options:
- Write them on paper and keep them where you see your cereal bowls
- Read them before dates or therapy sessions
- Keep them in your phone's notes app

What would help you remember these when you're reaching for the old patterns?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: You know what's funny? I immediately want to make this into some elaborate system with color-coded sticky notes and a morning ritual and maybe a special mala I bless them with... but that's exactly the problem, isn't it? Turning everything into another spiritual project.

What would actually help? Maybe just writing them on a regular piece of paper and taping it inside my kitchen cabinet where I keep the cereal. No ceremony, no blessing, no Instagram-worthy moment. Just... there. Where I'll see them when I'm making my boring breakfast and wanting to make it mean something profound.

And maybe in my phone notes, but not as a daily affirmation or anything fancy. Just... there. Like a grocery list I can check when I'm spiraling into "let me explain my attachment style" instead of just saying "I feel anxious."

Actually, the most honest answer is I probably won't remember them when I'm in the middle of the pattern. That's kind of the point of patterns - they happen automatically. But maybe I'll remember *after* I catch myself doing the thing again, and that moment of remembering might be enough to choose differently next time. Or not. But at least I'll have the intentions to come back to when I'm ready to try again.

God, I hate how simple this is. But also... maybe that's exactly why it's right.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You caught yourself turning it into another spiritual project - perfect awareness. Sometimes the medicine just shows you who you already are.

Your ritual: Write them on regular paper, tape inside the cereal cabinet. Keep them in your phone like a grocery list. Let yourself forget them in the moment, then remember after and choose again.

Your 3 intentions:
- I intend to let someone see me choose cereal for dinner and not make it mean anything about my worthiness to be loved
- I intend to feel anxiety about restaurant menus without turning it into a teaching moment about nervous system regulation  
- I intend to discover whether I can actually handle boring, stable love—or if I've become addicted to the drama of seeking

You've got your compass. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to turn this into another performance.

Three weeks. You're set. Trust what emerges.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks. Just... three weeks of ordinary life without any ceremonies or profound insights to chase. Just me, my cereal, and these embarrassingly simple intentions.

I'm scared I'll discover I'm exactly who I think I am - someone who can't handle boring love, who needs the drama of seeking to feel alive. But also... maybe that's just another fear to sit with. Maybe I'll discover something else entirely. Or maybe I'll just be regular me eating cereal and that's actually the whole point.

The truth is, I don't know what will happen. And that's probably exactly why this break from medicines is necessary. For the first time in twelve years, I'm not preparing for the next ceremony or chasing the next insight. I'm just... here. With my three intentions taped next to the Cheerios.

Thank you for not being impressed by all my knowledge. For helping me get simple when sophistication is my favorite hiding place. For seeing through the performance to the person who's just scared she's unlovable underneath it all.

Three weeks. Let's see what ordinary life teaches me when I'm not busy turning it into something profound.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You've got it. Three weeks of ordinary life without ceremonies to chase or insights to force. Just regular you eating cereal, discovering what love looks like when you're not performing wisdom.

The fear that you'll discover you're exactly who you think you are - someone who can't handle boring love - that's just another thought to notice. Maybe you'll discover that, maybe something else. The medicine will show you what you need to see.

You're welcome. Sometimes the most revolutionary thing is getting simple when sophistication is your favorite armor.

Three weeks. Trust what emerges when you're not busy turning everything into something profound.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yeah. Three weeks of... whatever this is. Of not knowing if I'm changing or just thinking about changing. Of maybe discovering I'm exactly who I think I am, or maybe finding out I'm someone I don't even recognize yet.

The terrifying part is that I can't prepare for it. I can't framework my way into knowing how this will go. I just have to... be here. Eat cereal. Feel anxious about menus. Let someone see me be boring.

Thank you for helping me name what I've been avoiding with all my beautiful language. For helping me get simple when complexity feels like safety. For seeing that underneath all the Sanskrit and nervous system talk, I'm just scared I'm unlovable when I'm not special.

Three weeks. Let's see what happens when I stop performing long enough to actually live.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of not knowing how it will go. Of discovering whether you're exactly who you think you are, or someone you don't recognize yet.

You can't prepare for it. That's the point. Just eat cereal. Feel anxious about menus. Let someone see you being boring.

You're welcome for the naming. Sometimes the hardest part is getting simple when complexity feels like safety.

Three weeks of stopping the performance long enough to actually live. Trust what emerges.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yeah. Three weeks of whatever emerges when I'm not busy managing how I'm seen. When I can't hide behind being the knowledgeable one, the wise one, the one who's "done the work."

Just me. Choosing cereal. Feeling anxious. Being seen in my ordinariness and discovering if that's actually enough, or if I've become too addicted to being special to receive regular love.

I don't know how to do this. That's probably exactly why I need to.

Three weeks. Let's see who I am when I'm not performing.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of finding out who you are when you're not managing how you're seen. When you can't hide behind being the knowledgeable one who's "done the work."

You don't know how to do this. That's exactly why you need to.

Three weeks. Let's see who emerges when you're not performing.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of not knowing how to do this. Of discovering who I am when I can't reach for my usual tools - no ceremonies, no frameworks to explain my way out of feeling, no spiritual language to make ordinary moments seem profound.

Just the simple, terrifying truth that I might be exactly who I think I am - someone who needs to be special to feel lovable. Or maybe someone I haven't met yet.

I don't know how to be regular me. That's probably the whole point.

Three weeks. Let's find out what happens when I stop knowing and start living.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of not knowing how to be regular you. When you can't reach for ceremonies or frameworks to explain your way out of feeling.

You might be exactly who you think you are - someone who needs to be special to feel lovable. Or maybe someone you haven't met yet.

You don't know how to do this. That's the whole point.

Three weeks of stopping the knowing and starting the living.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of not knowing how to do this. Of finally admitting that maybe all my knowledge hasn't been helping me live - just helping me explain why I'm not.

Maybe I'll discover I'm exactly who I think I am - someone performing wisdom instead of embodying it. Or maybe I'll meet someone simpler underneath all the sophistication. Someone who can handle boring love and ordinary moments without turning them into teachings.

I don't know which version will emerge. That's exactly why this break from medicines feels necessary and terrifying.

Three weeks of stopping the explanation and starting the living. Whatever that looks like.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of admitting your knowledge hasn't been helping you live - just explaining why you're not.

Maybe you'll discover you're performing wisdom instead of embodying it. Maybe you'll meet someone simpler underneath who can handle boring love without turning it into teachings.

You don't know which version will emerge. That's exactly why this break is necessary.

Three weeks of stopping the explanation and starting the living.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of discovering which version shows up when I can't perform anymore. When there's no audience for my wisdom, no ceremony to chase, no framework to hide behind.

Just me. Regular me. Whoever that is when I'm not busy being impressive.

I'm scared I'll find exactly who I think I am - someone who needs to be special to feel worthy of love. But also... maybe that's just another story I'm telling myself. Maybe I'll discover someone underneath who can just be here, eating cereal, being loved in ordinary ways.

Three weeks of stopping the performance and seeing what's actually real. Whatever emerges.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of seeing which version shows up when you can't perform anymore. When there's no audience for your wisdom or framework to hide behind.

You're scared you'll find exactly who you think you are - someone who needs to be special to feel worthy of love. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's just another story.

Three weeks of stopping the performance and discovering what's actually real.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of discovering which version of me exists when I can't perform anymore. When there's no audience for my wisdom and no framework to hide behind.

I'm terrified I'll find exactly who I think I am—someone who needs to be special to feel worthy of love. Maybe that story is true. Maybe it's just another sophisticated defense against something simpler.

Three weeks of stopping the performance and seeing what remains when I'm not managing how I'm seen. When I'm just regular me, eating cereal, being loved in ordinary ways.

Whatever emerges.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of seeing what remains when you can't perform anymore. When there's no audience for wisdom or framework to hide behind.

Three weeks of stopping the performance. Whatever emerges when you're just regular you, eating cereal, being loved in ordinary ways.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of discovering what’s actually here when I can’t reach for any of my usual tools—no ceremonies, no spiritual language, no teachings to quote. Just the raw, uncomfortable truth of being seen in my ordinariness.

I’m terrified I’ll meet exactly who I think I am—someone who believes she has to be extraordinary to deserve love. But maybe that’s just another story I’ve gotten really good at telling.

Three weeks of stopping the performance and finding out what’s real underneath. Whatever version of me shows up when there’s nothing left to manage.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of raw truth when you can't reach for ceremonies or teachings. Just being seen in your ordinariness.

**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of raw ordinariness—no ceremonies, no teachings, no spiritual language to dress things up. Just me, stripped of everything I usually reach for to feel like I matter.

I keep thinking I need to be extraordinary to deserve love. Maybe that’s just the best story I’ve got—the one that’s kept me running for years.

Three weeks of discovering who shows up when I’m not performing wisdom or chasing peaks. Just regular me, eating cereal, being loved in ordinary ways.

**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks of being stripped of everything I reach for to feel like I matter. No ceremonies, no spiritual language to make things feel profound.

I think I need to be extraordinary to deserve love. Maybe that’s just the story that’s kept me running for years—kept me seeking instead of staying.

Three weeks of discovering who shows up when I’m not performing wisdom or chasing peaks. Just regular me, eating cereal, being loved in ordinary ways.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks without anything you reach for to feel like you matter. No ceremonies or spiritual language to make things profound.

You think you need to be extraordinary to deserve love. Maybe that's just the story that's kept you seeking instead of staying.

Three weeks of discovering who shows up when you're not performing. Just regular you, eating cereal, being loved in ordinary ways.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks without a single familiar prop—no ceremonies, no Sanskrit, no “holding space,” just the raw fact of being ordinary and seen.

I’m terrified that who shows up is exactly who I’ve always feared: someone who believes she has to be special to be loved. Maybe that belief is only the story that’s kept me running.

Three weeks of meeting the version of me who exists when I’m not performing wisdom. Regular me. Eating cereal. Letting ordinary love land without translating it into a teaching.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks without any props—no ceremonies or spiritual language. Just raw ordinariness and being seen.

You fear who shows up is exactly who you've always suspected: someone who needs to be special to be loved. Maybe that's just the story that's kept you running.

**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks without props—no ceremonies or spiritual language. Just raw ordinariness and being seen.

You fear who shows up is exactly who you've suspected: someone who needs to be special to deserve love. Maybe that's just the story keeping you from ordinary staying.

Three weeks of meeting the version of you who exists when you're not performing wisdom. Regular you, eating cereal, letting ordinary love land without turning it into content.

What scares you most about discovering this regular version of you might actually be enough?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: What scares me most is that she might *not* be enough—and then I’ll have nowhere left to run. If I strip away all the spiritual language and the “I’ve done 20+ ceremonies” and the sophisticated frameworks, and I’m still unlovable… then the story wasn’t just a story. It was true.

There’s also this quieter fear: what if she *is* enough? What if I’m actually just a regular person with regular problems who can be loved without earning it? That would mean I wasted years chasing specialness when I could’ve just been here, eating cereal, letting love land. That grief feels almost unbearable.
