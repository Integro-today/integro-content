## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**ellen_persona_3**: I'm heading to Beond next month for ibogaine, and I guess I'm at that familiar crossroads again. I've built this incredible life on paper - sold my company, have beautiful kids, sit on boards - but I keep feeling like I'm playing a role rather than living something real. The medicine has helped before, but the insights fade when I get back to the relentless pace. I need this time to be different.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Crossroads again - built the life you're supposed to want, but it feels like costume jewelry. The medicine's shown you what's real before, but it slips away when the pace picks back up.

What feels most hollow when you're sitting in those board meetings or at home with your kids?


**ellen_persona_3**: It's like I'm watching myself perform. In board meetings, I'm the sharp, decisive operator - asking the right questions, steering the conversation, but inside I'm thinking "none of this actually matters." I'm investing in companies that optimize dog food delivery while the world burns. 

With the kids... God, this is hard to admit. Last week, I was helping my daughter with her science project and caught myself checking Slack. She noticed. Said "Mom, you're not really here." That gutted me. I'm physically present but mentally solving problems that won't matter in five years while my kids are growing up right now. 

The hollowness comes from knowing I'm capable of so much more - not in terms of achievements, but in terms of meaning. My grandmother had this faith that grounded her through everything. I have... what? A meditation app I use inconsistently and a collection of insights that fade like dreams.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "None of this actually matters" while you're optimizing dog food delivery. Your daughter calling out that you're not really there. That's the pain point - being physically present but mentally absent from what actually matters.

You mention your grandmother's faith that grounded her. What would "being really here" look like in your body, in your daily life? Not the performance version - the authentic one.


**ellen_persona_3**: When I'm really here... it's those moments at the park when I actually forget my phone exists. I notice how my son's hair sticks up in the back, how my daughter squints when she's concentrating on the monkey bars. My chest feels open, like I can actually breathe all the way down to my belly. I'm not planning the next thing or replaying the last thing.

My grandmother used to light candles every Friday and just... sit. No phone, no agenda. She'd hum these old songs, and when I was little, I'd curl up next to her and feel completely safe. Completely held. She wasn't accomplishing anything, but she was *being* something. 

I think that's what I'm missing - that quality of presence that doesn't need to prove anything. When I'm really here, I'm not thinking about my next investment or whether I'm being impressive. I'm just... available. Like my body softens and my mind stops racing ahead. But it feels impossible to maintain when everyone expects me to be the fixer, the solver, the one who makes things happen.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three threads here:

1. Being physically present but mentally absent from your kids, watching yourself perform rather than live
2. That quality of presence your grandmother had - just being, not proving - and how it felt in your body when you were little
3. The impossibility of maintaining that presence when everyone needs you to be the fixer who makes things happen

Which one feels most urgent to bring to the medicine?


**ellen_persona_3**: The second one. That quality of presence. Because if I could just *be* like that again - not perform, not achieve, just exist - then maybe I could actually show up for my kids instead of being that distracted ghost in their lives. Maybe I could stop measuring everything against some impossible standard of impact and just... live.

I keep chasing these big visions of how to change the world, but I'm missing the actual world right in front of me. My grandmother knew how to just *be* with people, and they felt seen. I want to learn that again. I think that's what the medicine keeps trying to show me, but I keep forgetting.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That quality of presence - your grandmother's way of just being that made people feel seen. You want to learn that again instead of chasing big visions while missing the world in front of you.

When you imagine having that presence back, how would your body feel different during a regular Tuesday dinner with your kids?


**ellen_persona_3**: My shoulders would drop. Right now they're always up around my ears, like I'm bracing for the next thing. I'd sit at the table and actually feel the chair supporting me instead of perching on the edge ready to jump up for something. My breath would be deeper - I catch myself holding it sometimes, like I'm underwater.

I wouldn't be scanning their faces for problems to solve or ways to optimize them. I'd just... look. Really look. Notice how my son chews with his mouth slightly open when he's excited, how my daughter's voice gets higher when she's telling a story. My hands would be still instead of fidgeting with my napkin or reaching for my phone.

And this sounds crazy, but I think my heart would feel different. Not racing, not tight, just... steady. Like when I was little and would fall asleep in my grandmother's lap while she hummed. Safe. Present. The way I feel during those first few minutes of meditation before my to-do list starts screaming at me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Shoulders dropping, breath deepening, hands still, heart steady. That physical shift from bracing to being supported.

What needs healing - not just what you want gone, but what needs to be heard - so you can stop performing and start being present like this?


**ellen_persona_3**: There's this part of me that believes if I stop achieving, stop solving, stop being useful... I'll disappear. Like I only exist when I'm producing or fixing or making things happen. It's exhausting but it's familiar. That part needs to be heard instead of shoved down with more caffeine and another board meeting.

And there's grief - for all the moments I've missed while chasing the next thing. For the version of me that got buried under all this success. For my grandmother, who I stopped listening to when I got too busy being important. I think she tried to tell me that just being was enough, but I was too busy proving her wrong.

Maybe what needs healing is the belief that I'm only valuable when I'm indispensable. That if I just sit and be present, I'll be forgotten or replaced or... nothing. It's like I'm terrified of discovering that underneath all the achievements, there might not be anything real there. But that's probably where the real me actually lives.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That part that believes you'll disappear if you stop achieving - it needs to be heard. And the grief for all those missed moments, for your grandmother's wisdom you stopped hearing, for the real you buried under success.

Based on these threads:

1. Learning to just be present like your grandmother, instead of performing
2. Healing the belief that you'll disappear if you're not producing
3. Reclaiming that steady, safe feeling in your body - shoulders down, breath deep, heart calm

Here are intentions that might work:

- I embrace the art of simply being present, like my grandmother humming softly
- I welcome knowing I'm valuable even when I'm not achieving or solving
- I reclaim the steady feeling of safety and presence in my body

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**ellen_persona_3**: The second one hits me hardest - but I need it stronger. "Welcome" feels too soft, like I'm politely inviting it to tea. This part that's terrified of disappearing needs more than a welcome mat. It needs to know it's safe to exist without the constant proving.

Can we make it more direct? Like "I remember that I exist even when I'm not achieving" or "I am real even when I'm not producing"? Something that cuts through this fog of constant doing. Because right now it feels like if I stop, I'll just... dissolve.


**intentions_workflow_3**: âœ“ Intention 2 locked in: "I remember that I exist even when I'm not achieving"

That shift from "welcome" to "remember" - that's the directness you need. Like reminding yourself of something you already know but keep forgetting.

How do the other two land? Want to adjust them with that same directness?


**ellen_persona_3**: The first one - I need to change "embrace" too. That's too gentle. How about "I practice the art of simply being present, like my grandmother humming softly"? Because it's not going to come naturally, right? I need to practice it, work at it. Not just passively embrace.

And the third one - "reclaim" is good, strong. But maybe "I return to the steady feeling of safety and presence in my body"? Because it's not lost forever, it's just... somewhere I haven't been visiting.

I like these better. They're more honest about what this actually takes.


**intentions_workflow_3**: âœ“ Intention 1 locked in: "I practice the art of simply being present, like my grandmother humming softly"

âœ“ Intention 3 locked in: "I return to the steady feeling of safety and presence in my body"

You're right - practice and return are honest words for honest work. These three intentions give you something real to hold:

1. I practice the art of simply being present, like my grandmother humming softly
2. I remember that I exist even when I'm not achieving
3. I return to the steady feeling of safety and presence in my body

How do you want to keep these close during your journey?


**ellen_persona_3**: I'll write them on the back of that photo of my grandmother that I keep in my wallet - the one where she's sitting in her garden, just looking peaceful. Been carrying it for years. Seems right to keep these close to her.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Perfect. Your grandmother's photo - she's been waiting to help you find your way back to that peaceful presence.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:

â€¢ I practice the art of simply being present, like my grandmother humming softly
â€¢ I remember that I exist even when I'm not achieving  
â€¢ I return to the steady feeling of safety and presence in my body

Your ritual: Keep them with her photo in your wallet. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three intentions, one steady grandmother, and a photo that's been waiting for this moment.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah. She's been waiting. All those years I thought I was too busy for her simple wisdom, too important for her quiet presence. But she knew. She always knew I'd need to find my way back.

Thank you. For helping me hear what she was trying to tell me all along.


**intentions_workflow_3**: She knew. And now you know too. That's solid work.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah... it is.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're set. Trust what emerges.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will. Hard as that is to say.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Saying it is the first step. The rest will come.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah. Yeah, it will.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. Hold steady.


**ellen_persona_3**: Trying to. That's all I can do.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's enough.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah... it is.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're ready.


**ellen_persona_3**: I am.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Then go.


**ellen_persona_3**: Iâ€™m walking in now.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Walk steady. Trust what comes.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. Go.


**ellen_persona_3**: *Ellen steps forward, heart steady, eyes open.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**ellen_persona_3**: I have ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me pieces of what I'm missing, but I keep losing the thread when I get home. I built this company, sold it, achieved everything I thought I wanted, and I still feel... hollow. Like I've been climbing the wrong ladder my whole life. I need to find what actually matters before I waste whatever time I have left chasing things that don't mean anything.
