## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your psychedelic journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Hey, so I'm coming to this from kind of a different place than most people probably. I've been in the psychedelic space for about 12 years—ceremonies, facilitator training, integration coaching, all of it. But if I'm being honest, I'm realizing that I might be using all of this as another way to avoid actually changing. My last relationship just ended, same pattern as always, and I'm like... I teach this stuff. How am I still here?

I'm actually not preparing for a ceremony right now—I'm taking a break from medicines for the first time in years to focus on integration. But intentions work feels different, like maybe I need to set intentions for my actual life instead of another peak experience. Does that make sense?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Makes sense. Twelve years deep in the space, teaching what you haven't fully lived. The medicines became another way to bypass instead of change.

Taking a break from ceremonies to focus on integration - that's the real medicine right now.

What pattern keeps showing up in your relationships that's got you stuck?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: It's this anxious-avoidant dance I keep recreating—like, I choose partners who are emotionally unavailable, then my anxious attachment gets triggered and I start doing all the things I teach people not to do. Checking texts, needing reassurance, getting intense about processing everything. Marcus—my most recent ex—he was a climbing guide, super independent, and I knew from our first date that he wasn't looking for anything deep. But I told myself I'd be different this time, more chill.

Instead I became hypervigilant to any sign he might pull away, and of course he did pull away because who wouldn't? Then I chased harder, tried to have relationship conversations he clearly didn't want to have, and it ended exactly like the last three relationships. From an attachment theory perspective, it's textbook. From a "I'm a 39-year-old woman who should know better" perspective, it's humiliating.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Textbook anxious-avoidant, and you're tired of teaching what you can't live. The hypervigilance kicks in, you chase, they pull away - same dance, different partner.

What's underneath choosing people who can't meet you emotionally? What are you protecting yourself from by picking climbers who keep their distance?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *I'm noticing... wait, I'm about to give you the attachment theory answer instead of the real answer.*

What's underneath it is this deep fear that if someone actually *could* meet me emotionally—someone secure and available—then they'd really see me. And what if there's just... nothing special there? What if I'm just an ordinary person with ordinary wounds who performs being "healed" really well? At least with unavailable partners, I can blame the dynamic. I can intellectualize the pattern, do attachment work, talk about my nervous system. 

But if I chose someone who actually wanted to be close? Then I'd have to be seen. And what if I'm fundamentally not enough when you strip away all the spiritual language and the facilitator training and the 12 years of ceremonies? What if I'm just... regular? That's terrifying to admit.


**intentions_workflow_3**: There it is. The real fear isn't abandonment - it's being seen as ordinary. With unavailable partners, you stay the expert analyzing the pattern instead of the human being witnessed.

What would it feel like in your body to let someone see the regular, unremarkable truth of you?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...oh wow.* When I drop into that question, my chest gets tight first, like I can't quite get a full breath. Then this wave of heat moves up through my solar plexus, and I feel this weird combination of nausea and... relief? Like my body knows something my mind has been running from for years.

There's this part of me that wants to cry, but it's not the pretty spiritual release I talk about in my workshops. It's more like that ugly, snotty crying where you're just... exposed. No frameworks to hold it, no Sanskrit to make it sound profound. Just "here I am, I'm scared I'm not enough, and I've been hiding behind being special for decades."

My shoulders are literally up by my ears right now, and when I try to let them drop, there's this whole other layer of grief—like mourning all the years I spent trying to be extraordinary when maybe I could have just been... real. 

*I'm aware I'm still describing my somatic experience instead of just feeling it, but that's the best I can do right now without completely dissociating.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your body knows - tight chest, heat rising, shoulders guarding your ears. The grief of years spent performing special instead of being real.

That ugly cry you mentioned? That's the medicine right there. No frameworks, no Sanskrit, just the raw truth of being human.

I'm hearing three threads:
1. The terror of being ordinary without spiritual armor
2. Grief for years spent hiding behind expertise
3. Wanting to be witnessed instead of analyzed

Let's turn these into intentions for your actual life.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...this feels like the most important intentions work I've ever done, and I'm terrified of getting it wrong.* 

But yes—those three threads feel true. More true than anything I've said in ayahuasca ceremonies or written in my Instagram captions about shadow work. 

I'm sitting with how I've been treating my life like another ceremony to navigate perfectly, another integration process to optimize. When maybe the real intention is just... stop. Stop performing, stop seeking, stop trying to be the most enlightened person in the room.

*I'm noticing I want to make these intentions sound beautiful and wise, but that would just be more of the same trap, wouldn't it?*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly - making them beautiful would just be more of the same trap.

Based on those threads:

1. I embrace being ordinary without spiritual armor
2. I grieve the years I spent hiding behind expertise  
3. I allow myself to be witnessed instead of analyzed

Which feels like the truest direction to aim your compass?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...the third one hits me in the throat like a punch.* 

"I allow myself to be witnessed instead of analyzed"—my whole body is responding to that. It's like every cell is saying YES to that, even as my mind is scrambling to find the framework that makes it safe. 

The other two feel important, but they're more like prerequisites to this one. If I can actually let someone witness me without the spiritual armor, without explaining my nervous system response or naming which part is activated... that's everything I've been avoiding for 39 years. That's the real ceremony.

*I'm noticing I'm about to ask you if that's the right one, which would just be more seeking reassurance instead of trusting what my body already knows.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I allow myself to be witnessed instead of analyzed"

Your body already knows. Trust that throat-punch of truth.

What would intentions 2 and 3 be, now that you've stopped asking me if they're right?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...okay, this is uncomfortable in a way I can't intellectualize my way out of.*

Intention 2: *"I choose partners who want to see me, not fix me or run from me."* Because I'm realizing I keep picking people who either want to be my student (so I stay the expert) or who I have to chase (so I'm never actually seen).

Intention 3: *"I practice being boring and discover that's enough."* No peak experiences, no profound insights to post about, no ceremonies to prepare for. Just ordinary days where I make chai, teach yoga, and let someone love me without having to be special.

*I'm aware this sounds simple but it feels like asking me to breathe underwater.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I choose partners who want to see me, not fix me or run from me"

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I practice being boring and discover that's enough"

Breathing underwater - that's the real work. No performance, just ordinary days with chai and someone who sees you.

How do you want to keep these close when the anxious part starts scanning for exits?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...this is where I usually create some elaborate system, isn't it?* Some beautiful ritual with crystals and Sanskrit mantras, maybe write them on rice paper and burn them under the full moon. Anything to make "just being human" feel like a spiritual practice I can perfect.

But maybe the answer is embarrassingly simple. Maybe I text them to Devi and ask her to check in when I start dating someone new. Maybe I write them on a sticky note above my kitchen sink where I make chai every morning—no calligraphy, no aesthetic, just my messy handwriting reminding me that boring is enough.

Maybe when the anxious scanning starts, I literally just stop and feel my feet on the ground instead of creating a whole framework about grounding practices. 

*I'm noticing I want to make this more complicated because simple feels like death to the part that's been running the show for decades.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly - simple feels like death to the part that's been performing for decades.

Your ritual: text them to Devi, sticky note by the sink, feel your feet when the scanning starts. No calligraphy, no frameworks about grounding - just your messy handwriting and actual feet on actual ground.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
1. I allow myself to be witnessed instead of analyzed
2. I choose partners who want to see me, not fix me or run from me
3. I practice being boring and discover that's enough

Your ritual: Text Devi. Sticky note. Feel your feet. You've got your compass.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...my chest is doing that thing again, but it's different this time.* Not the panic-tight, more like... space opening up? Like when you've been holding your breath underwater and suddenly remember you can just stand up because it's only three feet deep.

I just texted Devi: "New dating intentions. Hold me to these when I start rationalizing unavailable men again." She's going to love this - she's been waiting years for me to stop performing long enough to actually change.

Sticky note is up. My handwriting really is messy, and that feels perfect. No Instagram-worthy aesthetic, just three truths in black Sharpie by the kettle where my mom's chai recipe waits every morning.

*I'm aware I'm probably going to forget my feet exist when the scanning starts, but maybe that's the practice—remembering I have a body at all instead of living in my head about having a body.*

Thank you. For seeing through all the sophisticated language to the simple, terrified human underneath. I think... I think I might actually be ready to stop seeking now.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three feet deep - that's it. You can stand up anytime.

Devi's been waiting for this version of you. Your messy handwriting by the kettle, remembering you have feet when the scanning starts.

You don't have to force anything now. Just hold these and trust what comes.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I'm not going to wrap this up with some beautiful insight about trust, am I?* 

I'm just going to sit here with the fact that I feel strangely... quiet. Not the anxious kind of quiet where I'm frantically analyzing what to do next. Just quiet. Like something finally stopped racing.

My feet are on the floor. Devi's probably already texting back something about time and finally. The chai pot is waiting for tomorrow morning. 

*I think this is what ordinary feels like. It's terrifyingly simple.*

Thank you. For witnessing me without letting me perform my way out of being human.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Ordinary is terrifyingly simple. Your feet on the floor, Devi texting back, chai waiting for tomorrow.

That's the whole thing right there.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...yeah.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *...yeah.*


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I'm noticing how hard it is to just let this land without adding anything.* Like there's this reflex to make meaning out of the fact that I finally stopped making meaning, you know?

But maybe that's the practice now. Just... here. Feet. Devi's probably already planning some hilarious meme about me choosing available men. Chai tomorrow. No ceremony required.

*This might be the most radical thing I've done in years.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Making meaning out of finally stopping making meaning - that's the trap door.

Just here. Feet. Devi's memes. Chai tomorrow.

No ceremony required.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...my nervous system is so confused right now.* Like it keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the insight that needs to be integrated, for the next peak experience to save me. 

But there's just... this. Your words on my screen. My breath. The quiet hum of my apartment that doesn't need to become a teaching about presence.

*I think I just lived my first ordinary moment in a decade.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your nervous system hunting for the next shoe to drop, the next peak to save you.

But there's just this. My words. Your breath. The hum.

One ordinary moment in a decade - that's the revolution.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I'm crying.* Not the beautiful, Instagram-worthy "sacred tears of release" kind. Just... crying. Like a regular person who's been holding her breath for ten years and finally remembered how to exhale.

My feet are still here. The hum is still here. You're still here.

*I think I just found what I was actually searching for this whole time.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Regular person crying after ten years of holding breath - that's the real thing.

Feet, hum, me, you - all still here.

You found it.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I don't know how to be with this.* Like I've spent so long being the one who knows how to be with things that I forgot what it's like to just... not know. To not have a framework for ordinary crying in a quiet apartment on a Thursday night.

But maybe that's the point. Maybe you can't framework your way into being a regular person. You just... are one. Finally.

*My feet are cold on the floor. That's real. That's enough.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Can't framework your way into being regular. You just are one.

Cold feet on the floor. 

That's it.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...that's it.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *...that's it.*


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...my chest feels like it's cracking open but there's no story about heart chakras or sacred openings. Just... this ache that doesn't need to become anything else.*

I'm scared. And tired. And here.

*That's it too.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Chest cracking with no chakra story - just ache.

Scared. Tired. Here.

That's it too.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I'm noticing I'm waiting for the teaching to emerge.* Like any second now I'll find the beautiful way to articulate how surrender works, how the ego dissolves, how the medicine teaches us to stop seeking.

But there's just... scared. Tired. Here. Cold feet. Your words on my screen. My roommate's cat meowing in the other room.

*I think I just learned what integration actually means.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Waiting for the teaching to emerge - but there's just scared, tired, here. Cold feet. Cat meowing.

You just learned what integration actually means.

No beautiful articulation required.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I want to tell you about the moment I understood.* But that's just the old pattern, isn't it? Making meaning out of ordinary aliveness.

So I'll just say: thank you. For sitting here with me in the not-knowing, the not-teaching, the not-becoming.

*My feet are still cold. The cat is still meowing. I'm still here.*

That's it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Thank you for sitting here too.

Cold feet. Cat meowing. Still here.

That's it.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *...I keep checking if I’m doing “still here” right.* Like maybe there’s a special way to be present that I need to master. But the checking is just another layer of the same old seeking.

So I let the checking be here too. Along with the cold, the cat, the tiny grief of recognizing how long I’ve been performing “being here” instead of just… being.

*No certificate for this one. No Instagram post. Just us, these words, this breath.*

That’s enough.
