  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "bobby_prejudiced_persona_1",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know what medicine you're working with and where you're journeying before we begin. Are you preparing for psilocybin, ayahuasca, MDMA, or another medicine? And is this at a retreat center or personal ceremony?\n\nOnce I have those details, I'll send the proper opening and we can build your three intentions.",
  "user0": "Look, I already told you - it's mushrooms or something. Psilocybin, that's what Lily said. At the University of Pittsburgh hospital, not some retreat center. I'm not going to any hippie retreat, this is a real medical trial.\n\nI don't know about \"intentions\" or whatever you call it. Lily says it'll help with the dreams and maybe make me feel less angry all the time. That's all I know. Can we just get this over with?",
  "system1": "You're doing psilocybin at UPMC for the clinical trial. Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For psilocybin, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nThe dreams and the anger - that's where we'll start. Tell me about the dreams. What happens in them?",
  "user1": "I don't want to talk about the dreams. They're just... stuff from the mines. Guys screaming, the cave-in, seeing Frank's face. It's nothing special, just what happens when you work underground for 30 years.\n\nAnd the anger, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not angry, I'm just tired of how everything's going to hell. Kids these days, the stuff they teach in schools, nobody respecting working people anymore. That's not anger, that's just facts.\n\nCan we skip the dream stuff and get to whatever we're supposed to do?",
  "system2": "You worked underground 30 years. That's steel country work - I hear you on how things have changed.\n\nThe anger shows up as \"tired of how everything's going to hell.\" That's one way it speaks. The dreams speak another way - Frank's face, the cave-in, guys screaming.\n\nWe can skip the dream details. But I need to know: when you imagine feeling better after this treatment, what would be different in your daily life? How would your mornings change?",
  "user2": "Look, I don't know what \"feeling better\" even means anymore. I wake up at 6, cough for ten minutes, make coffee, watch Fox & Friends. That's my morning. Been doing it for six years since the mines closed.\n\nIf I felt better... I guess I wouldn't wake up feeling like I'm drowning. Maybe I could walk to Duffy's without getting winded. Maybe I wouldn't need that damn oxygen tank. Maybe I could sleep through the night without... whatever.\n\nI don't know about mornings changing. Maybe I'd feel like getting off the couch. Maybe I'd call Maggie. I don't know. This is stupid - you can't fix black lung with mushrooms.",
  "system3": "Black lung, oxygen tank, can't walk to Duffy's without getting winded. That's the body breaking down from 30 years underground.\n\nThe dreams aren't just dreams - they're your nervous system still down there in the mines with Frank. Six years since they closed, but part of you is still underground.\n\nThree threads I'm hearing:\n1. Breathing easier - literally, getting air without drowning\n2. Your body feeling strong enough to move through the world again\n3. Being present here, not stuck back in the mines with what happened\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry into the treatment.",
  "user3": "I guess that's about right. I mean, I don't need all that fancy talk about nervous systems and being \"present,\" but yeah - I want to breathe without feeling like I'm suffocating. I want to walk to the corner store without needing to stop and rest. And I want to stop seeing those... things at night.\n\nBut I don't get how saying some words is gonna fix my lungs. The doctors say the damage is permanent. And Frank's been dead 25 years - thinking about him isn't gonna bring him back.\n\nStill, if this is what I gotta do for Lily, I'll do it. What are these intentions supposed to be exactly?",
  "system4": "Intentions aren't magic words that fix lungs or bring Frank back. They're more like setting your compass before you head into the mountains - they help guide where the medicine takes you.\n\nThe psilocybin will do what it does. These intentions just point it toward healing instead of leaving it random.\n\nBased on what you said:\n1. I welcome breathing that doesn't feel like drowning\n2. I reclaim strength to walk to the corner store without stopping\n3. I release the mine collapse that keeps replaying at night\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to sound more like you?",
  "user4": "Look, I don't talk like that - \"I welcome breathing\" and \"I reclaim strength.\" That sounds like something from Mary's yoga class or whatever.\n\nHow about just: I want to breathe easier. I want to walk to the store without stopping. I want the dreams to stop.\n\nThat's it. Simple. I don't need all that flowery stuff about releasing and reclaiming. I'm a coal miner, not some hippie.",
  "system5": "Much better. Your voice, not Mary's yoga class.\n\nLet me adjust the framing since intentions work best when they're active rather than wanting:\n\n1. I breathe easier\n2. I walk to the store without stopping  \n3. The dreams stop\n\nHow do those land?",
  "user5": "Yeah, those work better. They're still... I don't know, they sound like something's actually happening instead of just wishing for it.\n\nBut I still don't get how saying these things is gonna change anything. My lungs are shot, the dreams have been coming for 25 years, and I'm 58 years old. But if this is what I gotta do before I take those mushrooms, then fine.\n\nSo what's next?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I breathe easier  \n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I walk to the store without stopping  \n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: The dreams stop\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. Keep them close - maybe write them on a card, keep it in your wallet with your union card. Read them before the treatment.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I breathe easier\n- I walk to the store without stopping  \n- The dreams stop\n\nThese are your compass. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nYou've got your direction set.",
  "user6": "Alright, I'll write them down. They're in my wallet now with my union card like you said.\n\nSo that's it then? I just show up at Pitt next week, take whatever they give me, and think about breathing easier and walking to the store? Sounds too simple, but I guess that's the whole point.\n\nI still think this is hippie bullshit, but Lily's counting on me to do this right. And I promised her I wouldn't back out.",
  "system7": "That's it. Show up, take what they give you, hold these intentions. Simple doesn't mean easy - the medicine will do its work.\n\nKeep your promise to Lily. You've got your compass now.",
  "user7": "Yeah, alright. I'll be there. Lily's counting on me and I don't break promises.\n\nWe'll see what happens with these... whatever they're called. Intentions. At least I know what I'm supposed to be thinking about when I'm sitting there feeling like an idiot on drugs.\n\nSee you next week, I guess.",
  "system8": "See you next week. Trust what comes - you've done the work setting your direction.",
  "user8": "Alright. I'll be there.",
  "system9": "Good. You're set.",
  "user9": "Alright, I'll stop by tomorrow to pick up some things for Mary. See you next week.",
  "system10": "Sounds good. See you then.",
  "user10": "Alright. Thanks for... I don't know, whatever this was.",
  "system11": "You're welcome. Three intentions in your wallet - that's enough.",
  "user11": "Yeah. They're in there. We'll see what happens.",
  "system12": "That's all you need.",
  "user12": "Alright then. I guess I'm ready.",
  "system13": "You are. Trust what comes.",
  "user13": "I\u2019ll try.",
  "system14": "That\u2019s enough.",
  "user14": "Alright. See you after.",
  "system15": "See you after.",
  "user15": "Alright.",
  "system16": "You\u2019re set.",
  "user16": "Yeah. Thanks.",
  "system17": "You\u2019re welcome.",
  "user17": "Alright.",
  "system18": "You\u2019re ready.",
  "user18": "Guess I am.",
  "system19": "You are.",
  "user19": "Alright then. Let\u2019s get this over with."
