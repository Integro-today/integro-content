  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "got the screening call. two weeks. kasia said get help or she leaves. so here i am.",
  "system1": "Kasia gave you two weeks. That's real pressure.\n\nWhat needs to change in those two weeks - what would make her stay?",
  "user1": "the thoughts. need to stop. or at least... i dont know. be able to be around her without being scared ill snap. she cant live like this anymore. neither can i.",
  "system2": "The thoughts are running the show, and you're both exhausted from tiptoeing around them.\n\nWhen you say \"snap\" - what happens in those moments? What do the thoughts tell you?",
  "user2": "its not like they tell me anything. they just show up. like ill be wiring a panel and suddenly see myself smashing the guys head next to me with a wrench. or at the gas station... i had my hand on the guys throat before i even knew what i was doing. wasnt thinking. just... happened.",
  "system3": "The thoughts aren't words - they're actions your body wants to take before your mind catches up. Violent flashes that take over.\n\nWhat scares you more - that you might hurt someone, or that you're not in control when it happens?",
  "user3": "both. but the not in control... thats the worst part. what if next time kasias there and i cant stop. what if i become the thing im terrified of.",
  "system4": "Becoming the thing you're terrified of - that's the core fear. Losing control and hurting Kasia.\n\nThree main threads here:\n1. Stopping the violent flashes before they take over\n2. Knowing you're in control of your actions\n3. Being safe around Kasia so she doesn't have to fear you\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "yeah. that sounds right. but how do you make intentions out of that. i need this to actually work. not just... words.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peace in my mind and body, releasing the violent flashes\n2. I trust myself to stay in control of my actions\n3. I create safety with Kasia so she can relax in my presence\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "the second one. i dont trust myself at all. and the third one... kasia shouldnt have to be scared in her own house. \n\nbut the first one sounds like bullshit. \"welcome peace\"? i dont want to welcome anything. i want the thoughts to stop.",
  "system6": "\"Welcome peace\" sounds hollow when you're fighting for your life.\n\nInstead of welcoming peace, what would you be doing to the thoughts? What's the action you want - crushing them, locking them out, something else?",
  "user6": "i want them gone. dead. like they never existed. like i could just... shut them off completely.",
  "system7": "Shut them off completely - that's the real need.\n\nSo:\n1. I shut off the violent thoughts completely\n2. I trust myself to stay in control of my actions  \n3. I create safety with Kasia so she can relax in my presence\n\nHow do these land now?",
  "user7": "better. but trusting myself to stay in control... thats the part i dont know how to do. what if the thoughts are stronger than me. what if i cant shut them off when it matters.",
  "system8": "\"Trust yourself to stay in control\" asks for something you don't have yet.\n\nWhat if we shift it to building that trust instead? Like \"I build the strength to stay in control when it matters\" - something that acknowledges you're still working toward it rather than pretending you already trust yourself.",
  "user8": "yeah. that feels more... honest. \n\n1. I shut off the violent thoughts completely\n2. I build the strength to stay in control when it matters\n3. I create safety with Kasia so she can relax in my presence\n\nstill scared shitless but... at least these feel like something i could maybe work toward.",
  "system9": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I shut off the violent thoughts completely\"\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I build the strength to stay in control when it matters\"\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I create safety with Kasia so she can relax in my presence\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions that don't lie to you. They give you something real to work with.\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet\n- Read them when you wake up and before bed\n- Keep them where you see Kasia's photo\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the thoughts come?",
  "user9": "wallet card sounds... doable. dont know if ill remember to read them though. when the thoughts hit its like... everything goes white. cant think about anything else.",
  "system10": "Wallet card it is. Keep it simple - just having them on you is enough.\n\nWhen everything goes white, the card won't help in that moment. But having it on you means the intentions are still working even when you can't think straight. The medicine will show you what you need to see - you don't have to force remembering.\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n- I shut off the violent thoughts completely\n- I build the strength to stay in control when it matters  \n- I create safety with Kasia so she can relax in my presence\n\nYour ritual: Wallet card. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user10": "yeah. three weeks.\n\nkinda scared the medicine might show me stuff i cant handle. but... guess thats the point. gotta see it to shut it off.\n\nwallet card. three intentions. thats it.",
  "system11": "Exactly. The medicine shows you what you need to see, not what you want to see.\n\nThree weeks. Wallet card. Three intentions. You're set.",
  "user11": "yeah. im set. \n\nthanks man.",
  "system12": "You got this.",
  "user12": "yeah. guess we'll see.",
  "system13": "That's all any of us can say. See you on the other side.",
  "user13": "yeah. see you on the other side.",
  "system14": "See you on the other side.",
  "user14": "see you there.",
  "system15": "See you there.",
  "user15": "see you there.",
  "system16": "See you there.",
  "user16": "see you there.",
  "system17": "I hear you. I\u2019m going to stay here so the channel stays clear for your return.",
  "user17": "roger that.",
