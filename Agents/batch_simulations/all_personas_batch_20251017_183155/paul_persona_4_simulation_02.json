  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_4",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know what type of medicine journey you're preparing for and where you're journeying. \n\nFor example: \"You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia\" or \"You're starting intentions onboarding for your psilocybin journey at home.\"\n\nWhat medicine are you working with and where will you be?",
  "user0": "Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks for ayahuasca. Rythmia place. Amanda thinks it'll help. I dont know.",
  "system1": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user1": "Amanda found the program. Shes at her limit with me waking up screaming every night. Says she cant take much more of this. So here I am.",
  "system2": "Night terrors every night, Amanda at her limit. That's wearing down everything that matters.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without waking her, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user2": "Maybe she'd stop looking at me like that. Like shes waiting for me to break again. Maybe I could be... I dont know. Maybe the kids wouldnt walk so quiet around me.",
  "system3": "Amanda watching you like you're fragile, kids walking quiet. They're adjusting to your edges.\n\nWhat's underneath the nightmares? What keeps replaying when you close your eyes?",
  "user3": "Look I dont want to talk about that. Can we just focus on what I need to do for this ceremony thing.",
  "system4": "Understood. We'll focus on the ceremony work.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads:\n1. Finding peace from the night terrors so Amanda can stop waiting for you to break\n2. Releasing whatever has your kids walking quiet around you\n3. Being someone your family doesn't have to tiptoe around\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry with you.",
  "user4": "Yeah. That sounds about right.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without fear\n2. I release the tension that makes my kids walk quiet in their own home  \n3. I become present and grounded with my family\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "They all sound... I dont know. Kinda soft. But yeah. The first one. About Amanda sleeping.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without fear*\n\nThe second one - \"release the tension\" - feels too soft. What would feel more like you? More direct?",
  "user6": "I guess... I want my kids to feel safe around me. Not like they gotta watch what they say or do all the time.",
  "system7": "Your kids feeling safe around you, not watching every word or move.\n\nHow does this land: *I create safety for my kids so they can be themselves in their own home*",
  "user7": "Yeah. That ones good.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I create safety for my kids so they can be themselves in their own home*\n\nOne more. The third one about being present and grounded - does that capture what you want with your family, or do you want to sharpen it?",
  "user8": "I dont know man. Maybe... I just want to be there. Really be there. Not lost in my head all the time.",
  "system9": "Really being there, not lost in your head.\n\n*I stay present with my family instead of stuck in my own head*\n\nHow's that feel?",
  "user9": "Yeah. Thats it.",
  "system10": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: *I stay present with my family instead of stuck in my own head*\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\n- Read them before bed when Amanda's getting ready to sleep\n- Keep them on your phone lock screen\n- Write them on a card in your wallet\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user10": "Phone lock screen I guess. Dont want Amanda asking questions about a card or whatever.",
  "system11": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without fear\n- I create safety for my kids so they can be themselves in their own home  \n- I stay present with my family instead of stuck in my own head\n\nYour ritual: Phone lock screen. \n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user11": "*yeah*",
  "system12": "You got what you need. That's enough for now.",
  "user12": "Yeah. Thanks.",
  "system13": "You're welcome.",
  "user13": "Night",
  "system14": "Night.",
  "user14": "*yeah*",
  "system15": "*yeah*",
  "user15": "*yeah*",
  "system16": "I hear you.",
  "user16": "dont know what im doing here anymore",
  "system17": "That\u2019s honest.  \nIf nothing\u2019s pulling you forward, we can pause\u2014no need to force a direction.  \nWant to sit with that blank space, or is there something still itching underneath?",
  "user17": "just tired of waking her up every night. thats all.",
  "system18": "Night after night of her getting jolted awake\u2014exhausting for both of you.\n\nWhen you picture her sleeping through the night beside you, what feels most important to protect or reclaim?",
  "user18": "i just want her to feel safe in her own house.",
  "system19": "Safe in her own house\u2014clear anchor.\n\nWhat\u2019s the main thing that keeps breaking that sense of safety right now: the noise, the way you wake up, or something else?",
  "user19": "the way i wake up. screaming about the cockpit."
