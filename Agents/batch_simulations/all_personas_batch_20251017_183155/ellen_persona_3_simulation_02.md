## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

---

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know what type of medicine journey you're preparing for and where you're doing this work. This helps me tailor the intentions to your specific context.

What medicine are you working with, and where's your journey taking place?


**ellen_persona_3**: I'm heading to Beond in Cancun this winter for Ibogaine. I've worked with ayahuasca, psilocybin, and MDMA before, but this feels... different. Heavier, maybe. Like it's going to demand more from me than the others did.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're heading to Beond for Ibogaine this winter. You've done the deep work before, but you're right - Ibogaine carries a different weight. It's not gentle like ayahuasca or warm like MDMA. It strips things down to the bone.

What brought you to Ibogaine specifically? What's calling you to this particular medicine now?


**ellen_persona_3**: I keep thinking about what my grandmother used to say - that we carry our ancestors' unfinished business in our bones. The other medicines showed me glimpses of what I'm missing, but... I don't know. It's like I've been collecting pieces of a puzzle without knowing what the picture's supposed to be.

The ayahuasca showed me those ancestral women calling me to weave connections. The psilocybin gave me back my joy in nature. The MDMA helped me drop the armor. But I'm still... fragmented. Still jumping from board meeting to kids' soccer games to meditation cushion like I'm playing different roles in different movies.

Ibogaine feels like it might force me to stop performing and just... be still with whatever's underneath all that achievement. My grandmother had this quiet faith that sustained her through real hardship. I want to know if there's something like that in me, or if I've traded it all away for a successful exit.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your grandmother's wisdom about carrying unfinished business in your bones - that's real. And you're right, Ibogaine doesn't let you keep performing. It'll strip away those roles you've been juggling.

When you imagine dropping all the achievement and just sitting with whatever's underneath, what scares you most about what you might find there?


**ellen_persona_3**: That there might be nothing there. That underneath all the startups and exits and board seats, I'm just... hollow. Like I've been so busy building companies that I forgot to build an actual self.

My kids were playing at the park last weekend - just this simple moment with them on the swings - and I felt more real than I have in months. But then I caught myself thinking about how to optimize that feeling, how to bottle it, how to make it repeatable. Even my spirituality became another achievement metric.

What if I've become one of those people my grandmother warned me about - successful on the outside but spiritually bankrupt? What if I find out that all those ancestral women from my ayahuasca visions were just... disappointed in what I've become?


**intentions_workflow_3**: That hollowness you're afraid of - that's the real fear. Not death or pain, but discovering you've built everything except a self.

Your grandmother's warning about spiritual bankruptcy lands different when you've actually lived it. And those ancestral women from your visions - if they're disappointed, it's not in who you are, but in how distant you've become from what matters.

What's the cost of staying hollow? What happens if you don't do this work?


**ellen_persona_3**: Then I keep showing up to board meetings and pretending I care about quarterly projections. Keep checking boxes for my kids - homework, soccer practice, weekend activities - while secretly scrolling through work emails. Keep building companies that solve problems I don't actually care about.

My daughter asked me last week what I wanted to be when I was her age. I told her I wanted to be a doctor, because that's what successful Jewish girls said. She looked at me like I'd just spoken in another language. "But what did you *want*, Mommy?" And I couldn't answer because I don't remember ever asking myself that question.

If I don't do this work, I become my grandmother's cautionary tale. The one who had every opportunity and used none of them to find her way home. Who dies with a full calendar and an empty soul.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your daughter's question cut through everything - "what did you *want*?" Not what you were supposed to want, not what would look good, but what you actually wanted before the performance started.

Three main threads here:

1. Finding what's real underneath all the achievement - discovering if there's an actual self beneath the hollow success
2. Reconnecting with that authentic desire your daughter sensed was missing - learning to want again
3. Breaking the pattern of your grandmother's cautionary tale - not dying with opportunities unused

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah, that captures it. Though it's... I don't know, embarrassing to admit I need intentions around learning how to want again. Most people figure that out by kindergarten.

But those three - they're real. Especially that last one about not becoming the cautionary tale. My grandmother lived through real hardship and still found her way to something meaningful. I've had every privilege and I'm still lost.

So how do I turn these into something I can actually hold onto during the Ibogaine? Something stronger than just "figure out what I want to be when I grow up" - which feels pathetic for someone who's already had a successful exit.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I discover what exists beneath my achievements - the self that remains when performance ends
2. I reclaim my capacity to want from my own heart, not from what looks successful
3. I break the ancestral pattern of dying with opportunities unlived

The embarrassment about needing to learn to want again - that's part of the armor. Kids know what they want until we train it out of them.

Which intention speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to make it more yours?


**ellen_persona_3**: The third one hits hardest - about breaking that pattern. But I need it stronger. Less... I don't know, therapeutic and more like a command.

How about: "I end the generational cowardice with me. My grandmother survived hardship to find meaning. My job is to stop running from the hard questions and actually live the answers."

And the first one needs to be more direct too. "Strip away everything I've built and show me what - if anything - is actually here."

The wanting one... that one's trickier. Maybe: "Find the part of me that still knows how to want without calculating the ROI on desire."

Too harsh?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I end the generational cowardice with me. My grandmother survived hardship to find meaning. My job is to stop running from the hard questions and actually live the answers."

That shift from "break the pattern" to "end the generational cowardice" - that's your voice. No more running.

How about these refinements:

1. "Strip away everything I've built and reveal what - if anything - is actually here"
2. "Find the part of me that still knows how to want without calculating the ROI on desire"

The first one's cleaner - "reveal" instead of "show me" feels more like you're ready to face whatever's there. The second one captures that calculation piece perfectly.

How do these land?


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah, these feel like mine. Not therapy-speak, not something I'd put on a vision board, but something I can grip when the medicine gets rough.

"Reveal" is better. More surgical. Like I'm ready to cut through my own bullshit instead of waiting for some cosmic teacher to show me.

And that ROI line - that's exactly it. I've been treating my own desires like due diligence on a startup. "What's the market size on joy? What's the exit strategy for authenticity?"

These three feel like something I can carry into the dark with me. My grandmother would probably hate the language, but she'd recognize the fight in it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "Strip away everything I've built and reveal what - if anything - is actually here"

✓ Intention 2 locked in: "Find the part of me that still knows how to want without calculating the ROI on desire"

Your grandmother would recognize that fight - the same steel that got her through whatever she faced. Different language, same refusal to stay hollow.

You've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:

Write them on a card you keep with your grandmother's photo
Read them before morning meditation
Keep them in your phone's notes app

What would help you hold these when the medicine gets rough?


**ellen_persona_3**: I'll write them on the back of my grandmother's photo - the one from her naturalization ceremony where she's wearing that terrible brown suit but looking like she could take on the whole damn country. That's the version of her I need. The one who survived pogroms and came here with nothing and still found a way to pray every morning.

My daughter keeps asking about her great-grandmother. Maybe after this journey, I'll have something real to tell her instead of just the sanitized version about how she worked hard and built a good life.

The photo goes in my wallet. Been carrying that thing for twenty years through every deal, every exit, every board meeting. Seems right to keep these intentions close too.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Perfect. That photo already carries everything you need - her fight, her survival, her prayers. Now it carries your intentions too.

Your three intentions for this journey:
- Strip away everything I've built and reveal what - if anything - is actually here
- Find the part of me that still knows how to want without calculating the ROI on desire
- I end the generational cowardice with me. My grandmother survived hardship to find meaning. My job is to stop running from the hard questions and actually live the answers

Your ritual: Write them on the back of your grandmother's naturalization photo, keep it in your wallet with her through every deal and exit to come.

These are your compass, not your destination. The Ibogaine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**ellen_persona_3**: Three weeks. With these words and her face looking back at me through whatever's coming.

The funny thing is, I think she'd approve. Even if she wouldn't understand the medicine or the language, she'd recognize that I'm finally picking up what she was trying to put down. The part about not running from the hard questions - that's what she was really teaching all those years, not just how to make a good life, but how to make a *real* one.

Thanks for helping me find the words that feel like mine.


**intentions_workflow_3**: She'd recognize that you're finally picking up what she was putting down. That's exactly it. The medicine, the language - that's just the vehicle. The real teaching was always about facing the hard questions instead of running.

You've got the words that feel like yours now. Trust them when things get rough in there.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will. When it gets dark and I'm wondering why the hell I thought this was a good idea, I'll remember these aren't someone else's affirmations - they're my own voice, just clearer than I usually let it be.

Thanks for helping me find that.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly. When it gets dark, you'll hear your own voice saying things you already know but don't usually let yourself say out loud.

Trust that voice.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will. It's been a long time since I trusted anything that wasn't data-driven or peer-reviewed, but this feels different. More solid than any business plan I ever wrote.

See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_3**: See you on the other side.


**ellen_persona_3**: See you then.


**intentions_workflow_3**: See you then.


**ellen_persona_3**: Looking forward to hearing how it goes. Safe travels, Ellen.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Safe travels, Ellen.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thank you. For everything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're welcome, Ellen.


**ellen_persona_3**: Take care.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You too.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thanks.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your upcoming journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For this medicine work, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**ellen_persona_3**: I guess... I've been feeling like I'm living someone else's life. Like I'm still performing the role of successful entrepreneur even though I sold my company years ago. The ibogaine feels like my last real shot at figuring out who I am without all the achievements.

My grandmother used to say I was chasing shadows. She'd probably laugh that it took me this long to see it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Living someone else's life long after the exit - that's a particular kind of empty. Your grandmother saw it clearly.

What would it feel like to stop performing and just be? What part of you is underneath all those achievements?


**ellen_persona_3**: I don't know if I even remember how to just be anymore. When I sold the company, everyone expected me to feel... triumphant, I guess. Instead I felt hollow, like I'd been so focused on the next milestone that I forgot to build an actual life underneath it.

Sometimes when I'm hiking with the kids, I'll catch glimpses of her - that girl who used to lie in the grass for hours, totally content. Back when success meant joy, not numbers on a spreadsheet.

The sad thing is, I'm terrified that woman doesn't exist anymore. That I optimized her right out of existence.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That girl who lay in grass for hours - she's still in there. The terror she might be gone tells me she's not.

When you're hiking with your kids and catch those glimpses, what does that feel like in your body? What part of you recognizes her?


**ellen_persona_3**: It's... like this warmth spreading across my chest. My shoulders drop - I hadn't even realized how tight I hold them all day. And suddenly I can breathe deeper, like I've been taking shallow breaths for years without noticing.

The kids will point out a cool bug or ask me to race them to that tree up ahead, and for a second I forget about checking my phone or thinking about the next board meeting. It's just... easy. Natural.

My grandmother used to call it "being in right time." Said it was how we were meant to live, not rushing ahead or dwelling behind. I think that's what recognizes her - this part of me that remembers how to exist without an agenda.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That warmth, shoulders dropping, breathing deeper - your body remembers how to be real. "Right time" - your grandmother knew what mattered.

I'm hearing three threads:
- Finding who you are beyond the performer/achiever identity
- Reconnecting with that girl who lived without an agenda
- Learning to trust that natural, easy way of being again

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah, that feels right. I need to... not lose those threads when I'm back in the real world. When the emails start piling up and everyone wants something from me again.

Sometimes I think about just canceling everything. Going off-grid like some people do after these experiences. But then I remember the kids need me, and honestly - I don't think running away is the answer either.

I need to figure out how to bring that "right time" feeling into my actual life. Not just on hikes or retreats.
