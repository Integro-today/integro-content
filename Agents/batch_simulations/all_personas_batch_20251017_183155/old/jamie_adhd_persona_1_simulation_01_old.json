  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "jamie_adhd_persona_1",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know more about your journey to help you craft meaningful intentions. \n\nWhat medicine are you working with, and where are you in your process?",
  "user0": "Got into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks for ayahuasca. Amanda thinks this'll fix everything. I dont know man. Never done any of this stuff before.",
  "system1": "You're heading to Costa Rica in three weeks for ayahuasca - first timer with Amanda's hopes riding on it.\n\nHeroic Hearts works with veterans, right? What's got you seeking this particular path after everything else?",
  "user1": "Yeah they're all vets. Thats why I applied. Figured they wouldnt judge me for... whatever this is.\n\nAmanda found the program. Said shes at her limit with the nightmares. I tried everything else. VA therapy was useless. This is the last thing before she leaves I guess.",
  "system2": "Amanda's at her limit with the nightmares, and this is the last stop before she walks. That lands heavy.\n\nWhat happens during these nightmares? What's your body doing that has her sleeping on the couch?",
  "user2": "Wake up shouting about the cockpit alarms. Sometimes I'm grabbing the sheets like I'm still flying. Sweating through everything. \n\nShe started sleeping in the guest room most nights. Says she cant take it anymore.",
  "system3": "Cockpit alarms, grabbing sheets, sweating - your body thinks it's still flying missions while you're in bed.\n\nBeyond just stopping the nightmares, what do you want your nights to feel like? What would have Amanda staying in bed with you?",
  "user3": "Just want to sleep through the night. Not wake her up. Not scare her anymore.\n\nIf I could just... lay there. Quiet. Like a normal person.",
  "system4": "Sleep through the night without waking her - just lay there quiet like a regular person.\n\nWhen you imagine that quiet sleep, what changes beyond just the noise? What would Amanda notice different about who you are during the day?",
  "user4": "Maybe I wouldnt snap at the kids over nothing. Maybe dinner wouldnt be so tense. \n\nMichael Jr might actually talk to me again instead of walking on eggshells.",
  "system5": "Quiet nights, kids stop walking on eggshells, dinner without tension - Michael Jr talking to you again.\n\nWhat's underneath the snapping? What are the kids hitting that makes you react before you can stop yourself?",
  "user5": "I dont know. Its like... everything's too loud. Too much. They leave dishes out or Sarahs bouncing around and I just... cant handle it. \n\nLike my nerves are already shot before the day even starts.",
  "system6": "Everything's too loud, nerves already shot - the normal kid stuff sends you over the edge.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to handle the dishes and bouncing without that shot feeling? What would Amanda see different?",
  "user6": "I dont even know what that would feel like anymore. \n\nMaybe... like I could breathe? Not feel this thing sitting on my chest all the time.",
  "system7": "Like you could breathe without that weight on your chest - that's what's missing.\n\nThree threads here:\n1. Finding peaceful sleep so you and Amanda share a bed again\n2. Releasing that pressure on your chest so you can breathe through the day\n3. Being present with your kids without the overreactions\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user7": "Yeah. Those three things. Thats it.",
  "system8": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I release the weight on my chest so I can breathe through each day\n3. I embrace being present with my kids without everything feeling too loud\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user8": "Number two. The breathing one. \n\nBut... can we say it normal? Not all this \"I welcome\" stuff.",
  "system9": "\u2713 Intention 2: \"I can breathe without the weight on my chest\"\n\nThat's your voice - direct, no fluff.\n\nHow about the other two? Want those in plain language too?",
  "user9": "Yeah. Just say it straight.\n\nSleep through the night without waking Amanda up. Be able to handle the kids being loud without losing it.",
  "system10": "\u2713 Intention 1: Sleep through the night without waking Amanda up  \n\u2713 Intention 3: Handle the kids being loud without losing it\n\nThree solid intentions:\n1. Sleep through the night without waking Amanda up\n2. I can breathe without the weight on my chest\n3. Handle the kids being loud without losing it\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Write them on a card? Keep them in your wallet or somewhere you'll see them?",
  "user10": "Yeah a card. Keep it simple. \n\nMaybe in my wallet with my license. I look at that every morning anyway.",
  "system11": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- Sleep through the night without waking Amanda up\n- I can breathe without the weight on my chest  \n- Handle the kids being loud without losing it\n\nYour ritual: Card in your wallet with your license. You'll see them every morning.\n\nThree clear intentions. You're set. Trust what emerges.",
  "user11": "Alright. Got it.",
  "system12": "Good. You\u2019ve got your compass\u2014clear, simple, yours. Hold them and let the medicine do its work.",
  "user12": "Yeah. We'll see what happens.",
  "system13": "That\u2019s the work now\u2014hold the intentions and see what shows up. You\u2019re ready.",
