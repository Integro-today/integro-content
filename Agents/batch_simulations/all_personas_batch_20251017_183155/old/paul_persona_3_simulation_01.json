  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know what type of medicine journey you're preparing for and where you're doing this work before we begin.\n\nWhat's your medicine and where are you journeying?",
  "user0": "Ayahuasca. Going to Rythmia in Costa Rica in three weeks. Heroic Hearts Project set it up. I don't know much about this plant stuff but... well, Amanda says I need to try something different. Can't keep waking up the way I do.",
  "system1": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user1": "Amanda. She says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. Hate that I'm doing that to her. Figure this is... I don't know, maybe my last shot at not losing her. Heroic Hearts thinks this plant medicine can help me sleep better, stop the nightmares. I don't buy it, but I'm here.",
  "system2": "Amanda's scared when you wake up shouting. You hate what that's doing to her, and you're here as maybe your last shot at not losing her.\n\nWhen you wake up shouting - what's happening in those moments? What are you seeing or feeling?",
  "user2": "It's... I don't know. Just dreams. Same ones over and over - I'm back there, cockpit alarms going off, trying to... trying to get to someone but I can't. Always too late. Sometimes it's my wingman, sometimes... sometimes it's Amanda or the kids. Wake up with my heart pounding like I ran a marathon, can't breathe. Sheets soaked through. Takes me a minute to remember where I am.",
  "system3": "Back in the cockpit, alarms screaming, always too late to reach them. Your heart pounding like you just ran out of there, body soaked, taking a minute to remember you're home.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without these dreams, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user3": "Maybe... maybe Amanda wouldn't look at me like that anymore. Like she's waiting for me to break. Maybe I could sit through a whole dinner without feeling like I need to jump out of my own skin. Maybe the kids... maybe they wouldn't flinch when I raise my voice about homework. I just want to be the man they think I am, not... not whatever this is.",
  "system4": "Amanda wouldn't look at you like you're about to shatter. You could sit through dinner without needing to escape your own skin. The kids wouldn't flinch when you speak.\n\nWhat's underneath needing to jump out of your skin? What's your body still protecting you from?",
  "user4": "I... I don't know how to say this without sounding... Look, I did what I had to do over there. Made choices. Watched people not make it back. That stays with you. My body just... it won't shut off. Like I'm still waiting for the next threat, next thing I gotta handle. Only there ain't nothing to handle here except mortgage payments and softball practice. Don't make sense.",
  "system5": "You made choices over there, watched people not make it back. Now your body won't shut off, still waiting for threats that don't exist here - just mortgage payments and softball practice.\n\nThree main threads here:\n\n1. Finding peace from the nightmares so Amanda stops looking at you like you're about to break\n2. Teaching your body it's home now, not still back there waiting for threats\n3. Being present with your kids without them flinching when you speak\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's it. I just want to sleep without drowning in it. Want to look at Amanda without seeing that fear in her eyes. Want my kids to feel safe around me. Don't need to be some... I don't know, some enlightened whatever. Just need to stop carrying this weight into every room I walk into.",
  "system6": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams\n2. I release the hypervigilance and trust I'm home now, not back there\n3. I become the steady father my kids can feel safe around\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user6": "The first one hits hardest. \"I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams\" - that's it. That's what I need.\n\nBut the second one... \"hypervigilance\" sounds like something from a textbook. What about \"I release this constant edge and trust I'm home now, not back there\"?\n\nThird one feels right too. Just... maybe \"I become the steady father my kids deserve\" instead?",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I release this constant edge and trust I'm home now, not back there\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I become the steady father my kids deserve\"\n\nYou've got your three intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\nWrite them on a card in your wallet\nRead them during morning PT\nKeep them where you keep your dog tags\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user7": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too. Maybe read 'em when I'm out running. Early morning, just me and the road... that's when I can think clearest anyway.",
  "system8": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n- I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams\n- I release this constant edge and trust I'm home now, not back there  \n- I become the steady father my kids deserve\n\nYour ritual: Keep the card in your wallet, read them on early morning runs. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Three weeks. I'll... I'll be ready. Been through worse than this plant stuff, right? Just need to keep these close and... see what happens. Whatever it takes to stop losing Amanda.",
  "system9": "You've been through worse than plant medicine. Keep these intentions close on your runs, see what emerges. Whatever it takes to stop losing Amanda - that's what you're carrying with you.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user9": "I will. Just... don't tell anyone about this, alright? About the nightmares, the fear. I got people who think I'm the rock, the one who held it together. Let 'em keep thinking that. This is just between us, the medicine, and whatever's out there.",
  "system10": "This stays between us. You're the rock for others - that doesn't have to break here. The medicine, your intentions, and whatever's out there - that's your business alone.\n\nYou're set. Trust what emerges.",
  "user10": "Good. That's good. I just... I need to do this right. Can't mess it up. Too much riding on it.",
  "system11": "Doing it right means showing up with these intentions you've built. That's all you control. The medicine handles the rest.\n\nYou've got your compass. That's enough.",
  "user11": "Right. Yeah. Just show up and... trust the process. I can do that. Done harder things than this.",
  "system12": "Exactly. You've done harder things than this. Show up with your intentions, let the medicine do its work.\n\nThree weeks. You're ready.",
  "user12": "Three weeks. Then maybe I can finally sleep through the night without waking up screaming. Maybe Amanda won't look at me like I'm a stranger anymore. Maybe... maybe I can be who they need me to be again.",
  "system13": "Three weeks. Hold that maybe close - sleep through the night, Amanda beside you, being who they need. Your intentions are set for exactly that.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user13": "I will. I\u2019m ready to meet whatever\u2019s waiting out there.",
  "system14": "Good. Meet it with your intentions steady in your pocket. You've done the work\u2014now let the medicine meet you halfway.",
  "user14": "Halfway\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever needed. Thanks for walking this stretch with me.",
  "system15": "Halfway\u2019s all it takes. You walked your own road\u2014I just held the map for a minute.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user15": "See you there.",
  "system16": "You\u2019ve got this.",
