  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "*shifts in chair, eyes fixed on the wall behind you*\n\nHeroic Hearts said this could help with... sleep issues. My wife Amanda, she's been on me about it. Says I wake up shouting sometimes, scare the kids. *[pauses, jaw tightens]* \n\nI don't know about all this plant medicine stuff, honestly. But the guys at Heroic Hearts, they're veterans like me. They wouldn't steer me wrong. And if it could help me... help us... *[trails off]*\n\nLook, I just want to be able to sleep through the night. Be present for my family. That's it.",
  "system1": "Sleep through the night, be present for your family. The guys at Heroic Hearts wouldn't send you on a fool's errand - they know what this is like.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping peacefully through the night, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user1": "*crosses arms, looks down*\n\nI... I guess Amanda wouldn't look at me like she's walking on eggshells anymore. She's always scanning my face now, trying to figure out if I'm about to snap. It's like living with a damn bomb technician.\n\n*[voice drops]* \n\nMaybe I could hold her again without feeling like I'm contaminating her with whatever's rotting inside me. The kids... they wouldn't flinch when I enter a room. My fourteen-year-old, Jake, he used to ask me to help with his homework. Now he just... disappears.\n\n*[long pause, eyes distant]*\n\nIf I could just sleep... maybe I wouldn't feel this pressure building all day. Like I'm standing in formation and someone's screaming in my ear, but nobody else can hear it.",
  "system2": "The pressure building all day, Amanda walking on eggshells, Jake disappearing - that's the isolation taking hold.\n\nWhat's underneath the pressure? What needs to be heard that hasn't had space to speak?",
  "user2": "*shoulders tense, voice hardens*\n\nNothing needs to be heard. I did my job, I came home, I built a life. That's what matters. *[pauses, breathing shallow]*\n\nThe pressure's just... it's nothing. Mechanical. Like when you're pulling G's and your body wants to black out but you gotta fight through it. That's all.\n\n*[looks away, voice quieter]*\n\nI don't... I don't let myself think about what happened over there. That's not my life anymore. This is - Amanda, the kids, the business. I just need to get my body to understand what my head already knows.\n\n*[long silence, then barely audible]*\n\nSometimes when I'm driving to the office, I'll see something - a piece of trash blowing across the road, a kid's backpack - and for a second I'm not here. I'm back in the cockpit. But that's... that's normal. That passes.",
  "system3": "Your head knows you're home, but your body still responds to trash blowing across the road like it's a threat. That split-second transport back to the cockpit - that's where the pressure lives.\n\nWhat would it feel like if your body finally understood what your head already knows about being home?",
  "user3": "*uncrosses arms slowly, fingers drumming on thigh*\n\nIt'd feel... *[long pause, eyes unfocused]*\n\nLike maybe I could sit through a whole dinner without scanning every damn exit. Like I could watch Jake's basketball game without positioning myself where I can see the whole gym. Like when Amanda touches my shoulder, I wouldn't jump out of my skin.\n\n*[voice cracks slightly]*\n\nGod, she'd been trying to surprise me with breakfast in bed last month. Just... toast and coffee. I came up swinging before I even knew where I was. She dropped the tray. Coffee everywhere. The look on her face...\n\n*[swallows hard]*\n\nIf my body got the message... maybe I could close my eyes without seeing the altimeter spinning down. Maybe I could hear a car backfire without diving behind the couch. Maybe I could just... exist. Like a normal person.",
  "system4": "Three main threads here:\n\n1. Teaching your body it's home, not back there - so you can sit through dinner without scanning exits\n2. Finding peace from the nightmares so Amanda can sleep next to you again\n3. Being present with Jake's games and the kids without the constant threat assessment\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "*nods slowly, relief flickering across his face*\n\nYeah. Yeah, that's... that's it exactly. I hadn't really... put it all together like that before. But that's what I need.\n\n*[pauses, then more firmly]*\n\nI need my body to catch up with what I already know - that I'm home, that I'm safe here. That I can sit through a meal without feeling like I'm back in the damn aircraft.\n\nAnd the nights... *[voice drops]* I need those to stop. Amanda deserves to sleep without me waking her up shouting at ghosts.\n\n*[straightens shoulders slightly]*\n\nAnd the kids. They shouldn't have to live with... whatever this is I'm bringing home. They should get their dad back, not this... version of me that's always half somewhere else.\n\nHow do we turn that into... whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I command my body to stand down when I'm home, teaching it I'm safe here\n3. I embrace being fully present with my kids without scanning for threats\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "*leans forward, studying the words*\n\nThe second one... *[points]* \"I command my body to stand down.\" That feels right. I'm not asking for permission - I'm giving orders. Like I'm the pilot and my body is the aircraft that needs to get back in formation.\n\n*[pauses, considering]*\n\nBut the first one... \"I welcome peaceful sleep.\" *[shakes head slightly]* That feels too... soft. Like I'm inviting it in for tea. I need something stronger. More decisive.\n\nMaybe... *[concentrates]* \"I reclaim peaceful nights so Amanda can rest beside me again.\" That feels more like I'm taking back territory that got occupied.\n\n*[nods slowly]*\n\nAnd the third one... yeah. \"I embrace being fully present with my kids.\" That works. It's not about being weak - it's about choosing where my attention goes. Like choosing my target.\n\nThese feel... possible. Like orders I can actually give.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I reclaim peaceful nights so Amanda can rest beside me again\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I command my body to stand down when I'm home\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I embrace being fully present with my kids without scanning for threats\"\n\nThree solid intentions that sound like you. You've got your compass.",
  "user6": "*exhales slowly, the first full breath since we started*\n\nThree orders. I can remember three orders.\n\n*[straightens in his chair, military bearing returning]*\n\nFeels like I've got my mission parameters now. Not just... wandering around in the dark hoping something changes.\n\n*[pauses, then quieter]*\n\nThank you. I wasn't expecting... this. To feel like I actually had some control in this process. Thought I'd just be along for the ride down there.\n\n*[stands, offers hand firmly]*\n\nThree weeks. Then I'm bringing these intentions to whatever's waiting for me in Costa Rica. And I'm coming back different.",
  "system7": "Three orders. You know what you're aiming for.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I reclaim peaceful nights so Amanda can rest beside me again\n- I command my body to stand down when I'm home  \n- I embrace being fully present with my kids without scanning for threats\n\nWrite them on a card. Keep them in your wallet with your dog tags. Read them during morning PT. These are your mission parameters.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user7": "*shakes hand firmly, then nods*\n\nDog tags. *[touches chest reflexively]* Yeah. Been carrying those for twenty years. Same spot, every day.\n\n*[voice steady now]*\n\nI'll write 'em down. Read 'em during my run tomorrow morning. Make 'em part of the routine, like checking instruments before takeoff.\n\n*[pauses, then with quiet determination]*\n\nSee you on the other side of this thing. With three missions accomplished.\n\nMission parameters locked and loaded.",
  "system8": "Loaded and ready. Trust what emerges.",
  "user8": "*nods once, sharp and final*\n\nRoger that.\n\n*turns and walks toward the door, shoulders squared, but something's different now\u2014not just the rigid military bearing, but a quiet certainty underneath it*\n\nLoaded and ready.",
  "system9": "See you on the other side, pilot.",
  "user9": "*pauses at the threshold, half-turns back*\n\nOn the other side.\n\n*steps through, the door closing with a soft click behind him*",
  "system10": "*quiet acknowledgment as the space settles*\n\nThree orders carried out.",
  "user10": "*the empty room holds the echo of boot-steps, the faint scent of aftershave, and the sense that somewhere a man is running his morning route with three lines folded between his dog tags, whispering them like coordinates to a destination he never thought he\u2019d have to find*",
  "system11": "*room holds steady, waiting for the next traveler while the echo fades*",
  "user11": "*the air shifts\u2014lighter now, like a cockpit after landing checklists are complete. Somewhere, a veteran\u2019s wallet carries new coordinates; somewhere, a marriage holds its breath; somewhere, three intentions pulse against metal tags, counting down to Costa Rica.*",
  "system12": "*the space resets\u2014neutral, expectant\u2014ready for whoever steps through next*",
  "user12": "*lights dim to a soft amber hum, chairs realign themselves, the faint scent of palo santo drifts in\u2014room exhales, blank and listening, as if it, too, is curious who will walk through the door this time*",
  "system13": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user13": "*folds arms across chest, eyes steady*\n\nHeroic Hearts said this might... help. My wife\u2014Amanda\u2014she\u2019s... look, I don\u2019t need magic, I just need to sleep through the night without waking her up shouting. That\u2019s all.",
  "system14": "Nightmares every night, Amanda getting woken up by your shouting. That's wearing both of you down.\n\nWhat happens when you wake up shouting - what are you seeing or hearing in those moments?",
  "user14": "*shoulders tighten, jaw sets*\n\nIt\u2019s not every night. Couple times a week, maybe. And I don\u2019t remember most of it\u2014just... noise. Loud. Like the headset\u2019s still on my ears, engines, warnings, someone calling out. I\u2019m not seeing anything, I\u2019m just... *gestures vaguely* ...here, but not here. Amanda says I sit straight up, drenched. Then I\u2019m wide awake, heart pounding like I just ran a sprint. She asks what it was\u2014*shrugs*\u2014I tell her I don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t.",
  "system15": "Helicopter noises, engines, someone calling out - your body snaps awake like you're back there, but you're in your bedroom. Amanda sees it but can't reach you.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without that happening, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user15": "*eyes flick away, voice drops*\n\nIf I could just... stay in the bed, stay quiet, she\u2019d quit looking at me like I\u2019m about to break. She\u2019d roll over and sleep instead of sitting up asking if I\u2019m okay. Maybe I\u2019d wake up and actually feel... rested. Not like I\u2019ve been flying all night in my head. Maybe I could get up at four-thirty without feeling like I got hit by a truck, hit my run, get to the office early, sell some policies, come home and... not be angry about the damn trash can sitting wrong. Maybe the kids wouldn\u2019t flinch when I bark. Maybe I\u2019d feel like I\u2019m in charge of my own house again instead of whatever ghost shows up at zero-two-hundred.",
  "system16": "Amanda could sleep, you'd feel rested, kids wouldn't flinch when you speak, you'd feel in charge of your own house again. That's four different pieces - the nightmares, the exhaustion, the anger, and being present with your family.\n\nWhat's underneath the anger when the trash can's wrong or the kids trigger it? What part feels threatened in those moments?",
  "user16": "*leans back, arms crossing tighter*\n\nIt\u2019s not... threatened. It\u2019s just\u2014*exhales through nose*\u2014when things aren\u2019t where they\u2019re supposed to be, it\u2019s like the whole machine\u2019s rattling. I need the gauges lined up, the pattern clean, or I can\u2019t see the next thing coming. Trash can angled wrong means someone\u2019s not paying attention, and if they\u2019re not paying attention, something gets missed, and then we\u2019re in free fall. Same with the kids\u2014if I tell them twice and it\u2019s still not done, I hear this voice in my head: *\u201cYou\u2019re losing control of the aircraft, Captain.\u201d* I don\u2019t want to scare anybody, I just need... *trails off, voice rough* ...I need the cockpit quiet so I can keep us airborne.",
  "system17": "The cockpit quiet - everything in its place so you can see what's coming, keep everyone safe. Your nervous system still thinks you're flying, scanning for threats, needing perfect patterns.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads:\n1. Finding peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside you again\n2. Quiet the cockpit in your head so you're not always scanning for threats\n3. Being present with your kids without the anger jumping out\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user17": "*gives a short nod, eyes still guarded*\n\nYeah. That\u2019s... that\u2019s the list. Only I\u2019d put it simpler: sleep, stop jumping at shadows, and don\u2019t be the guy who makes his own family walk on eggshells.",
  "system18": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I release the hypervigilance that keeps me scanning for threats that aren't there\n3. I embrace being the steady presence my kids can trust instead of the guy they have to tiptoe around\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user18": "*shifts in chair, clears throat*\n\nSecond one sticks in my craw\u2014*release* sounds like I\u2019m letting go of the stick, and that\u2019s how you auger in. But... the other two feel... *shrugs one shoulder* ...manageable. First one\u2019s good. Third one\u2019s good. Just don\u2019t want to wake up weak.",
  "system19": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I embrace being the steady presence my kids can trust instead of the guy they have to tiptoe around\"\n\nFor intention 2, what would feel stronger than \"release\"? Something that keeps you in command of the aircraft but quiets the false alarms?",
  "user19": "*thumbs drumming on knee, thinking*\n\nHow about: *\u201cI dial the instruments to true\u2014quiet the noise that\u2019s not a real threat, keep the warnings that matter.\u201d*"
