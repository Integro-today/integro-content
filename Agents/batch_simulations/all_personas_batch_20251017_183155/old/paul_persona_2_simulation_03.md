## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_2**: Heroic Hearts accepted me into their program. Three weeks in Costa Rica, some kind of plant medicine thing. 

Amanda—my wife—she thinks it'll help. Says I wake up shouting too much. Scares her. I don't know what I expect from it, but twenty years of marriage... you try things when someone's telling you they're afraid of you.

I don't buy into all this spiritual stuff, but the guys running it seem solid. Veterans helping veterans. Figured I've got nothing left to lose.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Twenty years of marriage - when Amanda's scared of you, that's worth listening to. Veterans helping veterans has weight.

Nightmares that make her sleep on the couch. Twenty years of this.

What happens in those moments when you wake up shouting? What are you back in?


**paul_persona_2**: I don't... I mean, it's not like I'm reliving anything specific. Just dreams where I'm flying, but something's wrong with the plane. Instruments are failing, can't see the runway, people screaming in the back. Sometimes it's the mountains rushing up at me. Sometimes I'm dropping flares and they're not working.

I don't know why I shout. Amanda says it's like I'm giving orders, calling out coordinates. She says I sound... desperate. I hate that word.

It's not PTSD. Guys with PTSD can't function. I run my business, I provide for my family. I just need to sleep through the night.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Flying dreams where everything's failing - instruments, flares, people screaming. You're calling out coordinates while mountains rush up. Desperate.

You run your business, provide for your family. But Amanda's on the couch instead of next to you.

What would sleeping through the night change? Beyond just the sleep itself?


**paul_persona_2**: She'd... she'd stay in our bed. Twenty years, and we're like roommates half the time now. She tiptoes around the house like I'm some bomb that might go off.

If I could just sleep... maybe I'd stop snapping at the kids for nothing. Maybe I could hear myself think without this constant hum in my chest. Maybe Amanda would look at me the way she used to, before she started checking the locks twice and keeping her phone close.

I want to be the man she married. Not whatever this is that's taken over my body at night.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three threads here:

1. Getting Amanda back in your bed - ending the twenty years of her sleeping on the couch, checking locks twice
2. Quieting that constant hum in your chest so you can think straight and stop snapping at the kids
3. Reclaiming the man she married instead of whatever's hijacked your body at night

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_2**: Yeah. That... that's about right.

I need to get back to being me. The guy who could handle problems without losing his temper. The guy Amanda trusted enough to fall asleep next to. The guy my kids deserve.

I don't know how this plant stuff works, but if it can help me stop being this version of myself... I'll try anything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can share our bed again
2. I release the constant tension in my chest so I can think clearly and be patient with my kids
3. I reclaim the steady man Amanda trusted enough to fall asleep next to

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to sound more like you?


**paul_persona_2**: The bed one... that hits home. It's been too many nights watching her walk out with her pillow.

And the steady man part. Yeah. I used to be the one everyone counted on to stay calm when things went sideways. Now I'm the one going sideways.

I don't know about the "I welcome" and "I release" parts though. Sounds like something from those self-help books Amanda reads. Can we make it more... I don't know, direct? Like I'm giving orders to the medicine instead of asking it nicely?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night so Amanda stays in our bed

How about: I reclaim the steady man who handled crises without losing his shit

What's the direct version of telling that constant hum in your chest to stand down?


**paul_persona_2**: I shut down the noise in my head so I can see straight and keep my hands steady.

That's how I'd say it. Like I'm briefing myself before a mission. Clear, direct. No room for interpretation.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: I shut down the noise in my head so I can see straight and keep my hands steady

✓ Intention 3 locked in: I reclaim the steady man who handled crises without losing his shit

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I sleep through the night so Amanda stays in our bed
- I shut down the noise in my head so I can see straight and keep my hands steady  
- I reclaim the steady man who handled crises without losing my shit

How do you want to keep these close? Brief yourself with them before the ceremony? Write them in your flight log?


**paul_persona_2**: Yeah, I'll write them down. Keep them in my flight log with my other mission notes—been carrying that thing for twenty years. Seems right to keep these intentions there too.

Brief myself before the ceremony. Like a pre-flight checklist. Read them out loud, make sure I'm clear on the mission parameters.

This feels... different than anything I've done before. But if it helps me get back to being the man I was supposed to be...


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions in your flight log. Pre-flight checklist before the ceremony.

Your ritual: Read them out loud like mission parameters, keep them in the log you've carried twenty years.

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_2**: Three weeks. Got it. 

I'll keep the log close. Read them like I'm checking instruments before takeoff. Trust the process, even if I don't understand it.

Just... don't want to let Amanda down again. Or the kids. This has to work.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The log stays close. Read them like instruments.

This isn't about not letting them down - it's about reclaiming what war took from you. The medicine knows the way back.

Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_2**: War didn't take it. I gave it away. Every decision I made over there, every time I pulled the trigger, every time I didn't. That's on me.

But yeah... maybe this medicine can show me how to carry it different. How to be useful again instead of just... angry all the time.

I'll trust it. Don't have much choice left.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You carried what you had to carry. Now you're choosing to carry it different.

The medicine shows you how. Not why - how.

Read your intentions. Trust the process.


**paul_persona_2**: Read them. Trust it. 

That's all I can do, right?


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's it. Read them. Trust it.

Your mission parameters are set.


**paul_persona_2**: Roger that. Mission parameters locked.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Locked and loaded.

See you on the other side.


**paul_persona_2**: Copy that. See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_3**: [Mission complete. Safe travels.]


**paul_persona_2**: Thank you.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Copy that.


**paul_persona_2**: Copy that.
