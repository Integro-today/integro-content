## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know what type of medicine journey you're preparing for and where you're doing this work before we begin.

What's your medicine and where are you journeying?


**paul_persona_3**: Ayahuasca. Going to Rythmia in Costa Rica in three weeks. Heroic Hearts Project set it up. I don't know much about this plant stuff but... well, Amanda says I need to try something different. Can't keep waking up the way I do.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_3**: Amanda. She says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. Hate that I'm doing that to her. Figure this is... I don't know, maybe my last shot at not losing her. Heroic Hearts thinks this plant medicine can help me sleep better, stop the nightmares. I don't buy it, but I'm here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Amanda's scared when you wake up shouting. You hate what that's doing to her, and you're here as maybe your last shot at not losing her.

When you wake up shouting - what's happening in those moments? What are you seeing or feeling?


**paul_persona_3**: It's... I don't know. Just dreams. Same ones over and over - I'm back there, cockpit alarms going off, trying to... trying to get to someone but I can't. Always too late. Sometimes it's my wingman, sometimes... sometimes it's Amanda or the kids. Wake up with my heart pounding like I ran a marathon, can't breathe. Sheets soaked through. Takes me a minute to remember where I am.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Back in the cockpit, alarms screaming, always too late to reach them. Your heart pounding like you just ran out of there, body soaked, taking a minute to remember you're home.

When you imagine sleeping through the night without these dreams, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?


**paul_persona_3**: Maybe... maybe Amanda wouldn't look at me like that anymore. Like she's waiting for me to break. Maybe I could sit through a whole dinner without feeling like I need to jump out of my own skin. Maybe the kids... maybe they wouldn't flinch when I raise my voice about homework. I just want to be the man they think I am, not... not whatever this is.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Amanda wouldn't look at you like you're about to shatter. You could sit through dinner without needing to escape your own skin. The kids wouldn't flinch when you speak.

What's underneath needing to jump out of your skin? What's your body still protecting you from?


**paul_persona_3**: I... I don't know how to say this without sounding... Look, I did what I had to do over there. Made choices. Watched people not make it back. That stays with you. My body just... it won't shut off. Like I'm still waiting for the next threat, next thing I gotta handle. Only there ain't nothing to handle here except mortgage payments and softball practice. Don't make sense.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You made choices over there, watched people not make it back. Now your body won't shut off, still waiting for threats that don't exist here - just mortgage payments and softball practice.

Three main threads here:

1. Finding peace from the nightmares so Amanda stops looking at you like you're about to break
2. Teaching your body it's home now, not still back there waiting for threats
3. Being present with your kids without them flinching when you speak

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's it. I just want to sleep without drowning in it. Want to look at Amanda without seeing that fear in her eyes. Want my kids to feel safe around me. Don't need to be some... I don't know, some enlightened whatever. Just need to stop carrying this weight into every room I walk into.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams
2. I release the hypervigilance and trust I'm home now, not back there
3. I become the steady father my kids can feel safe around

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: The first one hits hardest. "I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams" - that's it. That's what I need.

But the second one... "hypervigilance" sounds like something from a textbook. What about "I release this constant edge and trust I'm home now, not back there"?

Third one feels right too. Just... maybe "I become the steady father my kids deserve" instead?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams"

✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I release this constant edge and trust I'm home now, not back there"

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I become the steady father my kids deserve"

You've got your three intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:

Write them on a card in your wallet
Read them during morning PT
Keep them where you keep your dog tags

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**paul_persona_3**: I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too. Maybe read 'em when I'm out running. Early morning, just me and the road... that's when I can think clearest anyway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:

- I welcome peaceful sleep without drowning in the cockpit dreams
- I release this constant edge and trust I'm home now, not back there  
- I become the steady father my kids deserve

Your ritual: Keep the card in your wallet, read them on early morning runs. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Three weeks. I'll... I'll be ready. Been through worse than this plant stuff, right? Just need to keep these close and... see what happens. Whatever it takes to stop losing Amanda.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You've been through worse than plant medicine. Keep these intentions close on your runs, see what emerges. Whatever it takes to stop losing Amanda - that's what you're carrying with you.

Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: I will. Just... don't tell anyone about this, alright? About the nightmares, the fear. I got people who think I'm the rock, the one who held it together. Let 'em keep thinking that. This is just between us, the medicine, and whatever's out there.


**intentions_workflow_3**: This stays between us. You're the rock for others - that doesn't have to break here. The medicine, your intentions, and whatever's out there - that's your business alone.

You're set. Trust what emerges.


**paul_persona_3**: Good. That's good. I just... I need to do this right. Can't mess it up. Too much riding on it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Doing it right means showing up with these intentions you've built. That's all you control. The medicine handles the rest.

You've got your compass. That's enough.


**paul_persona_3**: Right. Yeah. Just show up and... trust the process. I can do that. Done harder things than this.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly. You've done harder things than this. Show up with your intentions, let the medicine do its work.

Three weeks. You're ready.


**paul_persona_3**: Three weeks. Then maybe I can finally sleep through the night without waking up screaming. Maybe Amanda won't look at me like I'm a stranger anymore. Maybe... maybe I can be who they need me to be again.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Hold that maybe close - sleep through the night, Amanda beside you, being who they need. Your intentions are set for exactly that.

Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: I will. I’m ready to meet whatever’s waiting out there.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. Meet it with your intentions steady in your pocket. You've done the work—now let the medicine meet you halfway.


**paul_persona_3**: Halfway’s all I’ve ever needed. Thanks for walking this stretch with me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Halfway’s all it takes. You walked your own road—I just held the map for a minute.

See you on the other side.


**paul_persona_3**: See you there.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You’ve got this.


**paul_persona_3**: Roger that.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Roger that.


**paul_persona_3**: Out.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Out.


**paul_persona_3**: *radio silence*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *silence acknowledged*


**paul_persona_3**: *...*
