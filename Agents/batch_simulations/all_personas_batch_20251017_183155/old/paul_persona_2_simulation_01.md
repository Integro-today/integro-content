## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_2**: I... I guess Amanda's had enough. She's been patient for years but... last month she told me I either get help or she's taking the kids to her sister's. Said she can't keep watching me wake up screaming at nothing.

Heroic Hearts reached out after I filled out their form. I don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff, but... well, it's either this or lose my family.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Amanda's drawing a line - lose the family or face whatever's making you scream at night. That's real stakes.

The nightmares are costing you everything you care about. What happens in those dreams that has you fighting shadows?


**paul_persona_2**: Look, I don't know if you call 'em nightmares when they're just... memories. Flying over the Hindu Kush, sometimes the mountains look wrong—like they're moving. Or I'm back in the cockpit and my hands aren't on the controls anymore, just floating there while the plane dives.

Other times it's the crew. Guys who didn't make it back. They're standing in my bedroom, asking why I got to go home when they didn't. I wake up swinging sometimes. Amanda... she sleeps in the guest room now. Says she never knows when I'll come up fighting.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The mountains moving, hands floating, crew asking why you made it back - these aren't just dreams. Your body's reliving those moments every night.

Amanda sleeping in the guest room to stay safe. That's the cost. What would change if you could sleep through the night without the memories taking over?


**paul_persona_2**: If I could just... sleep. Wake up without the sheets soaked through, without checking the corners of the room for threats that aren't there. Maybe Amanda would come back to our bed. Maybe I wouldn't see that look in my kids' eyes—like they're walking on eggshells around Dad.

I used to be the rock, you know? The guy everyone counted on. Now I'm jumping at car doors slamming, can't stand crowds at the grocery store. If I could get back to being steady... being someone my family isn't afraid of.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You want to be steady again - the rock your family can count on instead of someone they fear.

Three main threads:
1. Finding peace from the memories so you can sleep without waking up fighting
2. Releasing the hypervigilance - being able to stand in a grocery store without scanning for threats
3. Becoming the steady father your kids aren't afraid of, the husband Amanda can sleep beside

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_2**: Yeah... that about sums it up. I just want to be the man I was before all this. Or maybe not that guy exactly—he was young and stupid. But someone Amanda can trust again, someone my kids aren't worried about.

I need to figure out how to put this stuff down. The memories, the anger, the... whatever this is that's making me someone I don't recognize. I never asked for help before, always thought I could handle it myself. But I'm out of options here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep, releasing the memories that make me fight in the night
2. I put down the hypervigilance, becoming safe enough for Amanda to sleep beside me again
3. I reclaim being the steady father my kids can trust, no longer someone they fear

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_2**: The second one. That's... that's the one. I need Amanda back in our bed. Been sleeping alone for months now, and it's killing us both.

But I don't know about all this "I welcome" and "I reclaim" stuff. Sounds like something from a self-help book. Can we make it more... direct? Like a mission objective or something.


**intentions_workflow_3**: What language feels like yours? Give it to me straight - how would you say it if you were talking to your squad?


**paul_persona_2**: Something like... "I'm done letting this crap control me. Time to put it down so Amanda feels safe coming back to bed."

Or maybe just... "Put the ghosts to rest. Get my wife back."

I don't need fancy words. I need it to work.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "Put the ghosts to rest. Get my wife back."

That's your voice - direct and mission-focused.

How do the other two land? Want to rewrite those in your language too?


**paul_persona_2**: The first one... maybe "Sleep through the damn night without coming up swinging."

Third one... "Be the dad my kids deserve, not the one they have to walk careful around."

Yeah. That sounds like me talking.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "Sleep through the damn night without coming up swinging"

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "Be the dad my kids deserve, not the one they have to walk careful around"

You've got three solid intentions:
1. Sleep through the damn night without coming up swinging
2. Put the ghosts to rest. Get my wife back
3. Be the dad my kids deserve, not the one they have to walk careful around

How do you want to keep these close? Write them on a card, keep them in your wallet? Read them during morning PT? What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**paul_persona_2**: I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet with my pilot's license—been carrying that thing for twenty years. Seems... seems right to keep these close too.

Maybe read 'em when I'm doing push-ups at 4:30. When the house is quiet and it's just me and the demons.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- Sleep through the damn night without coming up swinging
- Put the ghosts to rest. Get my wife back
- Be the dad my kids deserve, not the one they have to walk careful around

Your ritual: Keep them with your pilot's license, read during 4:30 push-ups. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_2**: Yeah. Three weeks. 

Never thought I'd be doing something like this—plant medicine, whatever the hell that means. But Amanda's given me this last chance, and I'm not gonna waste it. These three things... they're everything that matters. Everything I almost lost.

I'll carry 'em close. Let the medicine do whatever it's gonna do. Just gotta trust the process, right?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Trust the process. You've done harder things than this.

Three weeks. Hold your intentions. Let the medicine work.

You're set. Trust what emerges.


**paul_persona_2**: Roger that.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *Roger that.* 

See you on the other side.


**paul_persona_2**: Copy.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Copy.


**paul_persona_2**: Three weeks. Then Costa Rica. Then... whatever comes next.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Costa Rica. Then you find out what’s still standing when the smoke clears.

You’ve got your compass. Now walk.


**paul_persona_2**: Walking.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good.


**paul_persona_2**: Yeah.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Keep walking.


**paul_persona_2**: Every morning at 0430, feet hit the floor, shoes hit the pavement. Same route, same pace, same sweat. If I stop moving, the pictures start. So I keep walking.


**intentions_workflow_3**: 0430 every day - that's your discipline keeping the pictures at bay. The body remembers what the mind won't face.

What are the pictures showing you when you stop?


**paul_persona_2**: I... I don't know. It's just noise. Engine alarms, radio chatter. Sometimes the kid I flew with—Hughes—he's yelling about fuel. But he's dead, so that doesn't make sense. I wake up, sheets soaked, Amanda staring at me like I'm a stranger.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Engine alarms, dead Hughes yelling about fuel, Amanda looking at you like you're someone else. The mission ended but your system never got the order.

What happens in your body when those alarms start? Where do you feel it first?


**paul_persona_2**: Chest—like somebody cinched my harness three clicks too tight. Then the taste of jet fuel in my mouth, even though I’m in my own bed. Heart’s going triple-time, but I’m frozen, can’t move my damn legs. Feels like I’m still strapped in the seat, falling through cloud layer with the engines coughing.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Chest harness cinched tight, jet fuel taste, legs frozen - your body thinks it's still in the seat falling through clouds. Even here, you're strapped in and dropping.

What would it feel like to unbuckle that harness and land safely on your bedroom floor?


**paul_persona_2**: I... I don’t know how. Twenty years of strapping in, checking six, running checklists—unbuckling feels like giving up control. If I’m not the guy holding the stick, who am I?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Twenty years strapped in, checking six, running checklists - that's who you learned to be. Unbuckling feels like surrender because control kept you alive up there.

But you're not in the cockpit now. What part of you survived beyond the pilot's seat?


**paul_persona_2**: Just... the part that gets the kids to school on time. Fixes the garage door opener. Pays the mortgage. It’s not fancy, but it’s steady. That’s all I’ve got left when the engines shut off.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The steady part that gets kids to school, fixes things, pays bills - that's what stayed when the engines cut. Simple, grounded, keeps showing up.

What would it feel like to let that steady part take the controls for once, instead of the pilot who's still flying missions that ended years ago?


**paul_persona_2**: Terrifying. That steady part doesn’t have afterburners or countermeasures—just two hands and a wallet. If I let him fly, what happens when the bogeys come?
