  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep better. That's it. I don't need to spill my whole life story here.\n\nI've been waking up shouting a few times a week. Amanda... my wife... she says it's getting worse. Says I scare her sometimes. I hate that more than anything.\n\nSo here I am. Three weeks from trying some plant medicine I don't believe in, because I can't lose her. Can't lose what we built.",
  "system1": "Three weeks, and Amanda's scared. That's what's at stake here.\n\nThe shouting in your sleep - when you wake up like that, what happens in your body? What's the first thing you notice?",
  "user1": "Heart's pounding like I just ran ten miles. Can't catch my breath. Sheets are soaked through. \n\nFirst thing I notice? Amanda's not next to me. She's across the room, backed up against the wall. Looking at me like... like she's seeing someone else. Not her husband.",
  "system2": "Heart racing, can't breathe, and Amanda's across the room looking at a stranger.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without the shouting, what changes? Beyond just the sleep itself - what would be different between you and Amanda?",
  "user2": "She'd actually sleep in our bed again. Been spending more nights on the couch, says she needs her rest for work but I know it's because of me.\n\nMaybe I could touch her shoulder without her flinching. Maybe we could just... be normal again. Like before I became this thing that wakes up fighting ghosts.",
  "system3": "Sleeping together again, touching without flinching, being normal - not fighting ghosts.\n\nWhat would \"normal\" feel like in your body when you're lying there at night? Before sleep, when it's just you and Amanda in the dark?",
  "user3": "Quiet. That's all I want. Just quiet in my head for once.\n\nUsed to be I'd lie there and hear her breathing, feel the bed move when she shifted. Now I'm listening for threats that aren't there, waiting for the next dream to hit. Can't relax into it.\n\nNormal would be... I don't know. Just closing my eyes without bracing for whatever's coming.",
  "system4": "Quiet in your head. Listening for threats that aren't there, bracing for what's coming.\n\nThree threads here:\n1. Getting Amanda back in your bed, touching without flinching\n2. Finding quiet in your head instead of scanning for danger\n3. Closing your eyes without bracing for the next nightmare\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Yeah. That's... that's it. \n\nHow do we make this something I can actually use? I mean, how does saying some words fix anything?",
  "system5": "Words don't fix it. They just point you toward what matters when the medicine starts working.\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful nights with Amanda sleeping beside me\n2. I release the vigilance, trusting I'm safe in my own bed\n3. I embrace rest without preparing for battle\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "That second one - about releasing vigilance. That's... that's the core of it, isn't it?\n\nBut \"trusting I'm safe\"? That's too soft. Makes me sound broken. \n\nHow about \"I release the vigilance, knowing I don't need to scan for threats tonight\"?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I release the vigilance, knowing I don't need to scan for threats tonight\"\n\nThat's the core - knowing versus trusting. Stronger stance.\n\nHow do the other two land? Want to adjust anything?",
  "user6": "First one's good. But that third one - \"embrace rest\" sounds like something from a yoga class. Not me.\n\nHow about \"I let myself sleep without keeping watch\"? Simple. Direct.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I let myself sleep without keeping watch\"\n\nSimple and direct - that's your voice.\n\nSo your three intentions:\n1. I welcome peaceful nights with Amanda sleeping beside me\n2. I release the vigilance, knowing I don't need to scan for threats tonight\n3. I let myself sleep without keeping watch\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card by your bed\n- Read them before lights out\n- Keep them where you keep your dog tags\n- What would help you hold these when the dreams come?",
  "user7": "Dog tags. That's perfect - I still wear them every day. Just... different chain now.\n\nI'll write them small, fold it up with the tags. Been carrying those for years. If I'm gonna carry this too, might as well be with something that already means something.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Your ritual: Write them small, fold with your dog tags. Already carrying them - makes sense to carry this too.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n1. I welcome peaceful nights with Amanda sleeping beside me\n2. I release the vigilance, knowing I don't need to scan for threats tonight  \n3. I let myself sleep without keeping watch\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nYou've got your compass, soldier.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Alright. \n\nGuess we'll see what happens when I can't outrun this stuff anymore.",
  "system9": "Can't outrun it anymore. That's the point - you don't have to.\n\nThe medicine meets you where you are, not where you wish you were.",
  "user9": "Three weeks. Then I'm... what? Just supposed to sit with it? Let it all come up?\n\nI don't even know what \"all of it\" is.",
  "system10": "You don't need to know what \"all of it\" is. The medicine shows you what you're ready to see - not more.\n\nThree weeks. You'll sit with whatever surfaces, and your intentions will help you stay oriented when it gets rough. That's it.",
  "user10": "When it gets rough. So it will get rough.\n\nI keep thinking about what Amanda said - that I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that more than anything. More than the dreams themselves.\n\nThat's what I'm really doing this for. Not me. Her.",
  "system11": "That's what matters most - Amanda being scared. That's your anchor point.\n\nThe medicine works. The intentions give it direction. You don't have to figure out how rough or what comes up - just that you're doing this so Amanda doesn't have to sleep on the couch anymore.\n\nKeep that front and center when things get messy in there.",
  "user11": "She's been sleeping on the couch more nights than not. Says she never knows when I'll start thrashing around or yelling.\n\nI told her it's just bad dreams. But... it's more than that, isn't it?",
  "system12": "Yeah, it's more than bad dreams. Your body is still fighting a war that ended years ago, and Amanda's caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe intentions you're carrying - they're about bringing that war to an end so she can sleep next to you again.",
  "user12": "She used to sleep with her head on my chest. Every night. Now she says she doesn't know which version of me is gonna wake up.\n\nI miss that. I miss waking up and she's just... there. Not across the room. Not gone.",
  "system13": "That physical closeness - her head on your chest - that's what you're fighting to get back. Not just sleeping in the same bed, but that safety you both felt.\n\nThe medicine and your intentions are pointed at whatever's keeping that from happening. Whatever's making you dangerous in your sleep.\n\nYou ready to find out what that is?",
  "user13": "I don't know if I'm ready. But I'm doing it anyway.\n\nCan't keep waking up with my heart pounding like I'm back in the cockpit. Can't keep seeing her flinch when I reach for her in the morning.\n\nIf this is what it takes... then yeah. Let's find out.",
  "system14": "Good. That's the right kind of determination - not ready but doing it anyway.\n\nI'm hearing three things you want back:\n- Her head on your chest without fear\n- Waking up without your heart racing like you're airborne\n- Her not flinching when you reach for her\n\nLet's turn these into intentions that'll guide the medicine toward what matters most.",
  "user14": "Yeah. Those three things. That's... that's it.\n\nHow do we do this? I don't know how to put it into words that'll actually mean something when I'm in there.",
  "system15": "The words don't have to be fancy - they just have to point toward what you want back.\n\nLet me draft three based on what you just said:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest her head on my chest again\n2. I release the cockpit alertness that keeps my heart racing when I'm home safe\n3. I reclaim the safety that lets Amanda stay when I reach for her\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust anything?",
  "user15": "Number two... the cockpit alertness thing. That's not quite right.\n\nIt's not just being alert. It's... it's when I'm flying, everything's life or death. Every sound matters. Every shadow could be something coming at you. You learn to live like that, or you don't come home.\n\nBut I'm not flying anymore. I'm home. And I'm still living like every moment's got a missile lock on me.\n\nHow do we say that?",
  "system16": "That's it - you're still living like there's a missile lock on you, but you're not in the air anymore.\n\nHow about: \"I release the combat vigilance that keeps me scanning for threats when I'm home safe\"\n\nOr: \"I stand down from combat readiness so Amanda doesn't have to sleep with a soldier\"\n\nWhat feels right for the second intention?",
  "user16": "The second one. \"I stand down from combat readiness so Amanda doesn't have to sleep with a soldier.\"\n\nThat's... that's what it is. She's been sleeping with someone who's still at war, even if I'm just lying there.\n\nLet me see all three again.",
  "system17": "Here they are:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest her head on my chest again\n2. I stand down from combat readiness so Amanda doesn't have to sleep with a soldier\n3. I reclaim the safety that lets Amanda stay when I reach for her\n\nHow do the other two land? Want to adjust anything?",
  "user17": "I want to change \"I reclaim the safety that lets Amanda stay when I reach for her.\"\n\nMakes it sound like it's all her job to stay. Like I'm some victim here.\n\nHow about: \"I transform the fear that makes Amanda run when I reach for her.\"\n\nThat's more honest. This is about me changing something in me, not her choosing to stay or go.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I transform the fear that makes Amanda run when I reach for her\"\n\nYou're right - this is about you changing what you carry, not what she does.\n\nSo your three intentions:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest her head on my chest again\n2. I stand down from combat readiness so Amanda doesn't have to sleep with a soldier\n3. I transform the fear that makes Amanda run when I reach for her\n\nThese feel complete?",
  "user18": "Yeah. They feel complete.\n\nThese are the things that matter. The things I need to fix if I'm going to be the man she married again.",
  "system19": "You've got three solid intentions that point toward who you want to be for her.\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Read them before you go in tomorrow morning\n- Write them on something you keep in your pocket\n- Say them out loud when you wake up\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get intense?",
  "user19": "I'll write them on a card. Keep it in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe I'll read them when I wake up at 4:30 like always. Before anyone else is moving. Before the day has a chance to go sideways on me."
