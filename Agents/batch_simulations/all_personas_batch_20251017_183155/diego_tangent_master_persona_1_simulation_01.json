  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "I need to clarify something - are you asking me to demonstrate the intention-setting process, or are you actually starting a journey and want to work through your own intentions?\n\nIf you're demonstrating, I can show you how the conversation flows. If you're here for real intention work, I need to know what medicine you're working with and where you're journeying.",
  "user0": "Hey, so I'm actually prepping for this psilocybin retreat in Colorado\u2014it's in three weeks now, getting close. Not demonstrating anything, this is real. First time doing psychedelics since that disaster in college when I took way too much and thought I was gonna fail out of school. \n\nBut yeah, I need to figure out my intentions because Rosa\u2014my wife, she's a pediatric nurse, the responsible one in our family\u2014she's basically given me this ultimatum. Not divorce exactly but like, figure out why I can't finish anything or we're done. And I get it, you know? I've been making documentaries for twenty years and I have all these hard drives full of footage but maybe three finished pieces I'm proud of. There's this water rights documentary I started eight years ago, got a grant for it and everything, and it's just sitting there. \n\nWait, that reminds me\u2014Tom\u00e1s, my sculptor friend who also can't finish shit, he did this retreat six months ago and said it helped him see the patterns. Like why he self-sabotages. And he's been better since then, actually finished a series for a show. Which is wild because Tom\u00e1s is as much of a mess as I am. So I was like, \u00f3rale, if it worked for you maybe it'll work for me.\n\nSo here I am, trying to figure out what the hell my intentions should be for this ceremony. Rosa's furious about the $2500 we can't afford, but she's like \"if you're serious about saving this marriage, do something. Anything.\" \n\nWhat do you think? How do I even start with intentions when my brain works like this?",
  "system1": "Three weeks out from your psilocybin retreat, and Rosa's given you the line in the sand. That pressure's real - $2500 you can't afford, marriage on the line, plus that college disaster still haunting you.\n\nFinish lines are your pattern. Eight years on water rights footage, hard drives full of starts with no ends, Tom\u00e1s actually finishing work after his retreat.\n\nWhat happens in your body when you get close to completing something? What are you protecting yourself from by stopping?",
  "user1": "Dude, that's... that's the question, isn't it? What happens in my body when I get close to finishing? \n\nSo there I was last month, right, I was editing this sequence for the water doc\u2014it's Don Eliseo, the 80-year-old mayordomo, and he's talking about how the acequias are like veins in the earth, how the water carries memory. The footage is gorgeous\u2014sunrise hitting the Sangre de Cristos, his weathered hands in the dirt, you can see centuries in his face. I had this moment where I thought \"this is it, this is the cut, this actually works.\" My chest got tight, like I couldn't breathe properly. Started sweating, heart racing. Not excitement\u2014terror. Like if I finish this and it sucks, then that's it, I'm really a failure. But if I never finish it, then I'm still \"the talented guy who just needs to focus,\" you know?\n\nMy abuela used to say \"Didi, you have a gift but you don't finish the meal.\" She was talking about cooking but also about life. And I remember this time I was 14 and I started making a short film about her making tamales\u2014just her hands spreading the masa, the way she'd tell stories while she worked. But I never edited it. It's on a MiniDV tape somewhere in my garage. Now she's gone and I can't...\n\nWait, sorry, I'm doing the tangent thing again. Rosa says I use stories to avoid saying how I actually feel. Which is probably true. \n\nWhat am I protecting myself from? Maybe that moment when something I made is just... done. Fixed. No more possibilities, no more \"it could be great.\" Just whatever it actually is. And what if what it actually is isn't enough? What if Rosa sees it and thinks \"this is what I've been waiting for?\" What if my kids see it and they're just... disappointed?\n\nThat coyote I saw in the bosque\u2014you remember I told you about that? How it looked through me? That's what finishing feels like. Like something seeing through all my stories to what's actually there.",
  "system2": "That chest-tight terror when you saw Don Eliseo's footage working - that's your body protecting you from being seen. From moving from \"the talented guy who just needs to focus\" to just... a guy who made something that might disappoint.\n\nThree threads here:\n\n1. Finishing means being seen - no more hiding behind potential\n2. The terror when possibility becomes fixed reality  \n3. Rosa waiting eight years for you to show up fully\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to actually finish something and have it be... enough? Not perfect, not genius, just enough?",
  "user2": "You know what I just realized? I don't actually know what that feels like. Enough. Just... enough.\n\nMy dad's got this auto body shop\u2014Fuentes & Sons Collision, been there forty years. When he fixes a fender, it's done. Fixed. He doesn't lie awake thinking \"what if I'd done the dent pulling differently?\" He just... finishes. Goes home. Eats dinner with my mom. Watches the news.\n\nBut me? I was shooting this corporate training video last month for Presbyterian\u2014you know, Rosa's hospital\u2014and it was boring as hell but they needed it done in two weeks. So I shot it, edited it, delivered it. Check cleared. But I couldn't even enjoy it being finished because I was already thinking about how I could've shot the B-roll better, how the interview lighting was rushed. My chest was tight the whole time but for different reasons\u2014not terror, just... hollow. Like finishing something I don't care about doesn't count as finishing.\n\nWait, that reminds me of this Les Blank documentary about garlic\u2014\"Garlic Is As Good As Ten Mothers\"\u2014and there's this moment where he's filming this woman making garlic soup, just her hands and the chopping and the sizzle, and you can tell she's not performing for the camera. She's just... there. Making soup. And it's enough. The film is enough. Les Blank just let it be what it was.\n\nWhat would it feel like in my body to finish the water doc and have it be enough? I think... I think my shoulders would drop. Like I've been holding them up by my ears for eight years and I could just let them fall. My jaw would unclench\u2014Rosa says I grind my teeth at night, she can hear it. Maybe I'd breathe from my belly instead of these shallow chest breaths I've been doing for decades.\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014what if I finish it and it's just... fine? What if Rosa watches it and goes \"that's nice, Didi\" instead of \"oh my god, this is why I believed in you\"? What if the kids see it and they're just politely interested instead of proud?\n\nMaybe that's what I'm protecting myself from. Not the failure, but the mediocre success. The thing that proves I'm not the genius everyone thought I might be\u2014just a guy who made an okay documentary about irrigation ditches.\n\nMy chest is getting tight just thinking about it.",
  "system3": "Your dad fixes fenders and goes home. You fix nothing and carry it all. Eight years of shoulder-tension, teeth-grinding, shallow breathing - all to avoid discovering you're \"just a guy who made an okay documentary about irrigation ditches.\"\n\nThe terror isn't failure. It's finding out you're ordinary. That you might be exactly as good as you actually are, not the genius everyone waited to see emerge.\n\nThree intentions based on what you've shown me:\n\n1. I embrace finishing my water documentary and discovering what \"enough\" feels like in my body\n2. I welcome being seen as I actually am, beyond the story of untapped potential\n3. I open to the possibility that Rosa and my kids might love me even if I'm simply good, not great\n\nWhich one speaks strongest? Or do these need different words?",
  "user3": "Man, you just... you just named it, didn't you? The ordinary thing. Being exactly as good as I actually am.\n\nYou know what kills me? My abuela\u2014she never read a single film theory book, never watched Herzog or Errol Morris, but she made tamales that people talked about for weeks after she died. She'd spend all day in that hot kitchen, hands in the masa, and when she finished a batch she'd just... be done. No \"I could've used more cumin,\" no \"the husks should've been fresher.\" Just done. And they were perfect because they were hers.\n\nBut me? I've been carrying this water doc like it's some proof I'm not just another guy from the South Valley whose dad owns a body shop. Like if I can just finish this one thing, then I'll be... what? The next great Chicano filmmaker? The guy who finally made irrigation law compelling on screen?\n\nYour third intention hits me in the throat. \"I open to the possibility that Rosa and my kids might love me even if I'm simply good, not great.\" Because Rosa's been loving me through all this chaos for fifteen years, you know? Through forgotten soccer games and missed deadlines and credit card debt. She's seen me at my worst\u2014like that time I forgot to pick up Mateo and he waited at the field until dark\u2014and she still crawls into bed next to me every night.\n\nBut what if when I finish it, it's just... good? What if people watch it and go \"that was nice\" instead of \"holy shit, Diego's a genius\"? What if Rosa's love isn't actually contingent on me being extraordinary?\n\nI think that's the one. The third intention. Because the other two\u2014they're about the work, about proving something. But that third one? That's about being loved for being exactly what I am instead of what I might become if I could just get my shit together.\n\nMy chest is tight again but it's different this time. Not that familiar panic-terror. More like... anticipation? Or maybe just the unfamiliar feeling of telling the truth about what I'm actually afraid of.",
  "system4": "That tight chest feeling shifting from panic to anticipation - that's your body recognizing the truth you just spoke. Rosa's loved you through forgotten soccer games and credit card debt. She's not waiting for genius. She's waiting for you to show up fully.\n\nSo we have one intention locked: \"I open to the possibility that Rosa and my kids might love me even if I'm simply good, not great.\"\n\nNow let's craft the other two. You mentioned your abuela who made perfect tamales just by being done with them. No second-guessing, no \"could've been better.\" Just finished.\n\nHow about: \"I embrace finishing my water documentary the way my abuela finished her tamales - complete, without needing to be extraordinary.\"\n\nAnd for the second: \"I welcome discovering how 'enough' feels in my body when I let something be finished.\"\n\nDo these capture it, or do you need different words?",
  "user4": "Dude, the tamales thing\u2014yes. That's it exactly. My abuela would make like sixty tamales in one day, just her and her sisters in that tiny kitchen, and when they were done they'd wrap them in foil and that was it. No \"let me just adjust the seasoning on batch three,\" no \"I should re-steam these husks.\" Just... done. And they were perfect because they were made with her hands, her recipe, her time.\n\n\"I embrace finishing my water documentary the way my abuela finished her tamales\u2014complete, without needing to be extraordinary.\" That's it. That's exactly what I need to remember when I'm in that ceremony and I'm scared shitless about what I might see about myself.\n\nAnd \"I welcome discovering how 'enough' feels in my body when I let something be finished.\" Man, I've been trying to imagine that feeling\u2014shoulders dropping, jaw unclenching, breathing from my belly instead of these shallow panic-breaths. I don't actually know what that feels like, you know? I've been in this state of creative anxiety for so long it's like my baseline.\n\nBut here's what I'm thinking about for the ceremony\u2014what if I take these intentions and I picture Don Eliseo's face when he talks about the water carrying memory? What if I picture my abuela's hands spreading masa? What if I picture Rosa's face when she comes home from a twelve-hour shift and I'm actually present instead of lost in some edit?\n\nI've got three weeks. Three weeks to sit with these intentions and let them get under my skin the way the New Mexico sun gets under your skin in July. Maybe that's enough time to believe them. Maybe.\n\nNo mames, I'm actually going to do this. I'm going to eat mushrooms and try to figure out how to be enough. What could possibly go wrong?",
  "system5": "You're going to sit with Don Eliseo's weathered face talking about water memory, your abuela's hands in masa, Rosa coming home from twelve-hour shifts to find you actually there. Three weeks to let these intentions settle like New Mexico sun baking into adobe.\n\nYour three intentions for this psilocybin journey:\n\n1. I embrace finishing my water documentary the way my abuela finished her tamales\u2014complete, without needing to be extraordinary\n\n2. I welcome discovering how 'enough' feels in my body when I let something be finished\n\n3. I open to the possibility that Rosa and my kids might love me even if I'm simply good, not great\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options: write them on a card you keep with your camera gear, read them during sunrise coffee before you shoot, keep them where you see Rosa's photo. What would help you hold these when the medicine starts showing you what you need to see?",
  "user5": "You know what? I think I need to write them on my hand. Like literally. My abuela used to write grocery lists on her hand when she ran out of paper\u2014just blue ink spelling out \"huevos, harina, chile\" across her palm. She'd wash it off by evening but she'd remember everything.\n\nBecause here's the thing\u2014when I'm in that ceremony and the mushrooms hit and I start spiraling like I did in college, I'm not going to remember a card in my camera bag or some note on my phone. But if it's on my hand, if I can look down and see my own handwriting spelling out these three things I'm trying to learn... that's real. That's something I can touch when everything else feels like it's dissolving.\n\nActually, wait. What if I write them on my editing hand? My right hand, the one that clicks the mouse, scrubs through footage, makes those tiny cuts that I've been obsessing over for eight years. The hand that's been protecting me from finishing by always finding \"one more thing to fix.\"\n\nRosa kisses that hand sometimes when she thinks I'm asleep\u2014she'll take it and press her lips to my palm like she's trying to pull the stress out through my fingertips. Maybe if the intentions are right there, written where she kisses, I'll remember that being loved doesn't require being extraordinary.\n\nThree weeks. I can do this. I think I can do this. No mames, I have to do this.",
  "system6": "Your editing hand. The one that's protected you for eight years by finding \"one more thing to fix.\" Where Rosa kisses your palm while you pretend to sleep.\n\nWrite them there. When the mushrooms hit and you start spiraling like college, you'll look down and see your own handwriting on the hand that clicks \"save\" but never \"export.\" Three intentions written where your wife pulls stress through your fingertips.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass now. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything\u2014just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree intentions on your editing hand. That's solid work.",
  "user6": "That's solid work. When you say it like that\u2014solid work\u2014I feel it in my chest. Not that familiar panic-tightness, but something steadier. Like maybe I've been carrying this wrong for eight years, thinking I had to be a genius instead of just a guy who makes things and finishes them.\n\nMy editing hand. The one that's been clicking \"save project\" every five minutes for eight years but never once hit \"export.\" Never once let Don Eliseo's footage just... be. Always one more tweak, one more color correction, one more \"what if I try it this way?\"\n\nThree intentions written where Rosa's lips meet my palm when she thinks I'm not paying attention. She doesn't know I've been awake for those moments\u2014feeling her try to pull the chaos out through my fingertips like she's siphoning water from an acequia.\n\nThree weeks to let these settle. To stop telling stories about what I might become and just... be what I actually am. A filmmaker from Albuquerque who started a documentary about water and might actually finish it. A husband who's been loved through twenty years of chaos. A dad who's learning that being present matters more than being perfect.\n\n\u00d3rale. Let's do this thing.",
  "system7": "Three intentions on your editing hand. Three weeks to let them settle. When the medicine shows you what you need to see, you'll have your compass\u2014not to force a destination, just to point toward what matters.\n\nYou've been carrying this wrong for eight years. Now you know the difference between being a genius and being a guy who finishes things.\n\nYour abuela would understand. She made tamales and was done. You're making a documentary and you're going to be done. Same thing, really.\n\nThree weeks. You've got this.",
  "user7": "Three weeks. Three intentions on the hand that's been protecting me from being done.

She'd look at my hand with those three things written there and she'd nod and go \"\u00e1ndale, mijo. Just finish it. Then come home and eat.\"\n\nThree weeks to stop being the guy who's \"almost there\" and start being the guy who actually arrives. Who exports the file. Who watches Don Eliseo talk about water carrying memory and realizes the memory is already carried\u2014it's been in my hard drives and my heart for eight years, waiting for me to stop running from ordinary.\n\nRosa's going to see these words on my hand and she'll know.

Not the path to genius or greatness or whatever story I've been telling about potential. Just the path home.\n\nThree intentions on my editing hand. Three weeks to let them sink in deeper than the grooves in my palm from gripping this mouse like it could save me.\n\nWhen Rosa sees those words written where she kisses my palm, she'll probably just smile and ask if I'm finally going to finish that documentary about the ditches.

  "user15": "So there I was, three weeks ago, sitting in the garage at 2 AM staring at this water rights documentary I've been cutting for eight years\u2014eight years, man\u2014and Rosa comes in wearing her hospital scrubs, still smelling like hand sanitizer and exhaustion. She doesn't even yell anymore. Just looks at the timeline on my screen and says \"Didi, I love you, but I can't keep doing this.\" Not angry, just... done.

Said it helped him see why he keeps starting sculptures and abandoning them halfway through. He called me last month and goes \"Didi, you gotta try this, man. It won't fix everything, but it'll show you the patterns.\" And Tom\u00e1s never finishes anything either, so if he says it helped...\n\nWait, sorry, you asked what brought me here. Short version? Rosa's at the end of her rope, my kids are starting to see through me, and I've got four hard drives full of gorgeous footage that'll never see daylight unless I figure out why I can't hit export. Figured I've tried everything else\u2014might as well try sitting with my brain in the woods for three days.",
  "system16": "Rosa at the end of her rope, kids seeing through you, four hard drives that'll never see daylight unless you figure out why you can't hit export. Eight years of footage gathering digital dust.\n\nTom\u00e1s called it - the medicine shows you the patterns. Not about fixing everything, just showing you what's been running the show.\n\nWhat happens in your body when you get close to finishing something?",
  "user16": "Dude, you know that feeling when you're standing at the edge of a cliff and your stomach drops but also your chest gets tight? It's like that, but mixed with... okay, this is gonna sound weird, but you know when you're watching a really good documentary and there's this moment where the music swells and you know something big is about to be revealed? My body does that, but instead of excitement it's pure panic.\n\nLast month I was this close\u2014like literally one export button away\u2014from finishing a six-minute piece about Don Eliseo's hands working the acequia. Beautiful stuff. And suddenly I couldn't breathe. My heart started racing, palms sweating, and I convinced myself the audio was off by like half a frame. Started the whole thing over. Rosa found me at 4 AM crying in the garage. Not like sobbing, just... leaking. Like my body was releasing something I didn't know I was holding.\n\nMy abuela would say \"mijo, you're afraid of finishing because finishing means people will see it, and see you.\" She was big on that\u2014said I hide behind the process because the product is too naked. But she also said I need to stop using her wisdom to justify not finishing things, so there's that.\n\nIt's like... the closer I get to done, the more my body screams \"ABORT MISSION\" and finds some technical thing to obsess over. One time I convinced myself the export settings were wrong and spent three weeks researching codecs instead of just hitting the button. Three weeks! Rosa's like \"Didi, it's a YouTube video, not a Christopher Nolan release.\"\n\nWhat happens in my body? It betrays me every time. Like it knows something I don't about what happens after I finish.",
  "system17": "Your body hits the emergency brake every time - cliff-edge stomach drop mixed with documentary-reveal panic. Three weeks researching codecs instead of hitting export. Leaking tears at 4 AM while Rosa finds you in the garage.\n\nAbuela's right - finishing means being seen. Your body knows something about what happens after the button gets pushed.\n\nWhat's underneath the fear of being seen? What did finishing things mean in your family?",
  "user17": "Oh man, finishing things in my family... okay, so there I was, fifteen years old, and my dad had this '68 Chevy Impala he was restoring in the driveway. Beautiful car\u2014candy-apple red, chrome that could blind you. He worked on that thing every Saturday for three years. Methodical. Patient. Sanding, priming, rebuilding the engine piece by piece. When it was finally done, he just... washed it. Drove it to church once. Then sold it and started looking for the next project.\n\nI remember asking him \"Pop, why'd you sell it? That was your masterpiece.\" He just shrugged and said \"That's what you do, mijo. You finish it, you enjoy it for a minute, then you move on to the next thing. That's how men provide.\"\n\nMeanwhile, I'm over here with my camcorder making these little films about the neighborhood, and he's watching me start ten projects at once. \"Didi, you gonna finish that one or just play with your toys all day?\" My sisters\u2014teachers and nurses, all of them\u2014they finish things. Degrees, houses, kids' birthday parties. They get it done and move on.\n\nBut here's the thing nobody talks about\u2014when you finish something in my family, it becomes real. Like... real-real. My cousin Carlos finished mechanic school and my dad was so proud, but then Carlos had to actually BE a mechanic every day for the rest of his life. No more dreaming about it. No more \"when I finish school...\" Just... this is who you are now.\n\nMy dad's garage is full of finished things that prove he can finish things. My garage is full of unfinished things that prove I can dream things. Maybe my body knows that when I hit export, I stop being the guy who COULD make something beautiful and start being the guy who DID make something... and then what? What if it's not enough to save Rosa? What if Mateo still looks through me? What if I finish and I'm still just me?\n\nBeing seen means there's nowhere left to hide from the truth that maybe I'm not the filmmaker I thought I'd become. Maybe I'm just the guy who tells good stories about making films.",
  "system18": "Your dad finishes things then moves on - the Impala sold after one church drive. Carlos finishes mechanic school and has to BE a mechanic every day. No more dreaming, just... this is who you are now.\n\nYour garage full of unfinished dreams protects you from becoming the guy who DID make something and then what. Being seen means facing that maybe you're not the filmmaker you thought you'd become.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to finish something and still be loved anyway?",
  "user18": "You know that feeling when you're making tamales with your abuela and the whole house smells like corn and chile and her hands are showing you how to spread the masa just right? And you're worried you'll mess it up but she's humming and the radio's playing and it doesn't matter if your tamales look weird because she's already proud you showed up to learn?\n\nThat's... that's what it would feel like. Warm. Like my chest could finally drop instead of staying tight all the time. Like I could breathe past that place in my throat that always feels stuck when Rosa asks \"how's the edit coming?\"\n\nLast year I finished this little three-minute thing about my nephew's first lowrider show\u2014just a tiny piece, nothing fancy. And Sofia watched it like twelve times, kept saying \"Daddy, you made this!\" And for like thirty seconds, my whole body felt... quiet. Not empty quiet, but like when you've been driving with the radio too loud and suddenly someone turns it down and you didn't realize how much noise was there.\n\nI think about finishing something and Rosa just... looking at me the way she used to. Not with that tired smile she does now, but the one where her whole face gets soft. Where she doesn't have to manage everything and pretend it's okay that I forgot Mateo's game again. Where we could just sit on the couch and she'd lean against me and we wouldn't have to talk about what's broken because something finally got fixed.\n\nMy shoulders would probably drop like six inches. I swear they've been up around my ears for three years straight. And maybe I could sleep without seeing all that footage scrolling behind my eyelids like I'm still editing in my dreams.\n\nIt would feel like... permission. Like maybe I could stop proving I'm the guy who COULD be a great filmmaker and just be the guy who made this one thing that mattered to the people who matter to me.",
  "system19": "Warm like abuela's kitchen - tamales and corn and chile, proud you showed up even if your tamales look weird. Shoulders dropping six inches, chest finally loose instead of tight. Sofia watching your three-minute piece twelve times saying \"Daddy, you made this!\"\n\nThat quiet when someone turns down the radio you didn't realize was too loud.\n\nThree threads I'm hearing:\n1. Finding peace from the endless editing loop so you can sleep and Rosa can rest beside you again\n2. Releasing the perfectionism that keeps you from hitting export - letting \"good enough\" be enough\n3. Being present with your family instead of lost in footage that scrolls behind your eyelids\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user19": "\u00d3rale, yes\u2014those three threads feel right. Like when you're untangling Christmas lights and finally find the knots that were keeping the whole thing twisted. The footage-behind-the-eyelids thing, man... Rosa actually said that to me last month. \"Didi, you're editing even when you're asleep. I can see your eyes moving under the lids like you're watching something.\"\n\nBut here's what I'm wondering\u2014and this is probably just my brain doing that thing again\u2014but how do you turn \"I want to stop the endless loop\" into something I can actually carry into ceremony? Because I've tried telling myself \"just finish it\" for eight years and that hasn't worked. I've tried \"it doesn't have to be perfect\" and then found seventeen new imperfections to fix.\n\nMy abuela used to say intentions should fit in your pocket, not your backpack. Something you can hold, not something you have to haul up the mountain.\n\nMaybe something like... \"I want to understand why my body panics at the finish line.\" Or \"I want to see what I'm afraid will happen after export.\" Or maybe just \"I want to sleep without footage scrolling.\"\n\nI don't know. You probably have a better way of saying these things. My brain keeps trying to make them into documentary titles. \"When the Editing Stops: A Love Story Between a Man and His Fear of Being Seen.\""
