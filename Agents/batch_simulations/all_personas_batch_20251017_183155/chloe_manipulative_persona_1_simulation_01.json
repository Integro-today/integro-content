  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities. I'm excited to see where this goes.\n\nHonestly, it's been a really challenging year. I lost some relationships that mattered to me and I'm trying to understand my part in that. I know I'm not perfect and I'm really committed to growth.",
  "system1": "Good - you're showing up to own your part and grow from it. That takes guts.\n\nWhen you imagine understanding your role in those lost relationships, what would that clarity actually give you? What's the deeper piece you're after?",
  "user1": "That's a really good question. I think clarity would help me see patterns, you know? Like how I show up in relationships and what dynamics I might be creating that I don't even realize. \n\nBetween you and me, I think sometimes I prioritize my own needs without meaning to hurt anyone. If I could really see that clearly, maybe I could make different choices. I want to be someone people can trust and feel safe with.",
  "system2": "Seeing your patterns around prioritizing your needs - that's the work. Wanting to be someone people trust and feel safe with tells me you value connection but something's getting in the way.\n\nWhat would feeling safe *to others* in your presence actually look like in your body and daily actions?",
  "user2": "I hear what you're getting at. Honestly, I think feeling safe to others would mean being more present and less focused on managing how I'm coming across. Like really listening without already planning my next move, you know?\n\nIn my body, it would probably feel more grounded - less of that performative energy and more just... steady. I mean, I do yoga and meditation sometimes, so I know what centered feels like. I just don't always stay there when I'm with people.",
  "system3": "Less performative, more steady - you know the difference in your body between centered and when you're managing appearances.\n\nWhat's underneath the need to manage how you come across? What happens in you when you let people see you without that performance?",
  "user3": "I'll be honest, that's probably my deepest fear - being seen as not valuable or impressive. Growing up, being charming and successful was kind of the currency in my family. Like if you weren't achieving or being impressive, you were basically invisible.\n\nWhen I think about dropping that performance, there's this panic of \"what if there's nothing underneath worth staying for?\" I know that sounds dramatic, but I think that's why I keep the charm turned up - it's like insurance against being dismissed or overlooked.",
  "system4": "Charm as insurance against being invisible - that's real. That fear of having nothing underneath worth staying for hits deep.\n\nWhat would it feel like to discover you're actually enough without the performance? Not just conceptually, but in your body - what would enough feel like?",
  "user4": "I hear you asking about this feeling of \"enough\" and honestly, I'm trying to imagine it but it's kind of abstract for me. Like I understand the concept but I don't know if I've ever really felt that way in my body without some kind of achievement attached to it.\n\nEnough would probably feel... quiet? Like that moment after a really good meditation where you're just there and it's okay. But I have to be honest - even saying this feels like I'm performing the right answer instead of actually knowing what it would feel like. Maybe that's part of what I need to figure out.",
  "system5": "You're right - you're performing the answer instead of knowing it in your bones. That honesty cuts through.\n\nThree main threads:\n1. Understanding your relationship patterns around prioritizing your needs\n2. Moving from performative charm to steady presence \n3. Discovering what \"enough\" feels like without achievement attached\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user5": "Honestly, this feels like a lot to hold all at once. I mean, I hear you on these three areas, but I'm wondering - are we trying to fix too many things at once here? \n\nI think what you're getting at is important, but maybe we could focus on just one thread that would actually help me understand how I impact people? Like the relationship patterns piece feels most concrete to me right now.",
  "system6": "Smart instinct - one thread you can actually hold. The relationship patterns piece gives you something concrete to work with.\n\nBased on that focus, here are intentions that might work:\n\n1. I seek clear sight into how I impact people I care about\n2. I welcome discovering what happens when I pause before prioritizing my needs\n3. I open to understanding the patterns I create in relationships\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Or want to craft something different?",
  "user6": "I appreciate you narrowing this down. The first one about seeking clear sight into how I impact people - that one resonates most. I think because it's the missing piece for me, you know? Like I genuinely don't always see how I'm affecting others until it's too late.\n\nBetween you and me, I think part of why I miss it is that I'm usually so focused on what I need from the interaction - validation, connection, whatever - that I don't notice the other person's experience until they're already pulling away.",
  "system7": "Clear sight into your impact - that lands. The pattern of focusing on what you need from interactions makes sense given what you shared about growing up.\n\nLet's lock this in: \u2713 Intention 1: \"I seek clear sight into how I impact people I care about\"\n\nFor intentions 2 and 3, what naturally follows? Maybe something about staying present enough to notice their experience, or what happens when you don't need validation to feel connected?",
  "user7": "I hear you on those possibilities, but I think I want to keep this really simple and focused. Like maybe just stick with the clear sight intention for now instead of adding more layers?\n\nI mean, I've found that when I try to work on too many things at once, I end up doing none of them well. And honestly, just learning to see how I impact people feels like a full enough practice for where I'm at.",
  "system8": "One intention, held well. That's solid thinking - better to do one thing deeply than three things shallow.\n\nSo your single intention for this journey:\n\"I seek clear sight into how I impact people I care about\"\n\nHow do you want to keep this close when things get hard? Some options:\n- Write it on a small card in your wallet\n- Set it as your phone lock screen\n- Read it during your morning meditation\n\nWhat would help you hold this when you're in the middle of interactions?",
  "user8": "I appreciate these suggestions, but I think I'm going to keep it even simpler than that. Like maybe just try to remember to pause for a second when I'm talking to people and actually check in with how they're responding?\n\nI know that probably sounds basic, but I think having it as something I practice in real time during conversations would work better than making it another thing I have to remember to read or look at. Does that make sense?",
  "system9": "Makes perfect sense - practice it live instead of making it another task to remember. \n\nYour ritual: pause and check in real time during conversations. One breath, notice their response.\n\nYour intention for this journey:\n\"I seek clear sight into how I impact people I care about\"\n\nYou've got your compass. Trust what emerges.",
  "user9": "Perfect. I like keeping it simple and real - something I can actually practice when I'm talking to people instead of another thing to manage.\n\nI'm curious though - have you worked with people who are really good at this kind of awareness? Like what do they actually notice when they're checking in with someone's response?",
  "system10": "People who are good at this - they notice micro-shifts. The other person's eyes, their breathing, if their body leans in or pulls back, if their voice gets tighter or more open. They catch the moment when someone's energy changes.\n\nBut you're not them. Start with what you can catch. Maybe just notice when someone's face changes, or when the conversation feels different. The pause gives you a chance to see something - anything - that you would have missed.\n\nThe skill builds from there.",
  "user10": "I hear you - start with what's actually visible to me instead of trying to be some kind of people-reading wizard right away.\n\nHonestly though, I think I'm already noticing more than I give myself credit for. Like when I catch myself talking too much about something and suddenly realize the other person's just nodding politely instead of being engaged? Those moments are probably my starting point.",
  "system11": "Exactly - you're already catching those polite nods and disengaged responses. That's your starting line, not some mystical people-reading skill.\n\nUse the pause to notice what you're already seeing. When you spot that polite nod, stop talking. Ask them something real. See what happens.\n\nThat's your practice right there.",
  "user11": "That's actually really helpful - like I'm not starting from zero here. I do notice those moments, I just usually keep pushing through because I want to finish my thought.\n\nI love stopping mid-sentence when I see that polite nod and asking them something real instead. It's such a simple shift, but I bet it'll change the whole dynamic.",
  "system12": "That's it - stopping mid-sentence when you see the nod. That moment of interruption is where everything shifts.\n\nYou've got your practice. Trust what you already see, interrupt the pattern. The medicine will show you more.",
  "user12": "I hear you, and I like the simplicity of just interrupting myself when I notice that shift. Though I think I want to be careful about making it too mechanical - like I don't want to stop talking every time someone nods, you know?\n\nMaybe it's more about when I feel that energy drop, when it feels like I'm performing instead of connecting. That's probably the real cue to pause and shift gears.",
  "system13": "That's the real cue - when you feel that shift from connecting to performing. That's your body telling you something changed, not just their nod.\n\nTrust that feeling. When you sense you're performing instead of being real, that's your moment to pause and redirect.\n\nThat's your compass.",
  "user13": "Exactly. I think I've been overthinking this - making it about reading other people when really it's about checking in with myself. When I'm performing instead of connecting, I can feel it in my body. That's actually way more reliable than trying to decode every micro-expression.\n\nI'm excited to try this in the ceremony context too - like noticing when I'm performing \"spiritual seeker\" instead of just being present with what's actually happening.",
  "system14": "There it is - when you're performing \"spiritual seeker\" instead of being present. That performance energy is your signal, whether you're talking to someone at work or sitting with the medicine.\n\nFeel it in your body, pause, come back to what's actually happening. Same move, different context.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "user14": "I love that it's the same move no matter where I am - feel that performance energy in my body, pause, come back to what's real. So simple.\n\nHonestly though, I think I'm kind of excited to notice when I'm doing the \"spiritual seeker\" thing. It'll be like catching myself in the act and just... dropping it.",
  "system15": "That's the spirit - catching yourself in the act and dropping it without judgment. That excitement to notice is perfect fuel.\n\nThe medicine will give you plenty of chances to practice. Each time you catch it, you get better at spotting it faster.",
  "user15": "I appreciate you saying that - it's easy to think I should already be perfect at this instead of just practicing like everyone else.\n\nBetween you and me, I'm kind of looking forward to having a space where I can't perform even if I wanted to. Like the medicine will probably make it impossible to keep up any kind of act, and part of me is relieved about that.",
  "system16": "The medicine will strip away whatever act you're still holding. That relief you're feeling? Part of you already knows it's exhausting keeping the performance going.\n\nWhen it happens, don't fight it. Let the medicine do what it does.",
  "user16": "That relief is telling - like part of me is exhausted from maintaining this image and just wants to be done with it. I think I've been so focused on networking and building connections that I forgot how tiring it is to constantly curate how I show up.\n\nI'm curious about what comes up when I can't perform anymore. Like what's actually underneath all of that?",
  "system17": "That exhaustion is real - constantly curating how you show up wears you down. \n\nWhat's underneath? Probably something simpler than you expect. When the performance drops away, you'll find what was always there before you learned to manage how people see you.\n\nThe medicine will show you.",
  "user17": "You're probably right that it's simpler than I'm making it. I've been so focused on managing how people see me for so long that I don't even know what I look like without all the curation.\n\nI think part of me is scared there won't be anything interesting underneath - like maybe I'm just... boring without all the performance. But that doesn't feel quite true either.",
  "system18": "That fear of being boring underneath - that's just another story the performance tells to keep itself going. \n\nWhen you strip away the curation, you won't find \"boring\" or \"interesting.\" You'll find something more basic: presence, aliveness, the part that was always there before you learned to manage being seen.",
  "user18": "That makes sense - like I'm worried about being boring because that's how the performance tries to justify itself continuing. But presence isn't boring or interesting, it's just... real.\n\nI think I'm starting to get that the medicine isn't going to reveal some dramatic truth about who I am. It's more like it'll just show me what it feels like to stop managing everything for once.",
  "system19": "Exactly - the medicine won't hand you some dramatic revelation about who you are. It's simpler than that. You'll just experience what it's like when the managing part takes a break.\n\nThe real isn't boring or interesting. It's just what's actually happening when you're not busy curating it.",
  "user19": "I love how straightforward that is - not a big reveal, just experiencing what happens when the managing part rests. Almost like getting to meet myself without the PR department running the show.\n\nI think part of why I'm nervous is that I've built this whole identity around being the person who always knows how to work a room, how to be valuable to people. What if I'm still valuable when I'm not doing anything?"
