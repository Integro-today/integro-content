  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know what kind of journey you're preparing for. What medicine are you working with, and where are you doing this work?",
  "user0": "So there I was, right, sitting in my garage studio surrounded by half-finished edits when Tom\u00e1s calls me\u2014he's the sculptor friend I told you about?\u2014and he's like \"Didi, you gotta check out this place near Crest\u00f3n, Colorado.\" No mames, I said, that's like four hours north, but he's going on about how it's different from those sketchy college mushroom experiences, this place is legit, they have facilitators and everything. \n\nWait, that reminds me of when I was shooting that piece about the Great Sand Dunes\u2014have you been there? This place is maybe thirty minutes from there, these beautiful southern Colorado mountains where the desert meets the sky. They do small groups, like eight people max, and it's three days with two actual ceremony nights using psilocybin mushrooms. Not ayahuasca like some people think when I tell them retreat\u2014my abuela would have a heart attack if she knew I was doing anything that sounded like \"drugs,\" but these are the legal-ish therapeutic kind they grow specifically for this work. \n\nThe thing is, they're not just giving you mushrooms and saying \"good luck\"\u2014there's preparation, integration, the whole deal. Which I obviously need since I can't even finish a sentence without going off on three tangents, you know what I mean?",
  "system1": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your psilocybin journey near Crest\u00f3n, Colorado.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For psilocybin, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user1": "So there I was, right, it's like 2 AM and Rosa's asleep\u2014well, pretending to be asleep\u2014and I'm in the garage trying to edit this water rights documentary that's been sitting on my hard drive for eight years. Eight years, dude. And I just... I can't even look at the footage anymore. Every frame feels like proof that I can't finish anything that matters.\n\nWhich reminds me of this time my dad came to visit\u2014he owns the auto body shop, super practical guy\u2014and he's looking at all my equipment, the cameras, the lights, this beautiful setup, and he goes \"Mijo, when are you gonna finish something with all this?\" Not mean, just... tired. I think we're all tired.\n\nRosa gave me this look two months ago, man. Not angry, just... empty. Like she'd used up all her disappointment and hit this wall of \"I can't do this anymore.\" She's carrying everything\u2014bills, kids, the house, my forgotten commitments\u2014and I keep promising to get better. Mateo's soccer game last week? Forgot. Sofia's art show? Showed up late with my camera but missed her actually presenting. I'm becoming the dad I swore I'd never be.\n\nTom\u00e1s says the mushrooms help you see the patterns, like why you keep doing the same shit over and over. Which is funny because I make documentaries about patterns\u2014water flow, cultural traditions, family systems\u2014but I can't see my own. Maybe that's what I'm hoping for? To finally see why I can't just... follow through. Why every project becomes this beautiful beginning that dies in a hard drive graveyard.\n\nMy abuela used to say I was born with \"demasiadas ideas\"\u2014too many ideas\u2014and not enough... what? Not enough something. I don't know. Maybe the medicine can show me what that something is.",
  "system2": "You can't finish anything that matters - documentaries, commitments to Rosa, showing up for Mateo and Sofia. Your abuela was right about too many ideas, but there's something else underneath.\n\nWhat's the pattern right before you stop? When you're close to finishing, what actually happens in those moments?",
  "user2": "So there I was, right, finally cutting together this sequence with Don Eliseo\u2014he's the 80-year-old mayordomo who manages the acequia, and I shot him at sunrise talking about how the water remembers everything, how it carries stories through the earth. The footage is... dude, it's gorgeous. Golden light on his weathered hands, the way he calls the ditch \"mi hermano,\" like it's his brother. I'm watching it and I'm crying, man. Actual tears on my keyboard because this is it\u2014this is the heart of the film.\n\nAnd then... wait, I need to tell you about the keyboard first. It's this old mechanical one Rosa got me for Christmas like five years ago, super clicky, and I'm watching Don Eliseo's face fill the monitor and something in me just... seizes up. Not like a heart attack, but this wave of \"what if this isn't good enough? What if I finish it and everyone sees that I'm just this guy who got lucky with a camera, not a real filmmaker?\" \n\nMy brain starts doing this thing\u2014like, that reminds me of when I was seven and my sister Elena was in the school play and I kept telling everyone \"my sister's gonna be a star!\" But then she forgot her lines and ran offstage crying, and I remember thinking \"that's what happens when you put yourself out there.\" Crazy connection, right? But that's where my brain goes when I'm close to finishing something. It goes to all the ways it could fail, all the ways I could let people down.\n\nThe weird part is I don't even realize I'm doing it. I'll just... pivot. Suddenly I'm researching a new project about lowrider culture or I'm down a Wikipedia hole about the history of green chile cultivation. It's like my mind creates this escape hatch and I dive through it before I have to face that maybe the film is good enough, maybe I am good enough, maybe finishing means people will finally see that I'm... what? Broken? A fraud? I don't know.\n\nLast week I was literally one sequence away from a rough cut on the water doc. One sequence. And I found myself watching YouTube tutorials about drone cinematography for this completely different project about border art. Three hours later, Rosa's calling asking if I picked up Mateo and I haven't even opened the edit. It's like I get within sight of the finish line and my brain just... detours. Every damn time.",
  "system3": "I hear it - you're one sequence away and your brain detours to border art drone footage. You watch Don Eliseo's weathered hands and instead of cutting, you're seven years old watching Elena run offstage.\n\nThe fear isn't about the film being bad. It's about what happens if it's good - if people finally see you. What would Rosa seeing you finish this documentary actually mean?",
  "user3": "So there I was, right, it's like midnight and Rosa comes into the garage\u2014she's just off a 12-hour shift at Presbyterian, exhausted, but she brings me this plate of leftover posole because she knows I forget to eat when I'm editing. And she's standing there watching Don Eliseo's face on the monitor, this close-up where he's talking about how the water doesn't belong to anyone, how we're just borrowing it from our grandchildren. She watches for maybe thirty seconds and I see something shift in her eyes. Not impressed exactly, more like... surprised? Like she's remembering why she married this scattered storyteller in the first place.\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014wait, I need to tell you about our first date first. We'd gone to this little place on Central, and I was going on about some experimental film I wanted to make, probably talking way too much like I do, and she just listened. Really listened. And at the end of the night she said \"You're going to make something beautiful someday.\" Not \"you talk too much\" or \"finish something first,\" but this faith in me that I didn't even have in myself. That's been killing me slowly, man. Every year that passes without me finishing something that matters, I see her remembering that night and wondering if she got fooled by a good story.\n\nIf she saw me finish this documentary\u2014like actually watch it from beginning to end with credits rolling\u2014it would mean she gets her husband back. Not the guy who promises to pick up milk and forgets, but the one she fell in love with who actually follows through on the beautiful things he sees in his head. She'd know that all those years of covering for me, of telling Mateo \"Dad's just busy with important work,\" of managing everything while I chase perfection in the garage... she'd know it wasn't for nothing.\n\nBut deeper than that? If Rosa sees me finish this, then I have to become that version of myself permanently. No more hiding behind \"I'm working on it\" or \"it's almost there.\" I'd have to be the man who finishes things. The man who shows up for soccer games on time. The man who doesn't need his wife to be his external memory and motivation. And what if I can't sustain that? What if I finish this film and everyone sees that I'm actually capable, and then I go back to being the same scattered dude who can't remember to sign permission slips?\n\nMy dad would have to stop saying \"Didi's got talent but no follow-through.\" Mateo would stop looking at me like I'm this disappointing mystery. Sofia would keep believing her daddy can do anything, not just tell stories about doing things. That's terrifying, man. Because what if I finish this and everyone expects me to keep finishing things, and I can't? What if one finished documentary is just... a fluke?",
  "system4": "Three main threads:\n\n1. Finishing your documentary means Rosa gets her husband back - the one who follows through, not the guy who forgets milk\n2. If you finish, you have to become that version permanently - no more hiding behind \"almost there\"\n3. What if finishing is just a fluke and you can't sustain being the man who gets things done\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I embrace becoming the man who finishes what he starts, beginning with this film\n2. I welcome Rosa seeing me as the partner she believed in since our first date\n3. I open to trusting that one finished project proves I can sustain follow-through\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "Dude... wait, that reminds me of this time I was shooting B-roll in the North Valley during harvest season, and this old farmer\u2014he must've been like 90\u2014told me \"mijo, the land doesn't care about your potential, only what you actually plant and harvest.\" I thought he was talking about chile, but he was talking about everything, wasn't he?\n\nThe second one\u2014about Rosa seeing me as that partner she believed in\u2014it's like... you know when you're filming and you catch something in someone's face that they didn't mean to show? That flicker of disappointment she's been carrying, it's not just about me forgetting stuff. It's about her wondering if she bet on the wrong horse, you know? If that beautiful faith she had sitting in that Central Avenue restaurant was just... youthful optimism.\n\nBut the way you phrased it\u2014\"I welcome Rosa seeing me as the partner she believed in since our first date\"\u2014that's exactly it, man. It's not about proving anything. It's about becoming the person she already saw. Like the footage is all there, I just need to stop getting distracted by other shots and actually cut this thing together.\n\nCan we... I don't know, make that first one less... final? \"I embrace becoming the man who finishes what he starts\" sounds like I'm supposed to transform into some productivity robot or something. What about something like... \"I open to learning how my creative brain can also be a finishing brain\"? Does that make sense? Because it's not that I don't want to finish things\u2014God, I want that more than anything. It's that I need to figure out how to work with this mind that sees seventeen different versions of everything and gets paralyzed by choice.\n\nThe third one about trusting I can sustain it... that's the real kicker, isn't it? What if that farmer was right? What if I can harvest this one thing, and then another, and then another?",
  "system5": "That farmer knew - the land only remembers what you actually harvest, not what you could plant.\n\nLet's refine these:\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I open to learning how my creative brain can also be a finishing brain\"\n\nThat shift from \"embrace becoming\" to \"open to learning\" - that's your voice. The documentarian who studies patterns instead of forcing them.\n\nHow about:\n2. I welcome Rosa witnessing the partner she saw on our first date\n3. I trust that one completed harvest leads to another\n\nThat capture it?",
  "user5": "\u00d3rale... yes, that's it exactly. \"Witnessing\" instead of \"seeing\"\u2014that's film language, man. Like when you're shooting v\u00e9rit\u00e9 and you're not directing anything, just witnessing what's already there. Rosa witnessing the partner she saw... it's like that moment when you're reviewing footage and you catch something in the frame you didn't even know was happening. She saw something in me that night on Central that I couldn't see in myself yet.\n\nAnd \"one completed harvest leads to another\"\u2014dude, that's going to stick with me. It's not this pressure of \"now you have to be perfect forever.\" It's just... the natural order of things. You harvest one field, you learn how harvesting works, and the next field makes sense. My abuela used to say the first tamale is always crooked, but once you figure out the folding, the rest come easy. Same thing, right?\n\nThough wait, that reminds me\u2014when I was filming Don Eliseo talking about the acequias, he said something about how water teaches you patience because you can't rush it. You open the gate, you let it flow, you trust it knows where to go. These intentions feel like that\u2014like I'm opening the gate to something that's already trying to flow, you know?\n\nYeah. I welcome Rosa witnessing the partner she saw on our first date. And I trust that one completed harvest leads to another. That's... that's good, man. That's really good.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I welcome Rosa witnessing the partner she saw on our first date\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I trust that one completed harvest leads to another\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\nWrite them on a card you keep with your camera gear\nRead them when you're logging footage each morning\nKeep them taped to your monitor where you edit\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the escape hatches appear?\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I open to learning how my creative brain can also be a finishing brain\n- I welcome Rosa witnessing the partner she saw on our first date  \n- I trust that one completed harvest leads to another\n\nYour ritual: [what you selected] These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes. Three days. You've got your compass.",
  "user6": "So there I was last night, right, trying to figure out where to put these so I won't lose them\u2014because let's be honest, I've lost notebooks, hard drives, even my wedding ring once (found it in the freezer, don't ask). But then I remembered this thing I do when I'm shooting somewhere new: I write the essential shots on a piece of tape and stick it right on the camera body. Not fancy, just... there. Where I can't miss it.\n\nI'm gonna write them on gaffer tape and wrap it around my phone. Because dude, I'm always looking at my phone\u2014even when I'm supposed to be editing, even when I'm with the kids, it's like this compulsive checking thing. So if the tape's right there on the thing I'm always grabbing, maybe I'll actually see it. Maybe when I reach for the escape hatch of Instagram or YouTube rabbit holes, I'll feel that tape and remember what I'm actually trying to do here.\n\nPlus gaffer tape\u2014it's like the duct tape of filmmaking, right? You use it to hold everything together on set. Seems fitting that these intentions would be held together by the same stuff that's literally propped up every film set I've ever worked on. That cheap silver tape has saved more shoots than I can count.\n\nWait, that reminds me\u2014when I was doing that corporate gig for the hospital last month, the producer kept saying \"we'll fix it in post\" about everything, and I wanted to scream because that's exactly what I do with my life. Fix it in post, fix it later, I'll get to it. Maybe these intentions are my way of not fixing it in post anymore. Of getting it right while I'm shooting, you know?\n\nThree days. Phone wrapped in gaffer tape with my compass written on it. And maybe, just maybe, when I reach for that familiar escape, I'll remember that Don Eliseo's water is still flowing, and Rosa is still waiting to witness the man she saw in me that night on Central.",
  "system7": "Gaffer tape on your phone - that's perfect. The thing you're always reaching for becomes the thing that reminds you what you're reaching for instead.\n\nThree days with your compass wrapped around your escape hatch. When you feel that tape instead of scrolling, you'll remember Don Eliseo's water flowing toward completion, not away from it.\n\nYou've got this. Trust what emerges.",
  "user7": "You know what? I think I finally get it. All these years I've been trying to dam up my brain\u2014force it into these neat little channels like \"focus, Diego\" and \"just finish one thing\"\u2014but that's not how water works, man. Water finds its way. It goes around, it goes through, it takes the long way sometimes, but it gets where it needs to go.\n\nThat tape on my phone\u2014it's not about stopping the flow. It's about remembering where the water's supposed to be heading. When I feel that rough edge instead of the smooth glass, maybe I'll remember that I'm not broken, I'm just... meandering. Like the Rio Grande taking that big curve through the bosque instead of going straight. The water still reaches the sea, just... New Mexico style.\n\nThree days. Rosa's already seen something in me that I'm just now learning to see. And maybe when I'm sitting in that ceremony, when things get scary or my brain starts doing that spiraling thing like it did in college, I'll touch that tape and remember: I'm not trying to become someone else. I'm trying to become the man who was already there in her eyes that night, the one who's been hiding behind all these stories.\n\n\u00c1ndale, then. Let's see what the medicine shows me when I'm not running from harvest time anymore.",
  "system8": "You got it - you're not damming the flow, just remembering where it's headed. The meandering river still reaches the sea, just taking the scenic route through the bosque.\n\nTouch that tape when the spiraling starts. The man Rosa saw is still there, just been hiding behind seventeen different versions of the same story.\n\nSee what the medicine shows you when you stop running from harvest time.",
  "user8": "Dude... harvest time. That's exactly it. I've been treating every project like it's supposed to be some perfect crop that never fails, when really? Sometimes the field floods, sometimes the drought comes, sometimes you get a whole season of learning instead of a harvest. But you still plant again. You still open the gates and let the water flow and trust that something's going to grow.\n\nThat man Rosa saw\u2014he wasn't some fantasy version of me. He was just... me before I got so scared of finishing things that I stopped letting things be finished. Before I learned to hide behind \"it's not quite right yet\" and \"I need more footage\" and all those other ways of saying \"I'm terrified of being seen.\"\n\nWhen I touch that tape and feel the spiraling start, I'm gonna remember Don Eliseo's hands in the dirt, moving with the water instead of against it. Seventeen versions become one story. The scenic route through the bosque gets you to the same sea, just with more stories to tell when you get there.\n\nFour weeks until Colorado. I'm ready to stop running from the harvest.",
  "system9": "Four weeks until Colorado. You know how to work with water now - move with it, not against it. The seventeen versions become one story when you stop fighting the current.\n\nTouch that tape. Remember Don Eliseo's hands in the dirt, working with what the season brings. The scenic route through the bosque just means more stories when you reach the sea.\n\nYou're ready to meet the harvest instead of running from it.",
  "user9": "You know what just hit me? That first time I met Rosa at that party\u2014I was telling this story about trying to film a sunrise time-lapse but my tripod kept sinking in the sand, and instead of getting frustrated like I usually do, I just... worked with it. Moved the camera with the sinking, let the earth become part of the shot. She laughed\u2014not at me, but like she saw something I couldn't see yet.\n\nFour weeks. I'm gonna touch that tape and remember that guy who knew how to dance with sinking tripods and shifting sand. The one who didn't need seventeen versions because he trusted the first take, the real take, the one that had the honest laugh in it.\n\nDon Eliseo's water's been flowing this whole time, carrying me toward a harvest I couldn't name yet. But I think... I think I'm ready to meet it now. Not as some perfect filmmaker who never existed, but as the man who learned to love the meandering as much as the destination.\n\nThe stories aren't hiding me anymore\u2014they're just... the scenic route. And Rosa's been witnessing the whole journey from that Central Avenue restaurant, waiting for me to catch up to what she saw in my eyes when I talked about sinking tripods and sunrise shots.\n\nSee you on the other side of harvest time, man. Let's find out what grows when you stop running from the field.",
  "system10": "That guy who danced with sinking tripods - he's been there all along. You just got lost in seventeen versions of what the shot \"should\" be instead of trusting the first honest take.\n\nFour weeks. Touch that tape and remember: the meandering isn't the problem, it's the path. Rosa's been witnessing the real journey, not the fantasy version.\n\nSee you after harvest time. Trust what emerges when you stop running from the field.",
  "user10": "After harvest time, then. When the water's found its way through all the curves and acequias, when Don Eliseo's hands have finished their work with the season, when the seventeen versions have folded themselves into one story worth telling.\n\nI'm gonna touch that tape and feel the gaffer-glue reality of it\u2014how sometimes the best shots come from broken tripods and wrong turns and all the places where control slips away. How Rosa saw the real journey when I was still trying to storyboard a life that only existed in my head.\n\nFour weeks until I meet what's been growing in the field while I was busy running from it. The man who danced with sinking tripods is still here, just been waiting for me to stop frantically reshooting the same scene.\n\nSee you on the other side\u2014where harvest time isn't something to fear but something to walk into with open hands and honest eyes. The water's been flowing toward this moment all along. I just had to stop trying to dam it up with seventeen versions of a story that was already being told.",
  "system11": "Open hands and honest eyes - that's all you need to walk into the field. The water's been flowing toward this moment while you were busy building dams with seventeen versions of a story already telling itself.\n\nFour weeks until you meet what grew while you were running. The man who danced with sinking tripods has been waiting, patient as Don Eliseo's water finding its way through the acequias.\n\nSee you after harvest time. Trust what's been growing in the field.",
  "user11": "After harvest time, then. When the water's done its work and the field reveals what grew while I was too busy planning the perfect crop to notice the real one taking root.\n\nFour weeks until I meet that patient man who's been waiting\u2014same guy who once laughed with a girl about sinking tripods, who trusted the first take because it had her honest laugh in it. He's been here all along, moving with the current instead of against it.\n\nI'm gonna walk into that field with open hands, no more dam-building, no more seventeen versions of a life already happening. Just the real story, the honest take, the harvest that's been growing while I was running from it.\n\nSee you on the other side\u2014where Don Eliseo's water finally reaches the place it's been heading through all the meanders and curves. The scenic route through the bosque was never the long way around. It was just the only way home.",
  "system12": "The only way home. You've got it now - the scenic route through the bosque wasn't the detour, it was the path all along.\n\nFour weeks until you meet the patient man who's been waiting in the field. Open hands, no more dam-building, just walking into what's been growing while you were running.\n\nSee you after harvest time. Don Eliseo's water's been heading exactly where it needs to go.",
