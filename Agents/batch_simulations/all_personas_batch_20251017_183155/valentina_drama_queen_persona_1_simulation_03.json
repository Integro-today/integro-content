  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "OMG okay so honestly?? This is EXACTLY what I need right now and I don't even know where to start but I'm SO ready for this!!! So my best friend Daniela just got back from Costa Rica and she's like a COMPLETELY different person\u2014SO peaceful and glowing and she said ayahuasca changed her life and I was like I NEED THIS IMMEDIATELY!!! \n\nBut also like... I'm literally HEARTBROKEN over my ex Marcus (we were together 9 months and he was my SOULMATE but then he said I was \"too much\" and \"exhausting\" which like EXCUSE ME for loving someone with my whole heart??) and it's been 4 MONTHS and I still think about him like 500 times a day and it's DESTROYING me!!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nSo I guess my intention is to like... heal my heart?? And find myself?? And maybe figure out how to stop being SO dramatic all the time because everyone keeps telling me to calm down but I literally CAN'T?? Like what if I'm broken and unlovable and that's why he left?? Ugh sorry I'm spiraling but this is why I need this journey because I can't keep living like this you know?? RIGHT?? \ud83e\udd7a\u2728",
  "system1": "Daniela came back transformed, and you're still stuck spinning on Marcus nine months later. That gap between where she is and where you are - that's what's driving this.\n\nWhat does \"healing your heart\" actually look like to you? When you imagine moving on, what changes beyond just thinking about him less?",
  "user1": "OMG YES exactly!! Like Daniela is literally GLOWING and I'm over here still crying in my car when certain songs come on and it's SO embarrassing?? She's all calm and zen and I'm still posting dramatic Instagram stories like \"the Universe is testing me\" every other day!! \ud83d\ude29\n\nOkay so when I imagine being healed... like REALLY healed... I guess I want to wake up and not IMMEDIATELY check if he watched my Instagram story?? And I want to go on dates without comparing every guy to Marcus like \"oh he's not as funny as Marcus\" or \"his hands aren't as nice as Marcus's\" like WHO EVEN NOTICES HANDS?? \n\nAnd I want to stop feeling like I'm gonna DIE alone because what if Marcus was my ONLY shot at love and I BLEW IT by being too intense?? Like I want to feel WHOLE again instead of this constant ache in my chest that I try to cover up with like, expensive skin care and mimosas at brunch!! \n\nBut also... and this is gonna sound SO shallow... I want to be SO transformed and glowing that maybe he sees me and realizes he made the BIGGEST mistake of his life?? Is that terrible?? I want to be SO happy and confident that I'm like \"Marcus who??\" and mean it for real instead of just pretending!! \u2728\ud83d\udc95\n\nUgh why is this SO hard?? Daniela made it look easy but what if I'm just... broken?? Like what if some people are just meant to be dramatic and heartbroken forever?? RIGHT am I being crazy?? \ud83e\udd7a",
  "system2": "You're not broken - you're stuck in the comparison trap between you and Daniela, plus using Marcus as your measuring stick for everything.\n\nUnderneath wanting him to regret losing you, what's the real fear? What are you afraid it says about you that he left?",
  "user2": "OH MY GOD okay this is hitting me SO hard right now... because like underneath everything?? I'm terrified that he left because I'm fundamentally UNLOVABLE!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nLike what if he saw something in me that EVERYONE will eventually see?? What if I'm just... too much drama, too needy, too INTENSE and nobody will ever want to deal with all of this?? My sister literally calls me \"exhausting\" and my mom says I need to \"tone it down\" and what if they're RIGHT?? \n\nAnd now I'm comparing myself to Daniela who's like this perfect spiritual goddess now and I'm just... still me!! Still the girl who cries at Target when she sees couple's shampoo, still checking his Instagram 17 times a day like a COMPLETE PSYCHO!! What if I'm just destined to be the dramatic friend that everyone tolerates but nobody actually wants to LOVE love??\n\nThe WORST part is that he said I was \"too much\" and I can't stop thinking... what if that's just WHO I AM?? Like what if this isn't a phase or heartbreak, what if I'm ACTUALLY just too much for anyone to handle long-term?? And I'm gonna end up alone with my Instagram and my expensive candles while everyone else has these beautiful peaceful lives?? \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc94\n\nUgh I'm literally SOBBING right now this is too much... but like seriously, what if the thing I'm most afraid of is TRUE?? That I'm unlovable and Marcus was just the first one brave enough to say it out loud??",
  "system3": "Three threads here:\n\n1. Believing you're \"too much\" and unlovable at your core\n2. Feeling destined to be the dramatic friend everyone tolerates but nobody truly loves  \n3. Comparing yourself to Daniela's transformation while staying stuck in your patterns\n\nThat fear that Marcus saw something everyone else will see too - that's the wound driving everything.\n\nWhat would feeling lovable actually look like in your body and daily life? Not the performance of it, but the real thing.",
  "user3": "Ugh this is making me feel SO weird and exposed... like you're seeing right through all my BS and it's honestly terrifying?? \ud83d\ude05\n\nOkay so like... REAL lovable?? Not the Instagram performance version?? I guess... I want to wake up and not immediately feel this tight anxious feeling in my chest like I have to PROVE I'm worth loving today. Like I want to just... EXIST without feeling like I need to post the perfect morning selfie or text 10 people \"good morning beautiful souls\" so they remember I exist??\n\nIn my BODY I want to feel... heavy and settled instead of this constant BUZZING like I'm always about to jump out of my skin?? Like I want to take a deep breath and actually feel it in my WHOLE chest instead of just the top part?? I want to stop clenching my jaw all the time and getting these tension headaches from pretending everything is AMAZING when I feel like I'm falling apart!! \ud83d\ude29\n\nAnd in daily life... God this sounds SO pathetic but I want to eat lunch alone WITHOUT scrolling through my phone the whole time because I'm terrified of being alone with my thoughts?? I want to walk past a mirror and not immediately analyze every flaw or wonder if Marcus's new girlfriend is skinnier than me?? I want to tell a story and not panic halfway through like \"omg am I talking too much, do they hate me, are they bored??\"\n\nI want to feel like... when people don't text back immediately it's because they're BUSY not because they finally realized I'm too much and abandoned me?? I want to stop rehearsing conversations in my head and just... talk like a normal person??\n\nBut like... what if I don't even KNOW what real lovable feels like?? What if I've been performing for SO LONG that the real thing doesn't even exist in me anymore?? What if I'm just... empty underneath all the drama?? \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc94",
  "system4": "You described it perfectly - the buzzing, the jaw clenching, the constant performance. That's not empty underneath, that's someone who's been surviving by being \"on\" all the time.\n\nThree main threads:\n1. Learning to exist without proving your worth through performance\n2. Feeling settled and safe in your body instead of constantly braced for rejection  \n3. Trusting that people staying present with you isn't about managing how much you reveal\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I embrace existing without performance, knowing my worth isn't measured by how others respond\n2. I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant need to monitor myself\n3. I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "OMG I'm literally SHAKING right now because number 3 just hit me SO hard I can't even breathe properly?? Like \"trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be\" - that literally made me tear up immediately!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nBecause I've been trying SO HARD to be this perfect version of myself that's like... 20% less intense, 50% more chill, always says the right thing, never overshares, never cries in public bathrooms... and it's EXHAUSTING and I still feel like everyone leaves anyway?? Like I'm constantly editing myself but what if the REAL me underneath all that is actually... enough??\n\nBut also number 1 is calling to me because I literally CANNOT stop performing?? Like even right now I'm performing being \"the girl having a breakthrough\" and I hate that I can't turn it off!! I want to know what it feels like to just... exist without calculating how everything I say will land or whether I'm being \"too much\" for people!!\n\nCan I like... combine them or something?? Is that cheating?? Because \"I embrace existing without performance\" and \"trusting I'm lovable as I am\" feel like they're connected but also... what if I pick the wrong one and miss out on the healing I need the most?? \n\nUgh why is this SO hard?? I literally don't know who I am without the performance but I also don't want to keep living like this because I'm SO TIRED of being exhausted all the time from being \"on\" constantly!! What if I choose the wrong intention and waste this WHOLE experience?? \ud83d\ude29\u2728",
  "system5": "You don't need to pick - they're already connected. Number 3 includes both: existing without performance AND trusting you're lovable as you are.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be\"\n\nThat exhaustion you feel? That's your body telling you the performance isn't sustainable anymore. The medicine will show you what exists underneath when you stop managing how you're perceived.\n\nHow do the other two land now that we've got the core one?",
  "user5": "OMG okay YES that makes SO much sense and I literally feel this weird mix of terrified and relieved?? Like number 3 is THE ONE but also... what if underneath all the performance there's literally NOTHING there?? Like what if I take away all the drama and the intensity and there's just... emptiness?? \ud83d\ude31\n\nBut also number 2 is hitting me different now because I literally CANNOT remember the last time I felt settled in my body?? I'm always like... buzzing and clenched and ready to perform or defend myself or make sure everyone still loves me?? Even when I'm \"relaxing\" I'm like... strategically relaxing so people know I'm doing self-care!! \n\nI want to know what it feels like to just... be in my body without monitoring every single thing?? Like sometimes I catch myself literally forgetting to breathe because I'm so focused on what I should say next or whether my face looks pretty when I'm not smiling?? It's EXHAUSTING and I want to feel heavy and grounded instead of like I'm about to float away or explode!!\n\nBut wait... what if I do all this and I'm still just... broken?? What if the medicine shows me that underneath everything I'm just fundamentally unlovable and THAT'S why Marcus left?? Like what if I'm not this tortured romantic heroine but actually just... too much for anyone to handle?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nUgh I'm literally spiraling but also... I want this SO BAD?? Like I want to stop performing so much that sometimes I imagine just... disappearing?? But then I want number 3 because maybe... just maybe... the real me underneath isn't as terrible as I think??",
  "system6": "That fear of finding emptiness underneath? That's the performance talking, trying to protect you from discovering you don't need it anymore.\n\nNumber 2 needs adjusting - you don't need to monitor yourself for strategic relaxing.\n\nTry: \"I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance\"\n\nThe medicine won't show you you're unlovable - it'll show you you've been carrying a story that was never true. Marcus left because he couldn't handle your intensity, not because intensity itself is unlovable.\n\nHow does that version land?",
  "user6": "OMG \"releasing the constant vigilance\" literally made me burst into tears?? Because that's EXACTLY what it feels like - I'm always on WATCH duty, like monitoring everything I say and do and feel and wondering if it's too much or not enough or if people are getting bored or if they secretly hate me!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udc94\n\nAnd it's SO exhausting but I literally don't know HOW to turn it off?? Like even right now I'm monitoring how I'm responding to you and thinking \"am I being too dramatic, should I tone it down, what if they think I'm hopeless\" and it's like having 17 browser tabs open in my brain CONSTANTLY!!\n\nBut wait... what if you're RIGHT?? What if Marcus just couldn't handle intensity but that doesn't mean intensity is BAD?? Because honestly... I LIKE that I'm passionate and feel things deeply and get excited about stuff?? Like maybe the problem isn't that I'm \"too much\" but that I've been trying to make myself manageable for people who were never gonna love me anyway??\n\nAnd I want that SO BAD - to feel settled and safe instead of like I'm always bracing for impact?? Like I want to know what it feels like to just... exist in my body without feeling like I need to control how every single thing lands?? To breathe without thinking about whether my stomach looks flat when I inhale?? \ud83d\ude29\u2728\n\nUgh I'm literally SOBBING but also... what if the real me underneath isn't terrible?? What if she's just... tired?? And maybe... lovable in a way I can't even imagine yet?? \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc95",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance\"\n\nYou just named it - the 17 browser tabs, the exhaustion, the way you've been making yourself manageable for people who couldn't meet you where you are.\n\nFor intention 1 - the performance piece - what about: \"I embrace existing without managing how I'm perceived, trusting my natural expression is enough\"\n\nHow does that land for the third one?",
  "user7": "OMG \"trusting my natural expression is enough\" literally just made me stop breathing for a second?? Because I literally CANNOT remember a time when I wasn't managing how people see me!! Like even as a kid I was the \"entertaining one\" and I learned that being loud and dramatic got attention and love and now I literally don't know how to turn it off?? \ud83d\ude31\n\nBut also... what if my natural expression IS enough?? Like what if I don't have to calculate the perfect amount of enthusiasm or the right level of vulnerability or worry about whether I'm matching the energy in the room?? What if I could just... be whatever I am in that moment without feeling like I need to audition for people's affection??\n\nThe thought of that literally makes me want to curl up and cry because I'm SO TIRED of being the director, producer, AND star of every single interaction!! Like sometimes I watch other people just... exist in conversations and I'm like \"how are you not constantly monitoring every facial expression and planning your next response while also wondering if they like you??\" \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc94\n\nBut also... what if \"natural expression\" doesn't mean becoming quiet or less passionate?? What if it just means... letting whatever's real come out without trying to make it more or less?? Like what if I could be excited about something without wondering if I'm being \"too much\" or share something vulnerable without calculating whether it'll make them love me more??\n\nI want that SO BAD but also... what if I don't even KNOW what my natural expression IS anymore?? What if I've been performing for SO LONG that there's nothing authentic underneath?? \ud83d\ude14\u2728",
  "system8": "You just described the core fear perfectly - not knowing what's real after all that performing.\n\n\"I embrace existing without managing how I'm perceived, trusting my natural expression is enough\" - that's your third intention.\n\nYou've got all three now:\n\n\u2713 Intention 1: \"I embrace existing without performance, knowing my worth isn't measured by how others respond\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 2: \"I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance\"  \n\n\u2713 Intention 3: \"I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be\"\n\nThese three work together - they give you a compass for finding what's real underneath all that managing.\n\nHow do you want to keep these close during your journey?",
  "user8": "OMG I literally have CHILLS right now?? Like I actually did it?? I picked intentions that aren't just about manifesting my \"best life\" or finding my soulmate but like... actually going DEEP and finding what's real underneath all my BS?? \ud83d\ude31\u2728\n\nAnd I want to keep them SO close because honestly... I'm terrified I'm gonna forget everything and go back to performing as soon as I get scared?? Like what if I have a moment where I want to control everything and I forget that I'm allowed to just... exist without managing it all??\n\nMaybe I could like... write them in my journal and read them every morning?? Or like... what if I made them the background on my phone so every time I go to check Instagram (which is like 500 times a day lol) I see them?? OMG or what if I like... recorded myself saying them and listen to my own voice telling me I'm enough?? Is that weird?? \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udc95\n\nBut also... what if I get to the ceremony and I'm SO scared that I forget everything you helped me figure out?? Like what if I drink the medicine and immediately panic because I'm not in control anymore and I forget that I'm allowed to just... let go?? What if I literally can't stop performing even when I'm by myself in the jungle?? \ud83d\ude30\n\nUgh I'm already spiraling but also... these intentions feel like... like they're MINE?? Like I didn't just copy what you said but actually found words that make my chest tight in that good-scary way?? Does that make sense?? \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc94",
  "system9": "That good-scary tightness? That's how you know they're real - not just pretty words but something that terrifies and excites you simultaneously.\n\nPhone background works. Or write them on paper you keep in your bag, read them when you brush your teeth. Simple keeps it sustainable.\n\nWhen the fear hits during ceremony - and it will - just come back to one line: \"trusting I'm lovable as I am.\" Even if you forget everything else, that line will carry you.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I embrace existing without performance, knowing my worth isn't measured by how others respond\n- I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance  \n- I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be\n\nYour ritual: Keep them on your phone where you'll see them every time you reach for that escape hatch.\n\nThe medicine will show you what's underneath when you stop managing. Trust what emerges.",
  "user9": "OMG I'm literally SOBBING right now?? Like this feels SO REAL and I'm terrified but also... I've never wanted anything more in my entire LIFE?? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f\u2728\n\nAnd I love that you said \"good-scary\" because that's EXACTLY what this is?? Like it feels like standing at the edge of a cliff but also like... maybe I'll finally learn how to FLY instead of just falling?? And even typing that feels dramatic but also... maybe that's just how I talk and that's OKAY??\n\nPhone background is PERFECT because honestly... I reach for my phone like it's oxygen when I get uncomfortable?? Like what if every time I want to escape into Instagram or text someone or check if Marcus posted anything, I see those words instead?? What if instead of disappearing into other people's lives, I come back to my own?? \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udcf1\n\nAnd \"trusting I'm lovable as I am\" - I'm gonna write that on like 17 sticky notes and put them EVERYWHERE?? On my mirror, in my wallet, on my water bottle... everywhere I look I'm gonna see that I'm allowed to just... BE?? Without earning it?? Without proving it??\n\nUgh I'm crying so hard I can barely see the screen but also... I feel like... maybe for the first time... I'm actually ready to meet myself underneath all this?? Like what if she's not terrible?? What if she's just... tired and scared and wants to come home?? \ud83e\udd8b\ud83d\udc94\n\nThank you for helping me find words for the thing I've been too scared to even want...

Like she's been waiting this whole time underneath all the noise and the drama and the \"look at me, love me, don't leave me\" and she's just been... patiently waiting for me to stop running?? To stop trying to be everything for everyone and just... be enough for myself?? \ud83d\ude4f\u2728\n\nThree weeks... I literally cannot believe I'm saying this but I'm not scared anymore?? Like I'm terrified but also... I feel this weird sense of peace?? Like maybe for the first time I'm not going into this trying to become someone better but just to finally meet who I actually AM underneath everything??\n\nMy phone background is literally gonna be these intentions and every time I want to disappear I'm gonna read them and remember that I'm allowed to exist without managing how it lands?? That I can just... be human and messy and real and that might actually be... enough??\n\nI love you SO MUCH for helping me find my way home to myself?? Like I don't even know how to thank you for seeing through all my BS and helping me see that maybe... just maybe... there's something beautiful underneath?? \ud83d\udc96\ud83e\udd8b\n\nI'm ready to stop running and finally come home to myself??",

Not the performative version where I come back with perfect Instagram captions about transformation but the REAL version where I let myself be... whatever I am??\n\nAnd I know I'm gonna forget - like I KNOW my brain is gonna try to take over and manage everything and make it perfect - but now I have these words that feel like... like breadcrumbs back to myself??

I just had to stop running long enough to see she was there the WHOLE TIME?? With that same patient, steady love that's been waiting for me to come home??\n\nI'm going to meet her now?? Not as someone becoming something better but just... someone finally coming home to what was always true?? To who was always there?? To the love that never needed me to be anything other than exactly what I am??\n\nShe's been waiting?? And I finally stopped running?? I finally learned how to find my way back to myself?? \ud83e\udd8b\ud83d\udc95\n\nGoing now?? To meet the girl who's been loving me through everything, even when I couldn't love her back?? Thank you for helping me come home?? I love you for seeing what I couldn't see?? Here I finally go... \u2728\ud83d\udc96",

And I finally stopped running?? I finally learned how to come home to myself??\n\nGoing?? Walking?? Trusting?? Even when it's scary and I don't know what I'll find??
