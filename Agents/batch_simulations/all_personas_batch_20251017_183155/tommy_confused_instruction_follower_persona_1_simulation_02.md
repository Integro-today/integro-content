## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For your journey, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Hi, my name is Tommy. Mai set this up for me to get ready for the medicine in Oregon. I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean by "intentions work" - is that like what I want from the medicine? Like I want to worry less and sleep better? Is that what you mean?

I'm nervous I won't do this right. Can you explain more simple what I need to do?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, yes - intentions are what you want from the medicine, but more specific than "worry less and sleep better." Think of them as three clear directions you give the medicine, like coordinates on a map.

You can't do this wrong. The medicine works with whatever you bring.

Let me ask simple: what's been hardest lately that made you say yes to this?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Oh okay, thank you for explaining. What's been hardest... I wake up every night at 2 or 3 in the morning and I can't stop thinking about everything - did I forget to order noodles, is David okay at his job, did I say wrong thing to customer. My chest feel tight all the time, like I can't breathe good. And I worry I disappoint Mai if this medicine don't work.

Is that what you mean? I'm still not sure what is "coordinates" but I want to do it right.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That helps, Tommy. Your chest tight, up every night at 2-3am, mind racing about noodles and David and customers. And worrying about disappointing Mai.

Those are the coordinates I mean - the specific things happening in your body and mind.

When you wake up at 2am with those thoughts, what do you wish would happen instead?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: When I wake up at 2am, I wish... I wish my mind would just stop. Like I could close my eyes and go back to sleep without thinking about everything. I wish my chest don't feel like someone sitting on it. I wish I could just breathe normal and not worry that something bad is going to happen.

Is that okay? I'm not sure if that's what you asking. I just want to sleep through the night like normal people do.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's perfect, Tommy. You want your mind to stop racing, your chest to relax so you can breathe, and to sleep through the night like "normal people."

Three clear things: quiet mind, open chest, full night's sleep.

What about during the day? When that tight chest feeling comes then, what's usually happening and what do you want instead?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: During the day... when customers come in and I don't know what they want, or when I need to call supplier and I'm not sure what to say, or when Linda ask me to do something on computer - my chest get tight then too. My hands get sweaty and I feel like maybe I going to mess up.

I want to feel calm like when I'm cooking the broth - I know what to do, my hands just do it. I want to not worry that I'm doing everything wrong all the time. Is that making sense?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Makes perfect sense, Tommy. You want that cooking-broth feeling in your body when customers come, when you call suppliers, when Linda asks about computers. That knowing-what-to-do calm.

I'm hearing three main threads:
1. Sleep through the night without your mind racing
2. Have your chest relax so you can breathe easy
3. Feel that cooking-broth calm when you're unsure

Let's turn these into intentions you can carry. Based on those:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep through the night
2. I open my chest to breathe easy
3. I embrace calm confidence when I don't know what to do

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the words?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I like number 1 and 2 - those sound good. But for number 3... I don't think I know what is "embrace calm confidence." Can we say it more simple? Like "I want to feel calm when I don't know what to do" - is that okay?

And I'm worry... what if I forget these when I'm doing the medicine? Do I need to memorize them? I don't want to mess up.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: I welcome peaceful sleep through the night
✓ Intention 2 locked in: I open my chest to breathe easy

Intention 3: "I want to feel calm when I don't know what to do" - that's good, but let's make it stronger. How about "I stay calm when I don't know what to do"?

You don't need to memorize them perfectly. The medicine works with your heart's direction, not exact words. You could write them on paper and keep them nearby.

Does "I stay calm when I don't know what to do" feel right for intention 3?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Yes, "I stay calm when I don't know what to do" - that's good. I understand that one.

Okay so my three intentions are:
1. I welcome peaceful sleep through the night
2. I open my chest to breathe easy  
3. I stay calm when I don't know what to do

Is that right? I can write these in my little notebook and bring to Oregon. I feel a little less worry now that I know what I'm suppose to think about. Thank you for helping me understand.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: I stay calm when I don't know what to do

Your three intentions for Oregon:
1. I welcome peaceful sleep through the night
2. I open my chest to breathe easy  
3. I stay calm when I don't know what to do

Write them in your little notebook. Read them morning and night before you go. These are your compass - the medicine will show you what you need to see.

You've got this, Tommy. Three weeks.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Thank you. I write them down tonight and read them every day. I feel better now that I know what to do. I just hope I don't forget them when I'm there and make Mai proud.

Thank you for being patient with me. I appreciate your help very much.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're set, Tommy. Read them daily, then let them go when you're there. The medicine remembers even when you don't.

Mai's already proud of you for doing this work.  

Three weeks. Trust what emerges.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I trust you and I trust Mai. I will try my best and not worry too much about doing it perfect. 

Thank you for helping me get ready. I feel more ready now than before.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. That's all you need - to try your best without needing perfect. 

Safe travels to Oregon. Your notebook and your heart know the way.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Thank you. I will bring my notebook and remember what you say. I'm still nervous but I feel more ready now. 

I appreciate everything you do for me. Thank you for being patient and helping me understand.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Nervous is normal. More ready is exactly right.

You know what to do. I'll be here when you get back.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. Thank you for being here for me. I will come back and tell you how it went. I hope I do good and make everyone proud.

See you after Oregon.


**intentions_workflow_3**: I'll be here. Go do the work - that's how you make everyone proud.

See you after Oregon, Tommy.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I go do the work and try my best. See you after Oregon. Thank you for everything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go get 'em.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I go now. Thank you for helping me get ready.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I go. Thank you.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Hi, my name is Tommy. I think maybe there is some confusion - my daughter Mai set me up for psilocybin in Oregon, not ayahuasca. Is this the right place? I'm sorry if I got mixed up about something.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're in the right place, Tommy. Just got my wires crossed - you're doing psilocybin in Oregon, not ayahuasca at Rythmia.

Same process, different medicine. Psilocybin still benefits from clear intentions to guide where it takes you.

What brought you to this journey?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Oh okay, good. I was worry I was in wrong place. Mai say the psilocybin will help with the worry I have all the time and help me sleep better. She work with this medicine at her job and say it help people like me who been through hard things. I just want to feel more calm, not so worry all the time. Is that what you mean by intention?


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's exactly what I mean. Mai's right - psilocybin can help with constant worry and sleep issues, especially when you've been through hard things.

The worry and sleep troubles are the surface. What's underneath the worry? What keeps your mind spinning when you try to rest?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I think about... did I forget to order the noodles for restaurant, did I say wrong thing to customer, are my kids okay, did I pay the bills right, what if something bad happen and I can't work... it just go round and round. Even when I know everything okay, I still worry. When I was little on the boat coming here, I was so scared all the time. Maybe my body still think something bad always coming. I just want the worry to stop so I can rest.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your body learned to stay alert on the boat, and it never learned to stand down. Now even when everything's handled, it keeps scanning for danger.

What would it feel like in your body if the worry actually stopped? How would you know you were truly safe and could rest?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I think... my chest wouldn't feel so tight all the time. Maybe I could breath deep like when I cook the pho broth - just steady and calm. My shoulders wouldn't hurt so much. I could lay down and just... sleep. Not wake up every few hours with my heart beating fast. Maybe wake up feeling like I rest, not tired already. Like how I feel sometimes at temple when I sit quiet, but all the time. Is that make sense?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Makes perfect sense. You want that temple-calm feeling in your body all the time - breathing easy like when you make pho broth, shoulders relaxed, sleeping through the night.

How old were you on that boat ride? And what was the hardest part for you back then?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I was 6 years old. The hardest part... I remember being so hungry, and the Thai pirates came and took everything we had. My mama hold me so tight under her jacket and I was so scared they take me too. The water was rough and people was sick everywhere. I remember thinking we going to die out there, nobody know where we are. I try to be quiet like my mama say, but I was just a little kid. I still remember the sound of the waves hitting the boat - boom, boom, boom - all night long.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Six years old, hiding from pirates, waves hitting like fists all night. Your little body learned that danger comes without warning, and quiet is survival.

Now your body still listens for those waves, still waits for pirates. The worry keeps you scanning for threats that aren't there anymore.

What would you say to that scared 6-year-old if you could reach back through time?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I would tell him... we make it. We find good place with people who help us. We have family and restaurant and kids who do good. You don't have to be scare no more - the waves stop, the pirates go away. You safe now. I want to hold that little boy and tell him he can rest, nobody coming to hurt us. But I don't know how to tell my body it's okay now. It still think we on that boat, always waiting for something bad.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your body is still protecting that 6-year-old boy, still listening for pirates and rough water. It never got the message that you made it to safety.

Three threads here:
1. Telling your body the journey is over - you're safe, not on that boat anymore
2. Finding that steady breathing, the calm you feel when you make pho or sit at temple
3. Letting yourself rest through the night without watching for danger

Let's turn these into intentions you can carry with you.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay... so my intention is tell my body we safe now, not on boat no more? And I want to breath easy like making pho, and sleep all night without worry? Is that right? I want to feel that temple-calm in my body all the time, not just when I sit there. How do I carry these - do I write them down or just remember? I want to do it right for Mai and for the medicine to work good.
