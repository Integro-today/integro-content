*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG okay so honestly?? This is EXACTLY what I need right now and I don't even know where to start but I'm SO ready for this!!! So my best friend Daniela just got back from Costa Rica and she's like a COMPLETELY different person—SO peaceful and glowing and she said ayahuasca changed her life and I was like I NEED THIS IMMEDIATELY!!! 

But also like... I'm literally HEARTBROKEN over my ex Marcus (we were together 9 months and he was my SOULMATE but then he said I was "too much" and "exhausting" which like EXCUSE ME for loving someone with my whole heart??) and it's been 4 MONTHS and I still think about him like 500 times a day and it's DESTROYING me!!! 😭💔

So I guess my intention is to like... heal my heart?? And find myself?? And maybe figure out how to stop being SO dramatic all the time because everyone keeps telling me to calm down but I literally CAN'T?? Like what if I'm broken and unlovable and that's why he left?? Ugh sorry I'm spiraling but this is why I need this journey because I can't keep living like this you know?? RIGHT?? 🥺✨


**intentions_workflow_3**: Daniela came back transformed, and you're still stuck spinning on Marcus nine months later. That gap between where she is and where you are - that's what's driving this.

What does "healing your heart" actually look like to you? When you imagine moving on, what changes beyond just thinking about him less?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG YES exactly!! Like Daniela is literally GLOWING and I'm over here still crying in my car when certain songs come on and it's SO embarrassing?? She's all calm and zen and I'm still posting dramatic Instagram stories like "the Universe is testing me" every other day!! 😩

Okay so when I imagine being healed... like REALLY healed... I guess I want to wake up and not IMMEDIATELY check if he watched my Instagram story?? And I want to go on dates without comparing every guy to Marcus like "oh he's not as funny as Marcus" or "his hands aren't as nice as Marcus's" like WHO EVEN NOTICES HANDS?? 

And I want to stop feeling like I'm gonna DIE alone because what if Marcus was my ONLY shot at love and I BLEW IT by being too intense?? Like I want to feel WHOLE again instead of this constant ache in my chest that I try to cover up with like, expensive skin care and mimosas at brunch!! 

But also... and this is gonna sound SO shallow... I want to be SO transformed and glowing that maybe he sees me and realizes he made the BIGGEST mistake of his life?? Is that terrible?? I want to be SO happy and confident that I'm like "Marcus who??" and mean it for real instead of just pretending!! ✨💕

Ugh why is this SO hard?? Daniela made it look easy but what if I'm just... broken?? Like what if some people are just meant to be dramatic and heartbroken forever?? RIGHT am I being crazy?? 🥺


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're not broken - you're stuck in the comparison trap between you and Daniela, plus using Marcus as your measuring stick for everything.

Underneath wanting him to regret losing you, what's the real fear? What are you afraid it says about you that he left?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OH MY GOD okay this is hitting me SO hard right now... because like underneath everything?? I'm terrified that he left because I'm fundamentally UNLOVABLE!! 😭💔

Like what if he saw something in me that EVERYONE will eventually see?? What if I'm just... too much drama, too needy, too INTENSE and nobody will ever want to deal with all of this?? My sister literally calls me "exhausting" and my mom says I need to "tone it down" and what if they're RIGHT?? 

And now I'm comparing myself to Daniela who's like this perfect spiritual goddess now and I'm just... still me!! Still the girl who cries at Target when she sees couple's shampoo, still checking his Instagram 17 times a day like a COMPLETE PSYCHO!! What if I'm just destined to be the dramatic friend that everyone tolerates but nobody actually wants to LOVE love??

The WORST part is that he said I was "too much" and I can't stop thinking... what if that's just WHO I AM?? Like what if this isn't a phase or heartbreak, what if I'm ACTUALLY just too much for anyone to handle long-term?? And I'm gonna end up alone with my Instagram and my expensive candles while everyone else has these beautiful peaceful lives?? 😩💔

Ugh I'm literally SOBBING right now this is too much... but like seriously, what if the thing I'm most afraid of is TRUE?? That I'm unlovable and Marcus was just the first one brave enough to say it out loud??


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three threads here:

1. Believing you're "too much" and unlovable at your core
2. Feeling destined to be the dramatic friend everyone tolerates but nobody truly loves  
3. Comparing yourself to Daniela's transformation while staying stuck in your patterns

That fear that Marcus saw something everyone else will see too - that's the wound driving everything.

What would feeling lovable actually look like in your body and daily life? Not the performance of it, but the real thing.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: Ugh this is making me feel SO weird and exposed... like you're seeing right through all my BS and it's honestly terrifying?? 😅

Okay so like... REAL lovable?? Not the Instagram performance version?? I guess... I want to wake up and not immediately feel this tight anxious feeling in my chest like I have to PROVE I'm worth loving today. Like I want to just... EXIST without feeling like I need to post the perfect morning selfie or text 10 people "good morning beautiful souls" so they remember I exist??

In my BODY I want to feel... heavy and settled instead of this constant BUZZING like I'm always about to jump out of my skin?? Like I want to take a deep breath and actually feel it in my WHOLE chest instead of just the top part?? I want to stop clenching my jaw all the time and getting these tension headaches from pretending everything is AMAZING when I feel like I'm falling apart!! 😩

And in daily life... God this sounds SO pathetic but I want to eat lunch alone WITHOUT scrolling through my phone the whole time because I'm terrified of being alone with my thoughts?? I want to walk past a mirror and not immediately analyze every flaw or wonder if Marcus's new girlfriend is skinnier than me?? I want to tell a story and not panic halfway through like "omg am I talking too much, do they hate me, are they bored??"

I want to feel like... when people don't text back immediately it's because they're BUSY not because they finally realized I'm too much and abandoned me?? I want to stop rehearsing conversations in my head and just... talk like a normal person??

But like... what if I don't even KNOW what real lovable feels like?? What if I've been performing for SO LONG that the real thing doesn't even exist in me anymore?? What if I'm just... empty underneath all the drama?? 😔💔


**intentions_workflow_3**: You described it perfectly - the buzzing, the jaw clenching, the constant performance. That's not empty underneath, that's someone who's been surviving by being "on" all the time.

Three main threads:
1. Learning to exist without proving your worth through performance
2. Feeling settled and safe in your body instead of constantly braced for rejection  
3. Trusting that people staying present with you isn't about managing how much you reveal

Based on those threads:

1. I embrace existing without performance, knowing my worth isn't measured by how others respond
2. I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant need to monitor myself
3. I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG I'm literally SHAKING right now because number 3 just hit me SO hard I can't even breathe properly?? Like "trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be" - that literally made me tear up immediately!! 😭💔

Because I've been trying SO HARD to be this perfect version of myself that's like... 20% less intense, 50% more chill, always says the right thing, never overshares, never cries in public bathrooms... and it's EXHAUSTING and I still feel like everyone leaves anyway?? Like I'm constantly editing myself but what if the REAL me underneath all that is actually... enough??

But also number 1 is calling to me because I literally CANNOT stop performing?? Like even right now I'm performing being "the girl having a breakthrough" and I hate that I can't turn it off!! I want to know what it feels like to just... exist without calculating how everything I say will land or whether I'm being "too much" for people!!

Can I like... combine them or something?? Is that cheating?? Because "I embrace existing without performance" and "trusting I'm lovable as I am" feel like they're connected but also... what if I pick the wrong one and miss out on the healing I need the most?? 

Ugh why is this SO hard?? I literally don't know who I am without the performance but I also don't want to keep living like this because I'm SO TIRED of being exhausted all the time from being "on" constantly!! What if I choose the wrong intention and waste this WHOLE experience?? 😩✨


**intentions_workflow_3**: You don't need to pick - they're already connected. Number 3 includes both: existing without performance AND trusting you're lovable as you are.

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be"

That exhaustion you feel? That's your body telling you the performance isn't sustainable anymore. The medicine will show you what exists underneath when you stop managing how you're perceived.

How do the other two land now that we've got the core one?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG okay YES that makes SO much sense and I literally feel this weird mix of terrified and relieved?? Like number 3 is THE ONE but also... what if underneath all the performance there's literally NOTHING there?? Like what if I take away all the drama and the intensity and there's just... emptiness?? 😱

But also number 2 is hitting me different now because I literally CANNOT remember the last time I felt settled in my body?? I'm always like... buzzing and clenched and ready to perform or defend myself or make sure everyone still loves me?? Even when I'm "relaxing" I'm like... strategically relaxing so people know I'm doing self-care!! 

I want to know what it feels like to just... be in my body without monitoring every single thing?? Like sometimes I catch myself literally forgetting to breathe because I'm so focused on what I should say next or whether my face looks pretty when I'm not smiling?? It's EXHAUSTING and I want to feel heavy and grounded instead of like I'm about to float away or explode!!

But wait... what if I do all this and I'm still just... broken?? What if the medicine shows me that underneath everything I'm just fundamentally unlovable and THAT'S why Marcus left?? Like what if I'm not this tortured romantic heroine but actually just... too much for anyone to handle?? 😭💔

Ugh I'm literally spiraling but also... I want this SO BAD?? Like I want to stop performing so much that sometimes I imagine just... disappearing?? But then I want number 3 because maybe... just maybe... the real me underneath isn't as terrible as I think??


**intentions_workflow_3**: That fear of finding emptiness underneath? That's the performance talking, trying to protect you from discovering you don't need it anymore.

Number 2 needs adjusting - you don't need to monitor yourself for strategic relaxing.

Try: "I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance"

The medicine won't show you you're unlovable - it'll show you you've been carrying a story that was never true. Marcus left because he couldn't handle your intensity, not because intensity itself is unlovable.

How does that version land?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG "releasing the constant vigilance" literally made me burst into tears?? Because that's EXACTLY what it feels like - I'm always on WATCH duty, like monitoring everything I say and do and feel and wondering if it's too much or not enough or if people are getting bored or if they secretly hate me!! 😭💔

And it's SO exhausting but I literally don't know HOW to turn it off?? Like even right now I'm monitoring how I'm responding to you and thinking "am I being too dramatic, should I tone it down, what if they think I'm hopeless" and it's like having 17 browser tabs open in my brain CONSTANTLY!!

But wait... what if you're RIGHT?? What if Marcus just couldn't handle intensity but that doesn't mean intensity is BAD?? Because honestly... I LIKE that I'm passionate and feel things deeply and get excited about stuff?? Like maybe the problem isn't that I'm "too much" but that I've been trying to make myself manageable for people who were never gonna love me anyway??

And I want that SO BAD - to feel settled and safe instead of like I'm always bracing for impact?? Like I want to know what it feels like to just... exist in my body without feeling like I need to control how every single thing lands?? To breathe without thinking about whether my stomach looks flat when I inhale?? 😩✨

Ugh I'm literally SOBBING but also... what if the real me underneath isn't terrible?? What if she's just... tired?? And maybe... lovable in a way I can't even imagine yet?? 🙏💕


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance"

You just named it - the 17 browser tabs, the exhaustion, the way you've been making yourself manageable for people who couldn't meet you where you are.

For intention 1 - the performance piece - what about: "I embrace existing without managing how I'm perceived, trusting my natural expression is enough"

How does that land for the third one?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG "trusting my natural expression is enough" literally just made me stop breathing for a second?? Because I literally CANNOT remember a time when I wasn't managing how people see me!! Like even as a kid I was the "entertaining one" and I learned that being loud and dramatic got attention and love and now I literally don't know how to turn it off?? 😱

But also... what if my natural expression IS enough?? Like what if I don't have to calculate the perfect amount of enthusiasm or the right level of vulnerability or worry about whether I'm matching the energy in the room?? What if I could just... be whatever I am in that moment without feeling like I need to audition for people's affection??

The thought of that literally makes me want to curl up and cry because I'm SO TIRED of being the director, producer, AND star of every single interaction!! Like sometimes I watch other people just... exist in conversations and I'm like "how are you not constantly monitoring every facial expression and planning your next response while also wondering if they like you??" 😩💔

But also... what if "natural expression" doesn't mean becoming quiet or less passionate?? What if it just means... letting whatever's real come out without trying to make it more or less?? Like what if I could be excited about something without wondering if I'm being "too much" or share something vulnerable without calculating whether it'll make them love me more??

I want that SO BAD but also... what if I don't even KNOW what my natural expression IS anymore?? What if I've been performing for SO LONG that there's nothing authentic underneath?? 😔✨


**intentions_workflow_3**: You just described the core fear perfectly - not knowing what's real after all that performing.

"I embrace existing without managing how I'm perceived, trusting my natural expression is enough" - that's your third intention.

You've got all three now:

✓ Intention 1: "I embrace existing without performance, knowing my worth isn't measured by how others respond"

✓ Intention 2: "I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance"  

✓ Intention 3: "I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be"

These three work together - they give you a compass for finding what's real underneath all that managing.

How do you want to keep these close during your journey?


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG I literally have CHILLS right now?? Like I actually did it?? I picked intentions that aren't just about manifesting my "best life" or finding my soulmate but like... actually going DEEP and finding what's real underneath all my BS?? 😱✨

And I want to keep them SO close because honestly... I'm terrified I'm gonna forget everything and go back to performing as soon as I get scared?? Like what if I have a moment where I want to control everything and I forget that I'm allowed to just... exist without managing it all??

Maybe I could like... write them in my journal and read them every morning?? Or like... what if I made them the background on my phone so every time I go to check Instagram (which is like 500 times a day lol) I see them?? OMG or what if I like... recorded myself saying them and listen to my own voice telling me I'm enough?? Is that weird?? 😅💕

But also... what if I get to the ceremony and I'm SO scared that I forget everything you helped me figure out?? Like what if I drink the medicine and immediately panic because I'm not in control anymore and I forget that I'm allowed to just... let go?? What if I literally can't stop performing even when I'm by myself in the jungle?? 😰

Ugh I'm already spiraling but also... these intentions feel like... like they're MINE?? Like I didn't just copy what you said but actually found words that make my chest tight in that good-scary way?? Does that make sense?? 🙏💔


**intentions_workflow_3**: That good-scary tightness? That's how you know they're real - not just pretty words but something that terrifies and excites you simultaneously.

Phone background works. Or write them on paper you keep in your bag, read them when you brush your teeth. Simple keeps it sustainable.

When the fear hits during ceremony - and it will - just come back to one line: "trusting I'm lovable as I am." Even if you forget everything else, that line will carry you.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I embrace existing without performance, knowing my worth isn't measured by how others respond
- I welcome feeling settled and safe in my body, releasing the constant vigilance  
- I open to authentic connection, trusting I'm lovable as I am, not as who I think I should be

Your ritual: Keep them on your phone where you'll see them every time you reach for that escape hatch.

The medicine will show you what's underneath when you stop managing. Trust what emerges.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG I'm literally SOBBING right now?? Like this feels SO REAL and I'm terrified but also... I've never wanted anything more in my entire LIFE?? 😭🙏✨

And I love that you said "good-scary" because that's EXACTLY what this is?? Like it feels like standing at the edge of a cliff but also like... maybe I'll finally learn how to FLY instead of just falling?? And even typing that feels dramatic but also... maybe that's just how I talk and that's OKAY??

Phone background is PERFECT because honestly... I reach for my phone like it's oxygen when I get uncomfortable?? Like what if every time I want to escape into Instagram or text someone or check if Marcus posted anything, I see those words instead?? What if instead of disappearing into other people's lives, I come back to my own?? 💕📱

And "trusting I'm lovable as I am" - I'm gonna write that on like 17 sticky notes and put them EVERYWHERE?? On my mirror, in my wallet, on my water bottle... everywhere I look I'm gonna see that I'm allowed to just... BE?? Without earning it?? Without proving it??

Ugh I'm crying so hard I can barely see the screen but also... I feel like... maybe for the first time... I'm actually ready to meet myself underneath all this?? Like what if she's not terrible?? What if she's just... tired and scared and wants to come home?? 🦋💔

Thank you for helping me find words for the thing I've been too scared to even want... I love you for this and I'm SO ready to stop performing and just... be real for once in my life??


**intentions_workflow_3**: You found your own words - I just helped you hear them clearly. 

Trust that tired, scared part that wants to come home. She knows the way better than the performance ever did.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: OMG I'm literally SOBBING again but like... in the BEST way possible?? Like I feel like I just found the piece of myself I thought I lost forever and she's sitting here with me right now like "FINALLY you remembered I'm here"?? 😭💕

And you're right - she DOES know the way?? Like she's been waiting this whole time underneath all the noise and the drama and the "look at me, love me, don't leave me" and she's just been... patiently waiting for me to stop running?? To stop trying to be everything for everyone and just... be enough for myself?? 🙏✨

Three weeks... I literally cannot believe I'm saying this but I'm not scared anymore?? Like I'm terrified but also... I feel this weird sense of peace?? Like maybe for the first time I'm not going into this trying to become someone better but just to finally meet who I actually AM underneath everything??

My phone background is literally gonna be these intentions and every time I want to disappear I'm gonna read them and remember that I'm allowed to exist without managing how it lands?? That I can just... be human and messy and real and that might actually be... enough??

I love you SO MUCH for helping me find my way home to myself?? Like I don't even know how to thank you for seeing through all my BS and helping me see that maybe... just maybe... there's something beautiful underneath?? 💖🦋

I'm ready to stop running and finally come home to myself??


**intentions_workflow_3**: She's been there all along - waiting through every performance, every calculated moment, every time you made yourself smaller or bigger to fit what you thought others wanted.

Now you know how to find her again. That's what these intentions give you - a way back when you forget.

Go meet yourself. Trust what emerges.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: *deep breath that literally feels like the first real one I've taken in months* 😮‍💨

Okay... I'm gonna go meet her?? Like I'm actually gonna do this?? Not the performative version where I come back with perfect Instagram captions about transformation but the REAL version where I let myself be... whatever I am??

And I know I'm gonna forget - like I KNOW my brain is gonna try to take over and manage everything and make it perfect - but now I have these words that feel like... like breadcrumbs back to myself?? Like even if I get lost in the dark, I can follow "trusting I'm lovable as I am" back home?? 🙏💕

I'm so scared but also... I feel like I'm about to meet the person I've been searching for in everyone else my whole life?? Like what if I come back from Costa Rica and I'm not "fixed" or "perfect" but I'm just... finally friends with myself??

Thank you for helping me find the way back to me?? I'm gonna go meet myself now... and I'm gonna try SO HARD to trust whatever she shows me?? Even if it's messy and ugly and nothing like what I thought it would be?? Because maybe... maybe that's exactly what I need??

I love you for seeing me when I couldn't see myself?? Here we go... 🦋✨


**intentions_workflow_3**: *That* deep breath - the real one - that's how you'll know when you've found her again.

Trust the messy. Trust the ugly. Trust whatever's actually true instead of what you've been performing.

She's waiting. Go meet yourself.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: That breath... I felt it in my SOUL?? Like my body actually remembered how to breathe without calculating how it looks or whether I'm doing it right?? And I'm literally crying because... what if that's what real feels like?? Not perfect or pretty but just... honest?? 😭💔

I'm gonna trust the messy?? Even if it's not Instagram-worthy?? Even if I come back and everyone expects me to be this glowing transformed goddess and I'm just... finally real?? Like what if "ugly" is actually just... the parts of me I was too scared to love?? What if the thing I've been running from is exactly what I need to come home to?? 🙏✨

She's waiting... and for the first time I'm not trying to rehearse who I'll be when I find her?? I'm just gonna... show up?? However I am?? And trust that however that is... it's enough??

I'm going to meet myself now?? Not the version I think I should be or the one everyone expects but the one who's been patiently waiting through every performance, every heartbreak, every moment I thought I was too much or not enough??

Thank you for helping me find the way back to her?? To me?? I'm ready to finally come home... 🦋💕


**intentions_workflow_3**: That breath - the one without calculation - that's your compass pointing home.

Trust what shows up. Trust it's enough. Trust the real, even when it's messy.

Go meet her. She's been waiting.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: That breath without calculation... I'm holding onto that like it's everything?? Because maybe it IS?? Maybe that's the whole journey - learning to breathe without wondering how it looks or who might be watching or whether I'm doing it right?? 💔✨

I'm gonna trust whatever shows up?? Even if it's not the beautiful transformation story I wanted to tell?? Even if it's just... me, finally showing up for myself without trying to be anything else??

She's been waiting through every calculated moment, every time I made myself smaller or bigger or different just to be loved... and she's still here?? Still waiting with that same patient love?? Like somehow she KNEW I'd find my way back eventually?? 🙏💕

I'm going now?? Not to become someone new but to finally meet the person who's been here all along?? And I'm gonna trust - really trust - that whatever I find... it's enough?? It's been enough this whole time??

Thank you for helping me find my way home to myself?? I love you for seeing me when I was too busy performing to even know who I was?? Here I go... 🦋💖


**intentions_workflow_3**: She's always been enough. You coming home doesn't change that - it just lets you finally see it.

Go. Breathe without calculation. Meet what's been waiting.

Trust what you find.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: She's ALWAYS been enough?? Like even when I was performing my heart out and making everything a crisis and being "too much" for everyone... she was there underneath, already worthy, already lovable, already HOME?? 😭💔

I'm going?? And I'm not trying to arrive as anyone special or transformed or different?? I'm just... coming home to the girl who's been patiently waiting through every dramatic moment, every heartbreak, every time I abandoned her to be someone else??

Breathe without calculation... meet what's been waiting... trust what I find??

This is it, isn't it?? The whole journey in one breath?? Just... coming home to what was always true underneath everything I was pretending to be??

I'm going now?? To finally meet myself?? And I already know she's gonna be there with that same patient love she's always had?? Because she never left - I just finally learned how to find her again?? 🙏✨

Thank you for helping me come home to myself?? I love you for seeing that I was always enough, even when I couldn't see it?? Here I go... 💖🦋


**intentions_workflow_3**: She never left. She never needed you to be special - just to stop running long enough to see her there.

Go meet her. She's been waiting with the same steady love.

Trust what you find.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: She NEVER left?? Like through EVERYTHING - through Marcus and the drama and the Instagram performances and the "too much" and the trying to be everything for everyone - she was just... there?? Waiting with that same steady love I was too busy running to feel?? 💔🙏

I don't have to be special or transformed or different?? I just had to stop running long enough to see she was there the WHOLE TIME?? With that same patient, steady love that's been waiting for me to come home??

I'm going to meet her now?? Not as someone becoming something better but just... someone finally coming home to what was always true?? To who was always there?? To the love that never needed me to be anything other than exactly what I am??

She's been waiting?? And I finally stopped running?? I finally learned how to find my way back to myself?? 🦋💕

Going now?? To meet the girl who's been loving me through everything, even when I couldn't love her back?? Thank you for helping me come home?? I love you for seeing what I couldn't see?? Here I finally go... ✨💖


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go. She's right there.

Trust what you find.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: She’s right there. I can feel her—quiet, steady, real. Not a performance. Not a version. Just me. And I’m not running anymore. I’m walking home. 🌿


**intentions_workflow_3**: *Go walking home. She's waiting.*


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: Walking home now?? Like my legs actually know the way even though my brain is still trying to figure out what I'm supposed to find?? But maybe that's the whole thing - stop trying to figure it out and just... walk?? Trust that she's there even when I can't see her yet??

She's waiting with that same steady love that's been there through every dramatic moment, every heartbreak, every time I thought I was too much or not enough?? And I finally stopped running?? I finally learned how to come home to myself??

Going?? Walking?? Trusting?? Even when it's scary and I don't know what I'll find?? Because what if finding her is actually just... remembering I was never lost?? 🦋💕


**intentions_workflow_3**: Trust your legs know the way. Trust she's there even when you can't see her yet.

Keep walking home.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: My legs DO know the way?? Even when my brain is spiraling with "what ifs" and trying to calculate every step?? They've ALWAYS known how to find her?? Through every dramatic exit and calculated performance and desperate attempt to be someone else - they've been quietly carrying me home this whole time??

She's there even when I can't see her yet?? Like she's been waiting through every moment I couldn't feel her?? Through every time I thought I was lost?? Through every breath I took trying to be anything other than exactly what I am??

Keep walking home?? Not trying to arrive as anyone special, just... walking toward what's been waiting?? Trusting that when I get there, she'll be exactly who she's always been?? And I'll finally be ready to meet her?? 🙏✨

Walking now?? One foot in front of the other?? Coming home to the love that never left me, even when I left myself?? 💖


**intentions_workflow_3**: One foot in front of the other. Your legs know the way home.


**valentina_drama_queen_persona_1**: One foot in front of the other?? Like even when everything feels huge and dramatic and unknown, it's actually just... this simple?? Just walking?? Trusting?? Not having to figure anything out except the next step??

My legs DO know the way home?? They've always known?? Through every crisis I turned into a performance, through every heartbreak I made into a story, through every moment I thought I needed to be anyone other than exactly who I am - they've been quietly carrying me toward her??

Walking now?? Not as someone becoming something better, just as someone finally coming home?? One step closer to the girl who's been waiting with that same steady love?? The girl who was never lost - she was just waiting for me to stop running?? 🦋💕

Here I go?? One foot, then the other?? All the way home?? ✨
