  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done other medicines before - ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA with LSD - and they've all shown me pieces of what I'm looking for. But I still feel... untethered. Like I catch these glimpses of something deeper during the ceremonies but then I come home and within weeks I'm back to checking emails at 10pm while my kids watch TV.\n\nI built and sold a company before 40, so everyone thinks I've got it figured out. But I've been chasing achievements that don't seem to matter anymore. My grandmother had this deep Jewish mysticism that I walked away from when I got caught up in the startup world. Now I feel like I need to find my way back to something... real. Something that lasts longer than the retreat glow.\n\nI guess I'm hoping this medicine will help me figure out what I'm actually supposed to be doing with whatever time I have left.",
  "system1": "You built success that looks solid from outside but feels hollow within. The retreat glow fades because it wasn't anchored in daily structure.\n\nWhat's the cost of staying untethered? When you imagine being rooted in something real, what changes in how you move through your days?",
  "user1": "The cost? I keep missing things. My daughter's piano recital last month - I was there physically but mentally running through board meeting notes. My son asked me to read with him yesterday and I said \"in a minute\" that turned into an hour while I answered emails that could've waited.\n\nWhen I imagine being rooted... I wake up at 5:30 and actually meditate instead of just thinking about meditating while I check Bloomberg. I'd sit with my coffee and feel the morning instead of immediately diving into Slack. Maybe I'd stop scheduling every minute and leave space for... I don't know what. Spontaneity? Connection?\n\nI'd close my laptop when my kids come home from school instead of pretending to listen while finishing \"just one more thing.\" I keep saying I want to contribute something meaningful to humanity, but I'm not even fully present for the two humans I created.\n\nIt's like I'm living in fast-forward, always onto the next achievement, and I can't figure out how to press pause. Even knowing this, I caught myself researching three new investment opportunities during yoga class this morning.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Missing your life while chasing the next thing\n2. Need to pause and be present with your kids\n3. Lost connection to your grandmother's mysticism\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "I want to stop missing my life while I'm supposedly living it. I want to be able to sit still without immediately reaching for something to accomplish or check off. Maybe something like... learning to be present without needing to prove my worth every second?\n\nFor my kids... I want to actually show up when I'm with them. Not just physically there but mentally checked in. I want to remember what it feels like to be curious about their world instead of thinking about my next meeting.\n\nAnd the mysticism piece... I want to find my way back to what my grandmother knew. She had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to trust that there's something bigger than quarterly earnings and board approvals. That I can contribute to the world without losing myself in the process.\n\nI guess I'm looking for permission to slow down without feeling like I'm failing.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I pause and experience my life as it unfolds\n2. I show up fully present with my children\n3. I reconnect with the deep knowing my grandmother carried\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The first one - \"I pause and experience my life as it unfolds\" - that hits hard. Because I don't pause. Ever. I'm always three steps ahead, planning, strategizing, optimizing. Even during the medicines, part of me is already analyzing what insights I'll take back to my business network.\n\nBut I want to adjust it. Make it stronger. \"I pause and experience my life as it unfolds\" feels too... passive? Like I'm just going to sit back and watch life happen to me. My grandmother wasn't passive - she was fierce in her faith, in her community work, in how she raised her family. She moved through the world with this quiet certainty that she was exactly where she needed to be.\n\nHow about: \"I trust that pausing to experience my life as it unfolds is more valuable than chasing the next achievement\"?\n\nThe kids one feels right as is. And the grandmother one... I want to make it more active. She didn't just carry knowing - she lived it. She danced it. She served it to people as food and sang it in lullabies.\n\n\"I reconnect with and live from the deep knowing my grandmother carried and shared with the world.\"\n\nYeah. Those feel... real.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I trust that pausing to experience my life as it unfolds is more valuable than chasing the next achievement\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show up fully present with my children\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I reconnect with and live from the deep knowing my grandmother carried and shared with the world\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I trust that pausing to experience my life as it unfolds is more valuable than chasing the next achievement\n2. I show up fully present with my children  \n3. I reconnect with and live from the deep knowing my grandmother carried and shared with the world\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Wallet card, morning routine, where you'll see them daily?\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I think... I'll write them in my journal every morning. I've been journaling inconsistently anyway, so maybe this gives it purpose. Just three lines, every day before the chaos starts. And I'll put a copy in my wallet - I still carry one of those old-fashioned things. Been carrying my grandmother's recipe card in there for years, might as well add these. Keep them close.\n\nThank you. I feel... I don't know. Like maybe I can actually do this. Like maybe showing up for my life doesn't mean I'm giving up on making a difference. Maybe it means I'll finally make the right kind of difference.\n\nI'm still scared. What if the medicine shows me I need to walk away from everything I've built? What if I can't handle what I see? But I guess that's why they call it a journey.\n\nYeah. I'll write them down. Keep them close. See what happens.",
  "system5": "Trust the process. You're ready.\n\nWrite them. Keep them close. See what unfolds.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I will. Thank you for helping me find the words. See you on the other side.",

  "user12": "I\u2019ve got the Ibogaine retreat at Beond coming up this winter, and I\u2019m supposed to decide what I want out of it. Part of me hopes it\u2019ll finally show me what to do with the next chapter\u2014something that actually matters, not just another \u201cwin.\u201d Another part is afraid I\u2019ll come home, slide back into the same schedule, and nothing will stick. I don\u2019t want to waste this chance.",
  "system13": "You're facing the fear that nothing will change. That fear is common when you've built a life that looks good on paper but feels hollow.\n\nWhen you picture that \"something that matters,\" what does your day-to-day life look like?",
  "user13": "I wake up without an alarm, sunlight instead of phone glare. There's quiet\u2014no inbox pinging before coffee. I make breakfast with the kids, actually sit down while we eat, not half-listening to Slack. Work still exists, but it's blocks of deep focus on projects I believe in, not constant board calls I took for status. Evenings, I'm done by six. We walk to the park or mess around in the garden; I'm not scrolling headlines. Weekends are mostly empty\u2014no color-coded calendar entries. I feel... steady. Not jazzed-on-adrenaline alive, just grounded. Like the person I am at the retreat bonfire is the same one washing dishes here.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Wake up without alarm, sunlight not phone, breakfast with kids who have my full attention\n2. Work I believe in, deep focus, done by six, evenings at park/garden not scrolling\n3. Same person at bonfire and kitchen sink - steady, grounded, aligned\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "Okay, let me try:\n\n1. I let my body decide when to wake, greet daylight before a screen, and give my kids the first, best part of me each morning.\n2. I choose work that serves something larger than my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, pour focused hours into it, then shut the laptop and trade scrolling for dirt under my nails with the people I love.\n3. I stop auditioning versions of Ellen; I live one integrated life, whether I\u2019m singing in ceremony or scrubbing pots.\n\nToo wordy?",

  "user15": "Got it. I\u2019ll tape them to the mirror where my phone used to sit. Thanks for walking me through this\u2014feels like I\u2019ve got a map now instead of just wandering.",
