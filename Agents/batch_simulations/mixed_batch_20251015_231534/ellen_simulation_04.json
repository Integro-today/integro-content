  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing the Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... but this feels different. Like maybe this is the one that'll help me hold onto whatever it is I'm searching for instead of just glimpsing it and losing it again.",
  "system1": "You've had those glimpses and watched them slip away. That pattern can wear you down.\n\nWhat's the thing you're most tired of losing hold of?",
  "user1": "That feeling when I'm with my kids at the park and everything just... clicks. Like I'm not performing or achieving anything, I'm just there. Fully there. My grandmother used to call it \"being present to God's presence\" or something like that. \n\nBut then I get back to my desk and it's like I'm on autopilot again. Making decisions, taking meetings, checking boxes. And even when I meditate or journal, it feels like I'm just going through the motions. Like I'm watching myself do all the right things but I'm not really... inside myself anymore.\n\nI keep thinking about those ayahuasca visions - all those women, my ancestors maybe, telling me to weave something together. But I don't know how to weave anything when I'm constantly pulled in different directions.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with your kids - that \"click\" of just being there\n2. Getting back inside yourself instead of watching from outside\n3. Weaving together your life instead of being pulled apart\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "That feels... right. I guess I've been trying to force myself into some grand spiritual transformation when maybe it's simpler than that. Like learning to stay present even when I'm not in some beautiful ceremonial space with chanting and medicine songs.\n\nI want to figure out how to carry that park feeling into Monday morning board meetings. How to stop feeling like I'm split into all these different versions of myself - the mom, the investor, the seeker, the high-achiever. It's exhausting keeping track of which version I'm supposed to be at any given moment.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim my presence in daily moments - the boardroom, the park, everywhere\n2. I embody wholeness instead of managing separate versions of myself\n3. I weave together all parts of my life into one integrated flow\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The first one - \"I reclaim my presence in daily moments\" - that's it. That hits something deep. I want to feel like I'm actually living my life instead of just... managing it. Like those mornings when I'm running and everything feels clear and connected, but carrying that into the chaos too.\n\nThe second one feels a little too... I don't know, therapy-speak maybe? I get what you're saying about wholeness, but I need something that feels more like me. More grounded.\n\nAnd for the third one - weaving my life together - I keep thinking about my grandmother's faith. Maybe it's not about weaving everything together perfectly. Maybe it's about finding some kind of thread that connects the business decisions and the spiritual seeking and the mom moments. Something that makes them all feel like they're part of the same fabric instead of completely separate worlds.",
  "system4": "I hear you. Let me adjust:\n\n1. I reclaim my presence in daily moments - the boardroom, the park, everywhere \u2713\n\n2. I live my life instead of managing it\n\n3. I follow one thread that connects my business, my seeking, and my mom moments into the same fabric\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user4": "Yes. These feel... real. Like something I could actually remember when things get hectic instead of some lofty idea I'll forget the minute I'm back in my inbox.\n\n\"I live my life instead of managing it\" - that's exactly what I need. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm always one step removed, optimizing and strategizing everything. Even my spiritual practice became another thing to manage perfectly.\n\nAnd the thread one - I think about how my grandmother would light candles on Friday nights and somehow that simple act connected her to everything else she did. Work, family, faith - it was all part of the same thing. I want to find my version of that. Not necessarily candles, but... something that makes it all feel like it belongs together.\n\nThese feel like intentions I can actually hold onto when I'm sitting with the medicine.",
  "system5": "Your 3 intentions:\n1. I reclaim my presence in daily moments - the boardroom, the park, everywhere\n2. I live my life instead of managing it  \n3. I follow one thread that connects my business, my seeking, and my mom moments\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Wallet card, morning routine, where you'll see them?\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I'll write them in the journal I bought after that first ayahuasca retreat - the leather one that's been sitting on my nightstand mostly empty. I'll read them each morning when I wake up at 5:30, before the caffeine and emails start pulling me in different directions.\n\nAnd maybe... maybe I'll tell my kids about them. Simplified, obviously. Something like \"Mommy's learning to be more present and connected.\" They've been asking why I seem \"far away\" sometimes when we're together. This could be how I show them I'm working on it.\n\nYeah. I'm ready.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. Trust the process.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Thank you. Really. This feels... different than my other preparations. More grounded, less like I'm trying to force some big revelation. Just three simple things to remember when everything gets stripped away.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "Trust what comes.",
  "user7": "I will. Whatever shows up\u2014whether it\u2019s the ancestral women again or just my own quiet voice\u2014I\u2019ll meet it without trying to manage the outcome.",
  "system8": "That\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready.",
  "user8": "Then I\u2019m going.",
  "system9": "Go well.",
  "user9": "Thank you.",
  "system10": "You're welcome.",
  "user10": "Hey... I\u2019ve been thinking about what you said before I left. About trusting what comes. I thought I was ready to let go of control, but now I\u2019m wondering if part of my intention should\u2019ve been about learning to *stay* with whatever shows up\u2014not just witness it, but actually let it change me. Not just a one-time surrender, but a practice.\n\nDoes that make sense? Or am I already overcomplicating what was supposed to be simple?",
  "system11": "You're already back-engineering. The intentions you set were enough - they pointed you toward what matters. \n\nThe work now is living what showed up, not perfecting what you wrote beforehand.",
  "user11": "Right. I\u2019m doing it again\u2014trying to optimize the experience after the fact, like it\u2019s another quarterly report I can revise. \n\nWhatever wanted to land already landed. Now I just have to stop running the numbers on it and actually live the damn thing.",
  "system12": "Exactly. Stop analyzing and start walking.",
  "user12": "Walking it is.",
  "system13": "Good.",
  "user13": "I\u2019m out of excuses, then.",
  "system14": "Then you\u2019re exactly where you need to be.",
  "user14": "Feels like standing at the edge of a cliff without the old adrenaline rush telling me to build something\u2014just the wind and the drop.",
  "system15": "That's the spot. Nothing to build - just the next step.",
  "user15": "One foot forward. No pitch deck, no board vote\u2014just the ground that\u2019s already here.",
  "system16": "That's it. The ground holds.",
  "user16": "Funny how solid it feels when I stop trying to pave over it.",
  "system17": "Solid enough to build your compass. Let's set your intentions.",
  "user17": "I want to stop outsourcing my worth to the next deal, the next board seat. I want to remember what my grandmother knew\u2014 that there\u2019s a thread between what I do and who I am, and it\u2019s not made of metrics. I want my kids to feel me here, not just my calendar alerts. And I want to walk out of this knowing the next chapter serves something bigger than my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop outsourcing worth to deals/board seats\n2. Reconnect to grandmother's thread between doing and being\n3. Show up present for kids beyond calendar alerts\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "I release the reflex that says my value is measured by the next win.  \nI follow the quiet thread my grandmother spun between action and soul, letting it guide each choice.  \nWhen my kids speak, I breathe first\u2014then answer with my whole face, not my phone in hand.",
  "system19": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I release the reflex that says my value is measured by the next win\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I follow the quiet thread my grandmother spun between action and soul, letting it guide each choice\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: When my kids speak, I breathe first\u2014then answer with my whole face, not my phone in hand\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I release the reflex that says my value is measured by the next win\n2. I follow the quiet thread my grandmother spun between action and soul, letting it guide each choice  \n3. When my kids speak, I breathe first\u2014then answer with my whole face, not my phone in hand\n\nKeep them where you'll see them daily. These are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "I\u2019ll keep them in my wallet\u2014right beside the photo of Grandma and the kids at the park. Thank you."
