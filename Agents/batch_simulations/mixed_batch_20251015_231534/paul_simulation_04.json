  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... with what's been happening at night. And Amanda\u2014she's at her wit's end. Says she doesn't know who I am anymore when I wake up shouting.\n\nI don't buy into all this spiritual mumbo jumbo. But I can't lose her. Can't keep waking up like that, scaring the kids. If this is what it takes... then here I am.",
  "system1": "Night terrors are wearing you down. The medicine can help reset what's stuck in your nervous system.\n\nWhen these episodes stop, what would change between you and Amanda?",
  "user1": "If they stopped? She'd actually sleep next to me again instead of moving to the couch half the time. Maybe she'd look at me like she used to\u2014not like I'm some unexploded ordnance that might go off.\n\nI miss waking up and seeing her there without that... that fear in her eyes. Like she doesn't know if I'm still fighting some war in my head or if I'm here with her.",
  "system2": "Two main threads:\n\n1. Stop the night terrors that are scaring your family\n2. Get back the connection with Amanda - her looking at you without fear\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "I don't know\u2014this feels like some kind of homework assignment. But alright.\n\nMaybe... \"I want to sleep through the night without dragging Amanda into whatever hell I'm reliving.\" That's the first thing. I need those nights to stop. Need her to feel safe again.\n\nAnd... \"I want to be the man she married, not whatever I've become.\" That's the second thing. Though I don't know if some plant can fix seventeen years of... whatever this is.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I become the steady partner Amanda trusts again\n3. I reclaim the man she fell in love with\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The first two feel... I don't know. Too soft or something. But they're right, I guess.\n\nThat third one though\u2014\"reclaim the man she fell in love with.\" That one sits wrong. I never stopped being that man. I just... I just need to get back to showing up as him. Does that make sense?\n\nMaybe something like \"I show up as the steady partner Amanda can trust again.\" That feels more like something I can actually do, not pretending I'm some broken thing that needs fixing.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I show up as the steady partner Amanda can trust again\n\nHow about the first two? Keep them as is or need adjusting?",
  "user4": "First one's good\u2014\"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" That's what I need. Simple. Direct.\n\nSecond one though... \"I become the steady partner Amanda trusts again\"\u2014that's close but not quite it. It's not about becoming something new. It's about getting back to what I already was, what I should be.\n\nHow about \"I am the steady partner Amanda trusts again.\" Present tense. Like it's already true and I'm just... remembering how to be that way.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I am the steady partner Amanda trusts again\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I am the steady partner Amanda trusts again  \n3. I show up as the steady partner Amanda can trust again\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Wallet card, morning routine, where you'll see them daily?\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Yeah. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I need to go call Amanda.",
  "system6": "Trust the process.",
  "user6": "Trust the process. Right.",
  "system7": "You're ready.",
  "user7": "I don't know about ready. But I'm going.",
  "system8": "You're going. That's what matters.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I'll see you on the other side.",
