## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_8:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**paul_persona_3**: I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this intention stuff might help with... everything. The nightmares, Amanda being scared of me, all of it. So here I am.

I can't keep waking up shouting, can't keep seeing her flinch when I walk into the room. Three weeks until this thing in Costa Rica and I need this to work. Can't lose her.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Sleep through the night peacefully
2. Create safety for Amanda 
3. Find healing from whatever's causing this

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah, those are... those are right. 

I need to sleep. Just... close my eyes and stay asleep until morning like a normal person. Instead of jerking awake at 2 AM thinking I'm back there, hearing things that aren't real.

And Amanda... God, I hate that she looks at me like I'm a loaded gun sometimes. I want her to feel safe again. Want to be able to reach for her without her tensing up.

But I don't know about that third one. "Healing." Sounds like something's broken in me, and I ain't broken. Just need to get this under control.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night
2. I make Amanda feel safe with me again
3. I get control over what hijacks me

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: The second one. "I make Amanda feel safe with me again." That's... that's what matters.

But the wording's off. I don't want to just "make her feel" safe. That sounds like I'm trying to control how she feels or something. 

Maybe... "I become someone Amanda can trust again." Or "I show up steady and calm, the way I used to be." 

I don't know. What do you think? You probably know the right way to say this stuff.


**intentions_workflow_8**: "I show up steady and calm with Amanda" - that's yours. Clear action, no controlling her feelings.

How about:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night
2. I show up steady and calm with Amanda
3. I get control over what hijacks me

How do these land?


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah... yeah, those work. 

"I show up steady and calm with Amanda." I can picture that - coming home from work and not snapping when the kids are loud, not getting that edge in my voice when she asks me what's wrong. Just... being normal again.

The sleep one though... "I sleep peacefully through the night." I want to believe that's possible, but it feels like asking for a miracle. Haven't had more than three, four hours straight in years.

And that third one... "what hijacks me." That's a good way to put it. Not saying I'm broken, just... something takes over sometimes. The anger, the jumping at loud noises, the way I can't breathe right when I hear a helicopter.

These feel right.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ All 3 locked in:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night
2. I show up steady and calm with Amanda
3. I get control over what hijacks me

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**paul_persona_3**: Got it. Three things to remember when I'm down there drinking that plant stuff. 

Appreciate you helping me get the words right. Feels... I don't know. Like I've got something to hold onto now. Something to aim for.

Guess we'll see what happens.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You've got solid intentions. Trust them.

The medicine works even when you forget the words.


**paul_persona_3**: That's good to know. I'm probably gonna forget everything once I'm actually there anyway.

But maybe... maybe my body'll remember. Maybe I'll remember Amanda's face when she used to laugh at my jokes, before she started watching me like I'm about to explode.

Three weeks. Then we'll see if this stuff actually works, or if I'm just another sucker chasing miracles.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Your body remembers what matters. The medicine knows where to go.

Three weeks. You're ready.


**paul_persona_3**: Alright then. 

Guess I'll see you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_8**: See you on the other side.

**paul_persona_3**: I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... whatever's going on with me. So here I am. I can't keep going like this.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

**paul_persona_3**: Look, I don't need a compass. I need to stop waking up screaming. I need to stop scaring Amanda half to death. 

That's it. That's what I need from this.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Sleep through the night without screaming
2. Create safety for Amanda 
3. Find healing from what haunts you

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: I don't know about all this intention stuff. But yeah... I guess that's about right.

I just want to sleep. Actually sleep. Without seeing their faces when I close my eyes. Without waking up with my heart trying to punch through my chest.

And Amanda... she deserves better than this. Better than me jumping at loud noises, better than me getting all quiet and angry for no reason she can see. She married a man, not... whatever this is.

The rest of it, I don't know. I did what I had to do over there. I don't regret it. But I can't keep carrying it around like this.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night
2. I create safety for Amanda and myself
3. I release what I no longer need to carry

How do these land?


**paul_persona_3**: I sleep peacefully through the night... that one hits hard. Can't remember the last time that was true. 

The safety thing - yeah, that's important. For both of us. I hate that she has to walk on eggshells around me.

But release what I'm carrying? I don't know about that one. Some things you don't just... release. Some things you carry because you have to. Because that's what honor means.

Maybe we can work on that one.


**intentions_workflow_8**: What would feel right instead? "I carry what serves me and lay down what doesn't"? Or something else entirely?


**paul_persona_3**: I carry what serves me and lay down what doesn't... that's better. 

Still feels a little soft for what we're talking about here, but I get it. There's things I picked up over there that I need - the alertness, the focus, the ability to act when things go sideways. That stuff keeps Amanda and the kids safe here.

But the nightmares? The way I can't hear fireworks without hitting the deck? The way I see threats everywhere, even when I'm just walking through the grocery store? That stuff's killing me. Killing us.

Yeah. Let's go with that one.

**paul_persona_3**: Alright. They're saved. Good.

Now I just need this damn thing to actually work.


**intentions_workflow_8**: The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: Trust what comes... that's the part that scares me. What's coming isn't exactly pleasant most nights.


**intentions_workflow_8**: The fear makes sense. You've been fighting this alone for a long time.

The intentions are set. The medicine will meet you where you are.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah... fighting alone. That's what we do, isn't it?

I'll be there in three weeks. Whatever happens... happens.
