  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... everything. The nightmares, what it's doing to Amanda and the kids.\n\nI can't keep going like this. Waking up shouting, scaring her. She says she doesn't know who I am anymore.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Create safety for Amanda and your kids\n3. Find healing from what drives the nightmares\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are... yeah. \n\nI need to sleep without seeing it all again. Without waking up with my heart pounding like I'm back there. And I need Amanda to feel safe with me. The kids too. \n\nI just don't want to feel broken anymore.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without reliving the past\n2. I create safety and trust with Amanda and my kids\n3. I reclaim my wholeness and leave broken behind\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust anything?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest. I can't remember the last time I slept through the night without... without seeing it all again. \n\nBut I don't know about \"broken.\" I'm not broken. I'm just... I just need to figure out how to shut it off when I'm supposed to be home safe.",
  "system3": "Got it. Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without reliving the past\n2. I create safety and trust with Amanda and my kids\n3. I learn to leave the past where it belongs\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "The first two feel right. I need those.\n\nBut the third one... I don't know if I can just leave it behind. Some of those guys didn't make it back. Seems like forgetting them would be wrong somehow.",
  "system4": "Understood. Let's shift:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without reliving the past\n2. I create safety and trust with Amanda and my kids\n3. I honor what happened without letting it control my present\n\nBetter?",
  "user4": "Yeah. That feels better. I can honor them - the guys who didn't make it back. Without letting it... without it taking over everything.\n\nI need to be here for Amanda and the kids. Not just physically here, but really here.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without reliving the past\n2. I create safety and trust with Amanda and my kids\n3. I honor what happened without letting it control my present\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Alright. I'll... I'll keep these close. Maybe write them down, keep them in my wallet. Been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you.",
  "system6": "Good plan. The medicine works even when you forget the words - these intentions are already doing their work.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "I hope so. I really hope so.",
  "system7": "The hoping is part of it too. Trust what comes.",
  "user7": "Trust doesn't come easy. But I'm here. That's something, right?",
  "system8": "That's everything. Being here - that's the whole thing.",
  "user8": "Then I'm all in. Whatever this is... whatever happens... I'm here for it.",
  "system9": "That's all that's needed. You're set.",
  "user9": "Alright. Three weeks. I can do this.",
  "system10": "You can. These intentions will carry you - trust them.",
  "user10": "I will. I\u2019ll trust them.",
  "system11": "Good. You're ready.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m ready.",
  "system12": "Then you're set.",
  "user12": "Alright. Let's do this.",

Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user13": "I need to stop waking up screaming. That's the bottom line. Amanda can't keep living like this, jumping every time I bolt upright at 3 AM. I don't care what you call it - PTSD, bad dreams, whatever. I just need it to stop before I lose her.\n\nBeyond that... I guess I want to figure out how to be the man my kids think I am. Not this angry shell that flinches at loud noises.",
  "system14": "Two threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Become the steady father your kids believe you to be\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "Yeah. Those are the ones. Let's get them locked in.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I become the steady father my kids believe I am\n3. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user15": "The first one feels... I don't know, too soft? \"Peacefully\" sounds like something off a meditation app. I need something stronger. More direct.\n\nHow about: \"I stop the nightmares that steal my sleep and scare my wife.\" Same thing, but it cuts closer to the truth.\n\nThe second one's good. The third... I don't know about \"reclaim safety.\" Makes it sound like I'm some victim. I'm not unsafe - I'm the one who keeps everyone safe. Maybe something like \"I stop letting whatever happened over there poison what I've got here.\"",
  "system16": "Stronger version:\n\n1. I stop the nightmares that steal my sleep and scare my wife\n2. I become the steady father my kids believe I am  \n3. I stop letting the past poison what I have here\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user16": "These work. They're mine, not some therapist's version of what I should want. They're what I actually need to fix.\n\nLet's lock them in.",
  "system17": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I stop the nightmares that steal my sleep and scare my wife\n2. I become the steady father my kids believe I am  \n3.

  "user17": "Good. I'll keep these close. Thanks for helping me get them straight.",
  "system18": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
