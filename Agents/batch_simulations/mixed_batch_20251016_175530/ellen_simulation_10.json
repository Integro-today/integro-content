  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm... I don't know how to put this. I'm going to Ibogaine in a few weeks and I keep thinking about my grandmother. She had this quiet faith, this way of making everything feel meaningful. And here I am - sold a company, made more money than anyone needs, and I feel like I'm holding sand that just keeps slipping through my fingers.\n\nI want to find what she had. Not religion exactly, but... something that makes the achievements actually matter. Does that make sense?",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reconnecting with the grounded faith your grandmother carried\n2. Finding meaning beyond external achievements \n3. Holding onto what actually matters instead of watching it slip away\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are exactly the threads. I keep circling around them but... I guess I need something that actually sticks this time. All these retreats, all these medicines, and I'm still waking up at 5:30 checking stock prices while my kids sleep in the next room.\n\nI want to find what my grandmother knew - that there was something bigger than all this striving. But I also want to figure out what I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life. The business stuff feels hollow now, but I don't want to just... float away into some spiritual bubble either.\n\nHow do I make this real? How do I not lose whatever I find when I come back home?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the grounded wisdom my grandmother carried\n2. I live what truly matters beyond achievements\n3. I practice what I learn daily when I'm back home\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I reclaim the grounded wisdom my grandmother carried\" - that hits something in my chest. But... I don't know. \"Reclaim\" feels too soft? Like I'm asking for permission or something.\n\nMaybe \"I embody the grounded wisdom my grandmother carried\"? No, that sounds like I'm trying to be her.\n\nWhat about \"I honor and carry forward the grounded wisdom my grandmother lived\"? It's like... I want to make it active, not passive. She didn't just have faith - she lived it every day, making soup for sick neighbors, lighting candles on Friday nights, calling to check on people.\n\nI want to live like that. Not just believe something, but actually live it.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I live the grounded wisdom my grandmother embodied\"?\n\nThen the full set:\n1. I live the grounded wisdom my grandmother embodied\n2. I live what truly matters beyond achievements  \n3. I practice what I learn daily when I'm back home\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "Yes. That first one - \"I live the grounded wisdom my grandmother embodied\" - that's it. It's active, it's honoring her but making it mine too.\n\nThe second one... I keep wondering if it's too vague? \"What truly matters\" - what if I think something matters and it's just another achievement in disguise? Like if I decide what matters is starting some big foundation or something, and it just becomes another thing to succeed at?\n\nMaybe I'm overthinking this. I do that.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust the second one: \"I live what matters beyond success and status\"\n\nKeeps it concrete - you know the difference between success/status and what actually matters when you feel it.\n\nFull set:\n1. I live the grounded wisdom my grandmother embodied\n2. I live what matters beyond success and status\n3. I practice what I learn daily when I'm back home\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user4": "These feel... right. Like they actually fit in my mouth when I say them. Not too soft, not too abstract.\n\nThe second one especially - \"I live what matters beyond success and status\" - that's the line I need to keep drawing for myself. Because I know the difference when I feel it. When I'm hiking with my kids and we're just... being. No photos, no checking my phone, no thinking about the next thing. Just there. That's what matters.\n\nI want to carry these with me. Maybe write them down somewhere I'll actually see them.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I live the grounded wisdom my grandmother embodied\n2. I live what matters beyond success and status\n3. I practice what I learn daily when I'm back home\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I... I needed this. Someone to help me shape all this searching into something I can actually hold onto.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother would light those Friday night candles, how she'd close her eyes and you could just feel her go somewhere deeper. I want to find that place. And stay there, even when the world is pulling me back into this... achievement hamster wheel I've been running on.\n\nMaybe I'll write these down and keep them in my wallet. Been carrying that thing for years - seems right to keep something that actually matters close too.",
  "system6": "That's solid - keeping them where you'll see them daily. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions, but having that compass close helps.\n\nTrust what comes through. You're ready.",
  "user6": "I hope you're right. About being ready, I mean. \n\nThere's this part of me that's terrified I'll just... lose it all again. That I'll come back from Ibogaine all fired up, write some beautiful insights in my journal, and then three weeks later I'm back to checking my portfolio at red lights. \n\nBut maybe that's exactly why I need these intentions written down. Not because they'll magically make me perfect, but because they'll remind me what I'm actually aiming for when I inevitably forget.\n\nMy grandmother probably forgot sometimes too. She was human. But she always found her way back to what mattered. I can too.",
  "system7": "That's exactly it - forgetting is part of the process. The intentions aren't about perfection, they're about returning. You'll drift, then remember, then drift again. That's the work.\n\nShe found her way back. You will too.",
  "user7": "Yeah. Returning. I like that better than \"never forgetting\" or whatever impossible standard I usually set for myself.\n\nShe probably had to return a thousand times. To her faith, to her people, to herself. That's actually more honest than some perfect spiritual path, isn't it? Just... coming home, over and over.\n\nI can do that. I mean, I probably won't do it gracefully, but I can do it.",
  "system8": "Graceful isn't required. Just coming home again and again - that's the whole practice.",
  "user8": "*deep breath*\n\nOkay. I'm going to hold onto that. Coming home, again and again, even when it's messy and I'm dragging all my baggage with me.\n\nThank you. For helping me find words for what I'm actually trying to do here. I didn't even know I needed that until we started talking.",
  "system9": "You're welcome. Sometimes we just need someone to help shape what's already there into something we can carry.\n\nYou've got a solid compass now. Trust it.",
  "user9": "I will. Trust the compass, trust the process, trust myself. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.\n\nI should probably go. Need to pick up the kids from soccer practice, and I want to be there - really be there, not half-listening while checking emails. That's... that's the work, isn't it? Right there in the carpool line.\n\nThank you again. For everything.",
  "system10": "That's exactly the work - being there fully in the carpool line. The intentions live in those moments.\n\nGo be with your kids. Solid work here today.",
  "user10": "*I pause before leaving, feeling something settle in my chest*\n\nYou know what's wild? I came here thinking I needed to figure out some big cosmic thing, and instead... you helped me see that the real work is probably going to happen in my minivan between soccer practice and dinner. \n\nMy grandmother would probably laugh and say \"Of course, bubbeleh. Where else would it be?\"\n\nOkay. I'm really going now. But I'm taking this feeling with me - the one that says I can actually do this, one imperfect, beautiful day at a time.",
  "system11": "She'd laugh because she knew - the sacred shows up in minivans and dinner tables, not just mountaintops.\n\nTake that feeling. You've got this, one ordinary day at a time.",
  "user11": "One ordinary day at a time. Yeah. I can do that.\n\nThank you, truly. See you on the other side\u2014of this journey, of all of it.",
  "system12": "I'll be here when you need to reconnect with your compass. Trust the journey.",
  "user12": "I will. And I\u2019ll remember\u2014when I forget, when I drift\u2014there\u2019s a way back. Always.\n\nThank you.",
  "system13": "Always a way back. Always.\n\nGo be with your people.",
  "user13": "*deep breath, steady and clear*\n\nGoing.",
  "system14": "Good.",
  "user14": "*quiet nod*\n\nYeah. Good.",
