## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_8:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**paul_persona_3**: I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, Amanda being scared of me. I can't keep going like this.

I guess I want to stop waking up shouting. Stop feeling like I'm about to explode all the time. And... I don't know. Maybe figure out how to be the man my family thinks I am instead of whatever I've become.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Sleep without the nightmares that wake you shouting
2. Release the pressure that makes you feel ready to explode
3. Reclaim the man your family believes you to be

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Those are... yeah. That's it.

I need to sleep without seeing it all again. Need to stop this anger that's eating me alive. And I need to be worth what Amanda and the kids think I am.

How do we... how do we make these into whatever I'm supposed to carry with me?


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing it again
2. I release the anger that's eating me alive
3. I become the man my family believes I am

How do these land? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: I... I don't know. These feel... I mean, they're true, but—

The first one - "I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing it again" - that's what I want, but what if I can't? What if I see it anyway?

And the second one... "release the anger." I don't even know what that means. How do you just... release something that's been part of you for fifteen years?

The third one feels too big. Like I'm setting myself up to fail. What if I find out I'm not that man at all? What if I'm just... this?


**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's adjust:

1. I sleep without the nightmares controlling me
2. I loosen anger's grip on me
3. I discover who I am beyond what I've become

How do these feel?


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah... yeah, these feel better. More honest.

"Loosen anger's grip" - that's something I can work with. It's still there, but I'm not letting it choke me anymore.

And "discover who I am beyond what I've become" - that doesn't make me feel like I'm betraying who I was before. Just... finding out what's still there underneath all this.

I can carry these. I think I can carry these.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ All 3 locked in:

1. I sleep without the nightmares controlling me
2. I loosen anger's grip on me
3. I discover who I am beyond what I've become

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**paul_persona_3**: Alright. They're... they're in there now.

I keep thinking about what Amanda said last week - that she misses who I used to be before I got so hard all the time. Maybe this is how I find him again. Or find out if he's still in there somewhere.

Three weeks. I can hold onto these for three weeks.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three weeks is enough time. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're already doing their job by pointing you toward what matters.

Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. I'll... I'll try to trust it. Even though I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

But I've trusted worse people with worse things. These Heroic Hearts guys - they know what they're doing. And if this is what it takes to keep Amanda from looking at me like I'm a stranger in my own house...

I'll trust it.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You've found your compass. Let these three intentions carry you forward - nothing more to figure out right now.


**paul_persona_3**: Alright. No more figuring. Just... carrying these. I can do that.

Thanks for walking through this with me.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You're ready. Trust the process.


**paul_persona_3**: Copy that. See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_8**: See you there.


**paul_persona_3**: Roger that.

**paul_persona_3**: Paul here. Got three weeks before I head down to Rythmia. Not sure what I'm supposed to say about intentions—Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep without the nightmares, help me keep Amanda from looking at me like I'm a stranger in my own house. That's all I got right now.
