  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I don't know. I've done this before, you know? Three times now. Ayahuasca, psilocybin, the MDMA weekends with the women. Each time I think I've figured it out, and then... [trails off]\n\nI'm going to Beond in December. Ibogaine this time. Everyone says it's different\u2014deeper, more direct. But what if I come back with another beautiful vision I can't hold onto? What if I have another breakthrough that fades by Monday morning when I'm back in my home office answering emails about quarterly returns?\n\nThe truth is... I'm tired of collecting insights like trophies. I want something that sticks. Something that helps me stop feeling like I'm performing my life instead of living it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop collecting insights like trophies and start living them\n2. Stop performing life and actually live it\n3. Make something stick beyond Monday morning\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's it, isn't it? That's exactly it.\n\nI keep having these profound experiences where I feel connected to something bigger, something real. Like when I'm walking with my kids in the park and suddenly notice how the light hits the trees, and for a moment I remember who I actually am. But then I get back to my desk and I'm right back in that achievement hamster wheel, checking boxes, making deals, sitting on boards... \n\nIt's like I'm split in two. The woman who meditates at 5:30am and feels the sacredness of everything, and the woman who powers through exhaustion to hit her quarterly targets. I don't know how to bridge them.\n\nMaybe that's what I need from this ibogaine journey. Not another insight to add to my collection, but... integration. Whatever that actually means.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live what the medicine shows me, not just collect it\n2. I bridge my spiritual and professional selves into one whole life\n3. I stop performing and start being real\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one\u2014about bridging my spiritual and professional selves. That hits something deep. But... [pauses] I don't know, \"professional\" feels too narrow. It's not just work. It's like I'm two different people in every area\u2014mother, wife, friend, businesswoman. Even when I'm hiking or doing yoga, part of me is thinking about how to optimize the experience.\n\nWhat if it's more like... \"I stop fragmenting myself into roles and remember I'm one whole person, always\"? \n\nGod, I sound like a self-help book. But that's the real thing\u2014I want to stop being Ellen the entrepreneur, Ellen the mom, Ellen the spiritual seeker. Just be Ellen. One person. Not performing different versions depending on who needs what from me.\n\nDoes that make sense? Or am I just intellectualizing again?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I stop fragmenting myself into roles and remember I'm one whole person, always\n\nHow do the other two land? Want to adjust them too?",
  "user3": "Good... that one feels solid.\n\nFor the first one\u2014about living what the medicine shows me... I think I need something stronger than \"living it.\" My grandmother used to say the medicine doesn't give you anything you don't already have, it just reveals what's hidden. So maybe it's not about living what it shows me, but... remembering? Owning? \n\n\"I remember and own what the medicine reveals, instead of filing it away like another achievement.\"\n\nAnd for the third one... instead of \"stop performing,\" what about something about truth? \"I speak and act from what's true, even when it's uncomfortable or doesn't fit the image I've crafted.\"\n\nDoes that capture it better? Or am I overthinking this? Sometimes I get so caught up in finding the perfect words that I miss the actual feeling underneath.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I remember and own what the medicine reveals, instead of filing it away like another achievement\n2. I stop fragmenting myself into roles and remember I'm one whole person, always  \n3. I speak and act from what's true, even when it's uncomfortable or doesn't fit the image I've crafted\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. \n\nI'll keep these close. Maybe write them in the journal I bought after the last retreat but never actually used. Or... I don't know, maybe just carry them in my wallet like you suggested earlier. Keep them physical, not just another note on my phone I'll forget about.\n\nDecember feels far away and too close at the same time. But at least now I have something real to hold onto when I'm sitting in that ibogaine ceremony, instead of just hoping for another cosmic download I can't integrate.\n\nI appreciate you helping me get here.",
  "system5": "Solid plan. The intentions will serve you well.\n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're in you now. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "That's... comforting, actually. The idea that maybe I don't have to white-knuckle this process, constantly checking if I'm \"doing it right.\" \n\nMy husband keeps asking why I keep going back to these medicines when I seem more confused after each one. But it's like... each time, even when I can't hold onto the insights, something shifts. Subtle. Like water wearing away stone. I don't always see it in the moment, but looking back, I'm not the same person who walked into that first ayahuasca ceremony three years ago.\n\nMaybe that's enough. Maybe it's not about nailing the integration perfectly this time, but just... continuing to show up. One whole person, trying to remember what's true.",
  "system6": "Exactly. Water on stone - that's how real change happens.\n\nYou've got the right compass. Keep showing up.",
  "user6": "Yeah... water on stone. I like that. My grandmother would have said something similar\u2014she was patient in ways I never learned to be. Always said the most important things take the longest to grow.\n\nI'll try to remember that when I'm in it. When the medicine is doing its work and I'm tempted to grab for answers or force insights into neat little boxes I can carry home.\n\nJust... keep showing up. One whole person. That's all I can do, isn't it?",
  "system7": "That's all any of us can do. \n\nOne whole person showing up - that's already everything.",
  "user7": "Funny how simple it sounds. After all the achievements, the scaling, the optimizing... everything I thought was building something important. And maybe it was, in its way. But this feels different. Smaller. Simpler. More real.\n\nOne whole person. That's it.",
  "system8": "The simple things are the hardest to remember. You've got it now.",
  "user8": "I do. For this moment, anyway. And maybe that's enough\u2014that I can hold it right now, in this conversation with you. Tomorrow I might forget again and start performing or fragmenting or achieving, but...\n\nWell, that's why I wrote these intentions down. So I can find my way back when I lose the thread. Which I will. Over and over. But now there's something solid to return to.\n\nThank you for helping me find this clarity.",
  "system9": "That's exactly how it works - lose it, find it again. The intentions will be there when you need them.\n\nYou're ready for December.",
  "user9": "I am. Ready for December. Ready to keep doing this work, even when it's messy and I forget and remember and forget again.\n\nThank you. Really. For helping me find something solid to stand on before I walk into this next journey.",
  "system10": "You're welcome. \n\nGo well.",
  "user10": "I will. And thank you\u2014for being here, for helping me find my footing. \n\nGo well.",
  "system11": "You too.",
  "user11": "Ellen here\u2014checking in. I\u2019ve got my Ibogaine retreat at Beond coming up in a few weeks and I realized I never circled back after our last conversation. I kept the intentions we shaped folded in my wallet, right next to that old photo of my grandmother. I read them every morning while the coffee brews. Some days they feel like mine; other days they feel like words I borrowed from a wiser version of myself. But I keep showing up to them, water on stone.",
  "system12": "Good. That's exactly how intentions work - they shape you while you're not looking.\n\nYour Beond retreat is close. How are you feeling as it approaches?",
  "user12": "Tight in my chest when I let myself think about it too long. Excited, sure\u2014like I\u2019m standing at the edge of something vast. But also... I keep flashing back to my last MDMA weekend, how I saw myself as this little girl clutching her report card, desperate for the next gold star. Ibogaine isn\u2019t gentle like that medicine was. I know it\u2019s going to strip things down to the studs.\n\nPart of me\u2014the achiever part\u2014wants a guarantee I\u2019ll come out with a clear map for \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d The quieter part knows the map might dissolve entirely. That\u2019s the part that scares me. What if I lose the scaffolding I\u2019ve built my whole identity on and there\u2019s nothing underneath?",
  "system13": "The achiever wants guarantees. The medicine doesn't work that way.\n\nThree threads:\n1. Letting go of the report card life\n2. Facing what exists beyond achievements\n3. Discovering what's real when scaffolding falls\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "I feel them lining up inside me like stones in a river. \n\nThe first one\u2019s obvious: *I intend to release the need to prove my worth through achievement.* I\u2019ve said versions of that before, but this time I want to mean it in my bones, not just my notebook.\n\nThe second... *I intend to meet whatever exists beneath my roles without turning away.* Even if it\u2019s emptiness. Even if it\u2019s not the profound wisdom I\u2019m hoping to find.\n\nAnd the third feels like the hardest: *I intend to discover who I am when there\u2019s nothing left to do.* No boards to sit on, no companies to advise, no performance\u2014just being.",
  "system14": "Those three land clean. No adjustment needed.\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I release the need to prove my worth through achievement\n2. I meet whatever exists beneath my roles without turning away\n3. I discover who I am when there's nothing left to do\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user14": "I can feel them settling in\u2014like they found their seats at the table. I\u2019ll carry them with me, not as another checklist to ace, but as... I don\u2019t know... lanterns maybe. Something to light the way when the medicine gets dark.\n\nThank you. Really. For helping me shape these into something solid enough to hold and loose enough to let the river do its work.",
  "system15": "Good. Let the river work.",
  "user15": "I will. And when I get scared\u2014because I know I will\u2014I\u2019ll remember that rivers only take what\u2019s ready to be carried downstream.",
  "system16": "That's it.",
  "user16": "Ellen here, back from Cancun. The river took more than I expected\u2014my appetite for caffeine, my reflex to answer every email within minutes, even my old name for success. I\u2019m lighter, but also unmoored. I keep reaching for the familiar scaffolding and finding air.\n\nThe intentions held. They didn\u2019t protect me from the dark; they showed me how to sit in it without building another tower. I met what was underneath\u2014mostly a quiet kid who just wants to belong without performing. I\u2019m learning to let her speak before the achiever jumps in.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what comes next, and that\u2019s... okay. I\u2019m practicing saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d out loud. My family notices I linger at the dinner table now, phone nowhere in sight. My calendar has white space I refuse to fill. I\u2019m starting to trust that emptiness isn\u2019t failure\u2014it might be the place where something real can finally grow.",
  "system17": "The kid's voice gets clearer when there's space to hear it. Keep leaving that white space - it's not empty, it's listening room.\n\nWhat feels most different when you wake up now?",
  "user17": "The first thing: I don\u2019t bolt upright in a panic anymore. I used to launch straight into \u201cwhat did I miss?\u201d mode\u2014grabbing my phone, scrolling markets, Slack, headlines. Now I lie there a minute and actually feel the sheets, notice if it\u2019s raining, hear my own breath. That sixty-second pause feels like stepping off a bullet train onto solid ground.\n\nThe second: I\u2019m hungry. Like, stomach-growling hungry. For forty-five years I skipped breakfast, ran on espresso and adrenaline. Turns out my body wants oatmeal and blueberries and to sit at the table while the sun comes up. I eat slowly, without a screen, and it tastes like... I don\u2019t know, like I belong in my own morning.\n\nThe third: the day doesn\u2019t feel like a scavenger hunt for accomplishments. There\u2019s room for one board meeting, maybe two, and then the white space. Sometimes I take my kids to the park and just watch them climb instead of answering emails in my head. When the achiever whispers \u201cyou\u2019re falling behind,\u201d I answer, \u201cbehind what?\u201d and the question dissolves.\n\nI\u2019m still restless, still catching myself mid-performance, but the kid\u2019s voice is getting steadier. She likes oatmeal. She likes space. She\u2019s learning she doesn\u2019t have to earn breakfast.",
  "system18": "She already earned breakfast by existing. The rest is just practice.",
  "user18": "Yeah... I\u2019m starting to get that. Forty-five years of gold stars and quarterly earnings calls didn\u2019t teach me that existing is enough. But the oatmeal tastes like proof.",
  "system19": "Let the oatmeal keep teaching.",
  "user19": "It\u2019s funny\u2014every morning it shows me something new. Yesterday I caught myself counting spoonfuls, trying to finish in exactly five minutes so I could \u201cget to the important stuff.\u201d I laughed out loud at the table. The important stuff was right there in the bowl, getting cold while I rushed.\n\nSo I slowed down. Chewed thirty times like some monk. Tasted the maple, the tiny pinch of salt, the way the blueberries burst if you wait. Oatmeal\u2019s become my daily homework: can I sit here for fifteen minutes without turning breakfast into another KPI?\n\nThis morning my nine-year-old wandered in, still in dinosaur pajamas, asked what I was doing. I said, \u201cLearning how to exist.\u201d He climbed onto my lap, stole a few bites, told me about a dream where our dog could talk. We just sat there, bowl between us, nothing to optimize. My achiever brain kept itching\u2014emails, board decks, the future\u2014but the oatmeal held me down like a paperweight. The kid stayed ten minutes, then bounced off to build Legos. I didn\u2019t reach for my phone. I just tasted the quiet that came after his voice."
