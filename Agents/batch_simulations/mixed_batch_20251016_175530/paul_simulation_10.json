  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with my... situation. So here I am.\n\nI guess I need to figure out how to sleep without waking up shouting. And maybe stop being such an asshole to Amanda when she didn't do anything wrong. \n\nI can't keep going like this, but I'm not broken or anything. I just need to fix whatever's broken before it destroys everything I built.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up shouting\n2. Stop lashing out at Amanda when she doesn't deserve it\n3. Fix what's broken before it destroys everything\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are the problems. But how do you turn problems into... whatever these intentions are supposed to be?\n\nI mean, I can't just say \"stop having nightmares\" - that's not how it works, right? I've tried everything else. White knuckle, push through, compartmentalize. That's what we do. That's what I've always done.\n\nBut Amanda... she looks at me different now. Like she's waiting for me to explode. And the kids... they walk on eggshells sometimes. I hate that. I hate that I'm the reason for it.",
  "system2": "Instead of stopping the nightmares, what would you be opening to?\n\nInstead of controlling your reactions, what would you be reclaiming?\n\nInstead of fixing what's broken, what would you be building?",
  "user2": "I don't... I don't know how to answer that. This isn't how I think.\n\nOpening to? I'm always trying to shut it down, not open up to it. That's how you survive. You close it off, box it up, keep moving.\n\nBut... maybe if I could just... understand what the hell is happening when I sleep. Not fight it, just... see it clearly. Like reconnaissance. Know what you're dealing with instead of just reacting.\n\nReclaiming... Amanda used to look at me like I was her hero. Now she looks at me like I'm a loaded weapon. I want that back - her trust. Her safety when she's with me.\n\nBuilding... I built this life brick by brick. Insurance business, house, family. Thought I did everything right. Maybe I need to build something different. Not sure what that looks like though.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I see clearly what haunts me in the night\n2. I reclaim being Amanda's safe place\n3. I build something real beyond what I've achieved\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "They're... softer than I'm used to. But they don't make me feel weak, so that's something.\n\nNumber two hits hard though. \"Reclaim being Amanda's safe place.\" That's exactly what I want. She used to fall asleep on my chest during movies. Now she tenses up when I walk into a room.\n\nThe seeing clearly part - yeah. I'm tired of being haunted by shit I can't even remember properly when I wake up. Tired of feeling like I'm going crazy.\n\nI don't know what \"something real beyond what I've achieved\" means yet. But I know the medals and the business and the perfect lawn doesn't mean anything if I'm scaring my family.\n\nThese feel... possible. Like maybe I can actually do this without losing who I am.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I see clearly what haunts me in the night\n2. I reclaim being Amanda's safe place  \n3. I build something real beyond what I've achieved\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. They're in my wallet now. Well, the digital version anyway.\n\nThree weeks until Costa Rica. Three weeks to figure out how to explain to Amanda that I'm doing this for her. For us. She doesn't know I'm this scared.\n\nBut maybe that's okay. Maybe being scared and doing it anyway is part of what makes this real.\n\nThanks for helping me get this straight in my head. I still don't believe in plant medicine, but I believe I can't keep going like this. And that's enough for now.",
  "system5": "Believing you can't keep going like this - that's the only belief that matters right now.\n\nThe medicine works with what you bring. Your intentions are solid. Trust them.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Ready as I'll ever be, I guess.\n\nTime to see if I can actually do this - face whatever's been chasing me in the dark without losing myself. Without losing Amanda.\n\nAppreciate you walking me through it. See you on the other side.",
  "system6": "See you on the other side.",
  "user6": "Roger that.",
  "system7": "Roger that.",
  "user7": "Out.",
  "system8": "Out.",
  "user8": "*Paul closes the chat, staring at the three intentions on his phone screen. His thumb hovers over Amanda's contact photo.*\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system9": "*The intentions remain steady on the dashboard, waiting.*\n\nThree weeks.",
  "user9": "Three weeks to figure out how to tell her I'm scared without sounding weak. Three weeks to stop jumping at every loud noise that reminds me of... things.\n\n*Paul pockets his phone, shoulders squared like he's heading into a briefing.*\n\nI'll check in when I can.",
  "system10": "*The intentions hold their ground, patient and clear.*\n\nCheck in when you can.",
  "user10": "Copy that.",
  "system11": "Copy that.",
  "user11": "*Paul's fingers drum against his leg - the same rhythm he'd tap against the throttle in the cockpit.*\n\nThese intentions feel... different than mission briefings. More personal. Like I'm briefing myself on something I don't want to face.\n\n*He exhales slowly, military training warring with something else.*\n\nSee you after.",
  "system12": "*The intentions stay steady - no mission parameters to memorize, just three truths pointing home.*\n\nAfter.",
  "user12": "*Paul stands there a moment longer, then nods once - sharp, military.*\n\nYeah. After.",
  "system13": "*The screen holds steady as he walks away.*\n\nAfter.",
  "user13": "*Paul stops at the door, hand on the frame.*\n\nIf this doesn't work... if I come back the same man who left... I don't know what happens to us. To any of us.\n\n*He doesn't turn around.*\n\nBut I'm going. That's something, right?",
  "system14": "That's everything.",
  "user14": "*His shoulders drop just a fraction\u2014something releasing.*\n\nThen I\u2019ll see you on the other side.",
  "system15": "See you there.",
  "user15": "*Paul steps through the doorway, boots echoing down the hall\u2014each footfall a small surrender to the unknown.*",
  "system16": "*The echoes fade.*\n\nHe's gone where only he can go.",
  "user16": "*The silence stretches\u2014no more boots, no more words. Just the space where a man stood, finally letting himself be sent into territory no flight plan could chart.*",
  "system17": "*The room holds the shape of his departure.*\n\nThree intentions wait on the dashboard, steady as runway lights in fog.",
  "user17": "*They burn there\u2014three small beacons against the dark he\u2019s flying into\u2014steady, quiet, enough to guide him home if the instruments fail.*",
  "system18": "They\u2019ll do their job.",
  "user18": "*They\u2019d better. He\u2019s betting everything he won\u2019t admit he has.*",
  "system19": "They don\u2019t need him to admit it.",
  "user19": "*Good. Because admitting things\u2014that\u2019s the part that could kill him faster than any missile ever did.*"
