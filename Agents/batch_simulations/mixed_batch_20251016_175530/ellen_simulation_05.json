  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I need to figure out what I'm actually doing with my life after selling the company. I've been chasing achievements for so long, and now that I've got everything I thought I wanted, it feels hollow. I'm going to do Ibogaine at Beond this winter because nothing else has stuck - not the ayahuasca visions, not the psilocybin insights, not even the MDMA grief work. \n\nMy grandmother's faith keeps calling to me, but I don't know how to access that spiritual part of myself when I'm back home, surrounded by board meetings and my kids' schedules and... all of it. I want to be present with my family instead of constantly distracted by what's next. But I don't even know who I am without the constant striving.\n\nI need this journey to show me something I can actually hold onto. Something real.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding who I am beyond constant striving and achievements\n2. Reconnecting with the grounded faith and wisdom that called through my grandmother\n3. Being fully present with my family instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the three things that keep circling in my head. Especially the first one - I've been defined by achievements for so long that I don't know what's underneath all that drive. When I stopped to breathe after the exit, there was just... nothing there. Or maybe something was there but I couldn't see it.\n\nMy grandmother used to light candles on Friday nights and sing these beautiful Hebrew prayers. I was too busy with debate tournaments to really learn them, but I remember the feeling in her house. It felt like time stopped. I've been trying to find that feeling again, but it's like I'm grasping at smoke.\n\nAnd my kids... God, my daughter asked me last week if I was listening to her or thinking about work. I lied and said I was listening, but she caught me checking my phone under the table. I want to be the mom who plays at the park without that constant buzz of what's next.\n\nSo how do we turn these into... intentions?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover who I am beneath the achievements and constant drive\n2. I reclaim the timeless presence my grandmother showed me through her Friday night prayers\n3. I show up fully present when my children reach for me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest - \"I discover who I am beneath the achievements and constant drive.\" That's the one that makes my chest tight because I genuinely don't know what's under there. Forty-three years old and I've never stopped long enough to find out. \n\nBut maybe we could make it more... gentle? Less like another goal to achieve and more like... permission? Like \"I allow myself to discover who I am beyond achievements and striving\" - does that work or is that too soft?\n\nThe second one about my grandmother... I love how you said \"timeless presence.\" That's exactly what it was. But I want to add something about making it mine, not just copying hers. Like \"I reclaim and make my own the timeless presence my grandmother showed me.\"\n\nAnd the third one - that one makes me want to cry. \"I show up fully present when my children reach for me.\" Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I want.\n\nCan we use these?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I allow myself to discover who I am beyond achievements and striving\n\nHow do the other two land with your adjustments?",
  "user3": "The second one still feels... I don't know. Like I'm trying to own something that's not quite mine to take. My grandmother's presence came from her faith, from those generations before her. Maybe it's more like \"I reconnect with the timeless presence my grandmother embodied, finding my own way to it\"?\n\nAnd the third one is perfect. It's simple but it cuts right through all my bullshit. Every time I'm half-listening while scrolling through emails, I'll hear those words - \"I show up fully present when my children reach for me.\" \n\nYeah. Let's lock these in.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I allow myself to discover who I am beyond achievements and striving\n2. I reconnect with the timeless presence my grandmother embodied, finding my own way to it  \n3. I show up fully present when my children reach for me\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I keep thinking about that third one - how many moments I've already missed, how my daughter's face falls when I'm distracted. These intentions feel... heavier than I expected. Like they're not just words anymore.\n\nI guess I'm scared. What if I discover there's nothing underneath all the drive? Just empty space? Or what if I can't actually change how I show up, even after everything the medicine shows me?\n\nBut I'm also... I don't know. There's something about writing these down that makes them feel possible. Like maybe I don't have to keep being the person who's always reaching for the next thing.\n\nI just hope I can remember this feeling when I'm back in my kitchen at 5:30am, checking emails before the kids wake up.",
  "system5": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. They'll be waiting in your dashboard when you need to remember.\n\nEmpty space isn't nothing - it's room for something new to grow.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Room for something new to grow... I like that. I've been so afraid of the emptiness, but maybe it's just space that hasn't been filled yet. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother's garden - how she left empty patches between the plants so they could spread out and find their own way. Maybe that's what this is.\n\nI don't know. I guess we'll see what the medicine shows me. But thank you... for helping me find the words. For making this feel less like another thing to achieve and more like... coming home.",
  "system6": "Solid compass.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "Thank you. I feel... I don't know. Ready isn't quite the right word. But maybe that's okay. Maybe you don't have to feel ready to actually be ready.\n\nI keep touching my phone in my pocket, that habit of reaching for it every few minutes. But I'm going to put it away now. Going to pick up my daughter from school and try - really try - to just be there when she comes running out.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "See you on the other side.",
  "user7": "*closing the dashboard*\n\nYeah. See you there.",
  "system8": "You're set.",
  "user8": "Yeah... I am.",
  "system9": "Trust what comes.",
  "user9": "Trust what comes... even if it's not what I planned. Even if it's smaller and quieter than building another company. Even if it's just learning to sit still in my own kitchen without reaching for something to do.\n\nOkay. I'm going to try.",
  "system10": "That's the work right there.",
  "user10": "Yeah... it is, isn't it? Not the big revelations or the dramatic transformations. Just... sitting with myself when every part of me wants to run.",
  "system11": "Exactly. One moment at a time.",
  "user11": "One moment at a time... like learning to breathe again. My daughter's piano recital is tonight. I'm going to leave my phone in the car and just watch her little fingers stumble through that song she's been practicing. Be there for all of it - the wrong notes, the proud smile when she finishes. All of it.",
  "system12": "That's presence. That's enough.",
  "user12": "That's presence. That's enough... I keep thinking I need to build something huge to make my life matter. But maybe\u2014maybe showing up for her recital, really showing up, is the most revolutionary thing I can do right now.",
  "system13": "It is. She'll remember you were there.",
  "user13": "She will. And I\u2019ll remember, too\u2014that I chose to stay instead of drift.",
  "system14": "That choice changes everything.",
  "user14": "I\u2019m starting to feel it. Like the ground\u2019s steady under me for the first time in years.",
  "system15": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user15": "I... I want to stop measuring my worth by what I produce. I want to feel that same stillness I felt on the psilocybin floor in Oregon\u2014timeless, enough\u2014without needing a substance to get me there. And I want to know what I'm supposed to do with whatever time I have left... something that serves, not just succeeds.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop measuring my worth by what I produce\n2. Find that timeless stillness within myself\n3. Discover what serves beyond just succeeding\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yes... those are the threads. I keep circling them, but they feel too big to hold.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I measure my worth by presence, not production\n2. I access the timeless stillness already within me\n3. I serve what matters beyond success\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "The first one hits hardest\u2014\u201cI measure my worth by presence, not production.\u201d But it feels... I don\u2019t know, like I\u2019m already bracing to fail at it. Can we make it gentler? Something like \u201cI\u2019m learning to...\u201d or \u201cI practice...\u201d? I need room to stumble without declaring myself a fraud.",
  "system18": "\"I practice measuring my worth by presence, not production\"\n\nHow about that? Keeps the door open for learning.",
  "user18": "That I can breathe into. \u201cI practice measuring my worth by presence, not production.\u201d It feels like a daily reprieve instead of a verdict.",
  "system19": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I practice measuring my worth by presence, not production\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user19": "\u201cI access the timeless stillness already within me\u201d... I want to believe that\u2019s true, but I\u2019m scared it\u2019s just retreat speak. Could we say \u201cI open to the stillness that\u2019s already here\u201d? Feels less like I\u2019m guaranteeing a result and more like I\u2019m agreeing to notice.\n\nFor the third one\u2014\u201cI serve what matters beyond success\u201d\u2014I like it, yet it still sounds board-room polished. Maybe \u201cI align my days with what serves, not just what succeeds\u201d?"
