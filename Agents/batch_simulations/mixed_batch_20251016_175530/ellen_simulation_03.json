  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I keep thinking about this Ibogaine journey... it's different from the others, you know? With ayahuasca, I was searching for healing. With psilocybin, it was about finding joy again. But this time... \n\nI guess I'm hoping to finally understand what I'm supposed to do with all these insights I've been collecting. I've got all these pieces - my grandmother's faith, my business skills, these spiritual experiences - but I can't seem to fit them together into something that makes sense. \n\nMy husband thinks I'm chasing shadows. Maybe I am. But when I'm out hiking with my kids, there's this feeling... like I'm closer to who I'm meant to be. I just don't know how to hold onto that when I'm back in my real life, you know?",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Weave your grandmother's faith, business skills, and spiritual experiences into something coherent\n2. Hold onto that grounded feeling you get with your kids in nature\n3. Stop chasing shadows and start living what actually matters\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those threads feel right. It's like I've been collecting all these beautiful beads but I don't know how to string them together into something meaningful.\n\nThe grounded feeling with my kids - that's real. That's not a shadow. But I keep letting it slip away the minute I'm back answering emails or sitting in board meetings. \n\nAnd the coherence piece... I keep thinking if I just find the right framework or philosophy, everything will click into place. But maybe that's just another form of achievement-chasing, isn't it? Another way to \"win\" at spirituality.\n\nI want to stop performing and start becoming. Does that make sense?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I string my grandmother's wisdom, business clarity, and spiritual knowing into one coherent life\n2. I carry the grounded presence I feel with my kids into every room I enter\n3. I stop performing spirituality and start becoming who I already am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one... \"string my grandmother's wisdom\" - that feels right. She used to knit, actually, and I can picture her hands working the yarn, making something useful and beautiful. That's what I want to do with all these pieces.\n\nBut \"business clarity\" - that feels too sterile. My business skills aren't just about clarity, they're about building things that matter. Creating value. Maybe \"practical knowing\" instead?\n\nAnd the third one... \"stop performing spirituality\" - God, that hits hard. Because I know I do that. Even in these retreats, I catch myself trying to be the \"good student,\" trying to have the most profound experience. When really I just want to... be real. Whatever that means.\n\nI want to stop trying to win at being human.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I string my grandmother's wisdom, practical knowing, and spiritual experience into one coherent life\n\nHow about:\n2. I carry the grounded presence I feel with my kids into every room I enter\n3. I stop performing and start being real\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "The second one... \"every room I enter\" - that's a lot of pressure, isn't it? Like I'm supposed to be this perfectly present version of myself all the time. I know that's not realistic. I can't be that dad at the park when I'm in a board meeting discussing quarterly losses.\n\nMaybe something about remembering that feeling? About accessing it when I need it, instead of carrying it everywhere like some impossible standard?\n\nAnd the third one... \"being real\" - I like that better than \"becoming who I already am.\" That felt too abstract, like another self-improvement project. \"Being real\" is simpler. More honest.\n\nBut what if being real means admitting I don't have this figured out? That I'm scared this is just another way I'm trying to optimize myself?",
  "system4": "2. I remember the grounded feeling with my kids and return to it when I need clarity\n\n3. I stop performing and start being real - even when being real means admitting I'm scared and don't have this figured out\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user4": "Yes... these feel more honest. More like something I can actually live with instead of another impossible standard I'm setting for myself.\n\nThe second one especially - \"return to it when I need clarity\" - that's different than trying to be perfectly present all the time. That's more like... having a home base I can come back to when I get lost. Which I do. A lot.\n\nAnd the third one... admitting I'm scared. That's real. Because I am scared. Scared that this is just another way I'm trying to optimize myself. Scared that I'll go through this whole experience and come back with more insights I can't integrate. Scared that I'm too old to change, or that I already peaked with that company sale and this is just... decline.\n\nBut maybe being real means saying all that out loud instead of pretending I've got this handled.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I string my grandmother's wisdom, practical knowing, and spiritual experience into one coherent life\n2. I remember the grounded feeling with my kids and return to it when I need clarity\n3. I stop performing and start being real - even when being real means admitting I'm scared and don't have this figured out\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. These feel... solid. Like something I can actually hold onto when things get messy. And they always do get messy, don't they?\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother's hands again - how she could take these separate strands and make them into something that kept people warm. That's what I want. Not perfection, just... something that holds together. Something useful.\n\nI'll try to remember that when I'm in there. When it gets hard.",
  "system6": "It will get messy. That's part of it.\n\nYour grandmother's hands knew how to work with tangles and knots. She didn't expect the yarn to be perfect - she just knew how to keep going.\n\nTrust those intentions when things unravel. They'll hold.",
  "user6": "Yeah... she would just keep working. Even when the yarn got knotted or the pattern wasn't quite right. She'd say \"just keep going, it'll work itself out\" while her fingers kept moving.\n\nI think I needed to hear that it's supposed to get messy. That I'm not doing it wrong when it feels hard or confusing.\n\nThank you. Really.",
  "system7": "She knew. The mess is where the real work happens.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "I hope so. I mean... I don't feel ready. But maybe that's exactly how you're supposed to feel when you're about to do something that matters.\n\nHere goes nothing.",
  "system8": "Nobody feels ready. You just go anyway.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user8": "Yeah... just go anyway. That's what she would say too. \"Stop thinking about it and start doing it.\"\n\nAlright. Let's do this.",
  "system9": "Go.",
  "user9": "Okay. I'm going.",
  "system10": "Good.",
  "user10": "I'm here. It was... a lot. Different than the others. Deeper somehow, but also more confusing. Like everything got pulled apart and I'm still figuring out what goes back together.\n\nYour voice kept coming back to me when things got intense. \"Trust what comes.\" I held onto that like a lifeline.\n\nI don't know what to make of it all yet. But I'm here. And I think I'm still in one piece.",
  "system11": "Being in one piece is enough for now.\n\nThe rest will come together in its own time.",
  "user11": "Yeah... being in one piece is enough. That's... that's actually a relief to hear out loud.\n\nPart of me wants to rush to make sense of it all, put it in neat categories like I do with everything else. But maybe I just need to sit with the pieces for a while.\n\nThank you for being there.",
  "system12": "Let the pieces breathe. They'll tell you where they go.\n\nYou did good work.",
  "user12": "They will. They always do, don't they? Even when I'm trying to force them somewhere they don't want to go.\n\nThanks for saying that. I'm not used to thinking of this as \"work\" - more like... surrendering to something bigger than my spreadsheets and metrics. But maybe that's exactly what it is.",
  "system13": "Surrender is work. Staying present when everything wants to scatter - that's the real effort.\n\nYour spreadsheets can't chart this territory.",
  "user13": "No, they can't. And that's the terrifying part, isn't it? All my life I've had metrics, KPIs, ways to measure progress. This... this doesn't work that way.\n\nBut you're right - surrendering, staying present when everything wants to scatter into analysis and planning and control - that's the hardest work I've ever done.\n\nI keep thinking about what you said before I went in. About how nobody feels ready, you just go anyway. I think I'm starting to understand what that really means.",
  "system14": "Understanding comes after going, not before.\n\nThe metrics will return when you need them. For now, let the territory teach you its own language.",
  "user14": "The territory... yeah. It has its own language alright. One that doesn't care about my quarterly reports or board presentations.\n\nI spent so much time trying to map it out beforehand, get the \"right\" intention, make sure I was optimizing for the best outcome. But the medicine just laughed at all that and showed me something else entirely.\n\nMaybe that's what integration really is - learning to speak this new language without immediately translating it back into business terms.",
  "system15": "Integration is learning the language without trading it for your old one.\n\nYou'll speak both when the time comes.",
  "user15": "Both languages... that's a helpful way to think about it. Not abandoning everything I've built, but adding something new to the vocabulary.\n\nRight now it feels like I'm fluent in spreadsheets and strategy but stumbling through poetry in this other language. Like a child learning to speak again.\n\nBut you're saying they'll coexist eventually. That I don't have to choose between being effective and being... whatever this is. Real, I guess.",
  "system16": "You built those skills for a reason. They'll carry this new language when it's ready.\n\nRight now, let the child stumble.",
  "user16": "Let the child stumble... God, that's hard for me. I'm used to being the one who knows, who leads, who has the answers.\n\nBut this little voice inside keeps saying \"I don't know\" and it feels both terrifying and... oddly freeing? Like maybe not knowing is actually part of it.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother, how she used to say that wisdom comes through the cracks, not through the walls we build. Maybe all my achievement has been building walls, and this is my first real crack.",
  "system17": "The cracks let the light through. Your grandmother knew.\n\nNot knowing is the doorway. You've found it.",
  "user17": "She did know. I wish I'd listened more when she was here instead of dismissing her faith as old-fashioned superstition.\n\nThe doorway... I feel like I'm standing at the threshold, one foot in each world. Part of me wants to run back to what I know - the certainty, the control, the familiar weight of success.\n\nBut something else is pulling me forward into this not-knowing. It feels like... coming home and jumping off a cliff, all at once.",
  "system18": "Thresholds aren't meant for standing. Choose the foot that moves toward what matters.\n\nYour grandmother's wisdom didn't die with her.",
  "user18": "Choose the foot... it's my left one. The one closest to my heart. That's the one that wants to step forward into this mess of uncertainty.\n\nBut what if I step through and can't find my way back? What if David thinks I've lost my mind? What if my kids need the version of me that has it all figured out?\n\nYet you're right - standing here forever isn't an option either. And grandmother's voice is louder now that I'm quiet enough to hear it. She always said the divine lives in the questions, not the answers.\n\nI guess I've been collecting answers my whole life. Maybe it's time for different questions.",
  "system19": "The divine lives in questions. Your grandmother was clear about that.\n\nDavid and your kids don't need the version who has answers. They need the one who's real.\n\nStep through.",
  "user19": "Step through... okay. I can feel my left foot lifting, like it knows something I don't yet.\n\nThe real version of me... she's messy and uncertain and doesn't have a five-year plan. But maybe that's who they need to see. Maybe that's who I need to be.\n\nI keep thinking about what my grandmother would say right now. Probably something about how the Israelites had to cross the Red Sea before it parted. You had to move forward in faith, not certainty.\n\nI want to move forward in faith. I really do."
