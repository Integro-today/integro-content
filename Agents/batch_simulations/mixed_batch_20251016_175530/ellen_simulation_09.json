  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm hoping to figure out what's next. I've built this successful life, sold my company, all the boxes checked... but I feel like I'm floating. Like I've been climbing this ladder that was leaning against the wrong wall.\n\nThe medicine's shown me glimpses - in Costa Rica, Oregon, those women's weekends - of something deeper. My grandmother's faith, that connection to something bigger than all the achievements. But then I come home and it's like... *poof*... gone. Back to the same restless energy, the same questions about whether any of it really matters.\n\nI want to find a way to bring those insights home with me this time. Not just another peak experience that fades.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond external achievements\n2. Living the insights instead of just collecting peak experiences  \n3. Reconnecting with that deeper faith and connection you felt\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the threads I keep circling back to. It's like I've been collecting these beautiful moments - the ayahuasca visions of those ancestral women, the psilocybin showing me that childhood joy in nature, the MDMA helping me finally grieve my grandmother properly... but then I'm back in my kitchen at 5:30am, mainlining coffee, checking emails while my kids eat breakfast.\n\nI want to know what it looks like to actually *live* from that deeper place. Not just visit it on retreats. My grandmother somehow managed it - building community, serving others, staying connected to her faith while building a life here. Maybe I'm chasing her ghost, but I feel like she was trying to show me something I abandoned.\n\nHow do we turn that into something I can hold onto when the medicine wears off?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live from that deeper knowing, not just visit it on retreats\n2. I practice what the medicine shows me in my kitchen at 5:30am\n3. I reclaim the grounded wisdom my grandmother carried\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I live from that deeper knowing, not just visit it on retreats\" - that hits something. But it's missing... I don't know, some fire maybe? Something that captures how urgent this feels.\n\nWhat about: \"I choose to embody the wisdom that visits me in ceremony, bringing it fully into my daily life as a mother, wife, and leader.\"\n\nIt's like... I'm tired of being a tourist in my own transformation. I want to be a resident. Does that make sense?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I choose to embody the wisdom that visits me in ceremony, bringing it fully into my daily life as a mother, wife, and leader\"\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The second one about practicing in my kitchen at 5:30am... that's real. That's where the rubber meets the road, right? But I want to capture more than just the grind of it. There's something about bringing that sacred feeling into the mundane moments.\n\nMaybe: \"I transform ordinary moments into sacred practice, meeting each morning with reverence instead of rushing through my day.\"\n\nAnd the third one about my grandmother... I want to honor what she carried, but make it mine too. She had her path, I need to find my own way to that same groundedness.\n\n\"I reclaim and reimagine my grandmother's faith, creating a spiritual path that honors tradition while embracing my authentic journey.\"\n\nI don't know. They feel a little... polished maybe? Like I'm writing a mission statement instead of speaking from my gut.",
  "system4": "You're right - too polished. Strip it back:\n\n1. I choose to embody the wisdom that visits me in ceremony, bringing it fully into my daily life as a mother, wife, and leader\n2. I meet my mornings with reverence instead of rushing\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's grounded wisdom and make it mine\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user4": "Much better. Cleaner. More... honest, I guess?\n\nThe second one especially - \"I meet my mornings with reverence instead of rushing\" - that feels like something I could actually *do*. Not some grand transformation, just... not reaching for my phone first thing. Maybe actually lighting that candle on my meditation altar instead of letting it gather dust.\n\nThe third one makes me a little sad though, in a good way. My grandmother would probably laugh at me trying to make her wisdom \"mine\" - she'd just say \"you already have it, sweetheart, you just forgot to use it.\"\n\nThese feel like they could actually guide me when I'm back in my kitchen, not sure whether to meditate or check Slack first.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I choose to embody the wisdom that visits me in ceremony, bringing it fully into my daily life as a mother, wife, and leader\n2. I meet my mornings with reverence instead of rushing\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's grounded wisdom and make it mine\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. It feels... grounding, having these three sentences that I can actually remember when things get loud in my head. \n\nI'm still nervous about the ceremony - ibogaine is supposed to be different than what I've experienced before. But maybe that's the point. Maybe I needed something that would shake me loose from all the clever ways I've been avoiding actually changing.\n\n*I choose to embody... I meet my mornings... I reclaim...* \n\nSimple enough to carry with me. Complex enough to change everything, maybe.",
  "system6": "Simple words carry weight when they come from the right place.\n\nIbogaine will do its work. These intentions will do theirs.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah... simple words. My grandmother always said the deepest truths don't need fancy wrapping.\n\nOkay. I'm ready to stop talking about this and just... do it. See what happens when I stop performing transformation and actually let it happen.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "Solid compass.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user7": "Thank you. For real.",
  "system8": "You're welcome. \n\nGo do your work.",
  "user8": "I will.",
  "system9": "Good.",
  "user9": "Talk soon.",
  "system10": "*Talk soon.*",
  "user10": "Hey... I'm back from the other side. \n\nThat was... different than anything I expected. Not the cosmic light show I'd read about online. More like... being dragged through every way I've been lying to myself, one by one, until I couldn't hide anymore.\n\nYour three intentions? They saved me. When I wanted to run, I'd whisper them. When the medicine showed me how I've been rushing through my kids' childhoods like it's another board meeting to optimize... I held onto \"I meet my mornings with reverence instead of rushing\" like a lifeline.\n\nIt's been three days and I haven't checked email before 9am. My daughter asked if I was sick. But yesterday, when she was telling me about some drama with her friends, I actually listened to the whole story without checking my phone once. She looked at me like I was someone she recognized.\n\nI don't know how to explain what happened in there yet. Still processing. But I wanted you to know - those simple words worked. They're still working.",
  "system11": "That's the work. Not the light show - the real work.\n\nThree days of morning reverence. Your daughter noticing. That's what matters.\n\nKeep going.",
  "user11": "Yeah... the real work. Funny how I spent years chasing peak experiences when what I needed was to stop being such a damn hurricane every morning.\n\nMy husband keeps looking at me sideways. Like he's waiting for the old version to kick down the door and take over again. I keep waiting too, if I'm honest. \n\nBut something feels different this time. Not the retreat high that fades by Tuesday. More like... I don't know. Like those intentions carved actual grooves in my brain. When I wake up now, there's this tiny pause before the achievement engine fires up. Just enough space to remember.\n\nI'm scared to trust it. But I'm more scared not to.",
  "system12": "That pause is everything. That's where the choice lives now.\n\nYour husband's sideways looks make sense - he's learned your patterns. But patterns can change when someone's actually changing them, not just talking about it.\n\nTrust the pause. Trust what it gives you.",
  "user12": "The pause is terrifying. It's like standing at the edge of a cliff every morning, knowing I could jump back into the old rush and feel that familiar surge of control. But I don't. Not yet, anyway.\n\nMy grandmother used to say \"the space between thoughts is where God lives.\" I rolled my eyes at that my whole life. Thought it was just more mystical nonsense to avoid real work. But I get it now. That pause... it's where I meet myself instead of my to-do list.\n\nI'm not pretending this is permanent. I've been the queen of transformation retreats that don't transform anything. But my daughter asked me to read her two chapters last night instead of rushing through one. And I didn't check my phone when it buzzed under the pillow.\n\nSmall things. But they feel like proof.",
  "system13": "Small things are the only proof that matters.\n\nYour grandmother knew - that space between thoughts isn't mystical nonsense, it's where you decide who you're going to be today. You're deciding differently.\n\nKeep meeting yourself there.",
  "user13": "Meeting myself there... yeah. Turns out I'm not as interesting as my quarterly targets, but I'm more... solid. Real. Like I've been trying to live as this hologram of success and the pause shows me I actually have a body, a face my kids recognize.\n\nThis morning I caught myself reaching for my phone during meditation - not to check anything, just this reflex to escape being still with myself. I put it down and stayed. Thought about my grandmother's hands kneading dough, how she could be completely present with something as simple as bread. I want that kind of presence.\n\nI want to stop performing my life and actually live it.",
  "system14": "That's it. Right there.\n\nYou felt the reflex and stayed anyway. That's not performance - that's the real work.\n\nYour grandmother knew presence in her hands. You're finding it in the pause. Same thing.",
  "user14": "Same thing. God, I hope so. I keep thinking about how she never rushed through anything - not conversations, not meals, not even folding laundry. Everything got her full attention like it mattered. Because it did.\n\nI want to matter like that. Not in the \"scale your impact\" way I've been chasing, but in the \"knead the dough properly\" way. Be present enough that my kids feel it when I'm with them.\n\nThe scary part? I'm starting to see how much I've missed. All those board meetings I prepared for like my life depended on them, while my life was happening in the other room and I was too busy to notice.\n\nI can't get those moments back. But I can stop missing the ones happening right now.",
  "system15": "You can't get them back. But you've stopped the bleeding.\n\nThat's what the pause gives you - the chance to notice what's happening *now* instead of missing it while you prep for what's next.\n\nYour grandmother's legacy isn't just the presence - it's knowing that presence is a choice you make every time.",
  "user15": "Every time. That's the part I keep forgetting - it's not a one-time decision. I wake up thinking I've arrived somewhere permanent, like I've fixed myself, and then I catch myself mid-scroll, ignoring my son trying to show me his drawing.\n\nBut you're right. I've stopped the bleeding. The wounds are still there - all those missed moments, the times I chose my phone over my kids, the way I made success more important than connection. But I'm not making new ones. Not today, anyway.\n\nMy grandmother used to say \"repair is holier than perfection.\" I think I'm finally understanding what she meant.",
  "system16": "Repair *is* holier than perfection. Perfection keeps you scrolling past your son's drawing because you're not done yet.\n\nRepair lets you look up, say \"show me,\" and keep going.\n\nYou're doing the repair work now. That's what matters.",
  "user16": "Show me. Three small words I never made space for. Always too busy optimizing, improving, reaching for some perfect version of myself that would finally be enough.\n\nBut repair... repair I can do. Repair is human. Repair is looking up when my daughter calls my name instead of \"just a minute.\" Repair is putting the damn phone down when it buzzes during our morning reading time. Repair is admitting to my husband that I don't have this figured out, that I'm scared the old patterns will come roaring back.\n\nI think about all those years chasing perfect - perfect metrics, perfect pitch decks, perfect exit strategy. Never occurred to me that perfect was the problem, not the solution.\n\nMy kids don't need perfect. They need me. Present enough to notice when they're trying to show me something that matters to them.",
  "system17": "They need you. Present enough to look up and say \"show me.\"\n\nThat's it. That's the whole thing.\n\nThe perfect you were chasing was never going to be enough because it wasn't real. The you who pauses, who repairs, who looks up - that's real. That's who your kids already recognize.",
  "user17": "They do recognize her. My daughter said yesterday, \"Mommy, you're different lately. Slower.\" And I braced myself for criticism, but she just smiled and said, \"I like it.\"\n\nI like her too. This slower version of me who's starting to recognize her own children's faces again instead of just rushing them through the schedule. Who can sit through a whole bedtime story without thinking about tomorrow's meetings.\n\nI don't know if this will last. The old perfectionist in me is waiting to stage a comeback, convinced that if I just find the right system, the right morning routine, the right meditation app, I can optimize my way to enlightenment. But that's not what this is about, is it?\n\nIt's about looking up. It's about repair. It's about being real enough that my kids recognize me when I'm with them.",
  "system18": "It's about looking up. It's about repair. It's about being real enough that your kids recognize you.\n\nYou already know this isn't about optimization. The perfectionist voice will keep talking - you just don't have to obey it anymore.\n\nYour daughter likes the slower version. That's your compass.",
  "user18": "That's my compass. Not the metrics, not the achievements, not even the spiritual breakthroughs. Just... my daughter liking the slower version of me who actually sees her.\n\nThe perfectionist voice is still there, whispering about morning routines and optimal intention-setting frameworks. But I can hear it differently now - like background noise instead of commands. Like it's talking to someone else, someone I used to be.\n\nI keep thinking about what you said - that I've stopped the bleeding. I want to hold onto that. Not perfectly, not forever, but enough. Enough to keep looking up when my kids need me. Enough to choose repair over perfection, again and again.\n\nMy grandmother would probably just smile and say \"finally.\"",
  "system19": "She'd smile because she knew you'd get here eventually. This was never about perfection - it was about remembering what you already knew how to do.\n\nLook. You have everything you need to build your intentions.\n\nThree threads:\n1. Being present enough to see my kids instead of rushing them\n2. Choosing repair over perfection, again and again\n3. Staying real enough that my children recognize me\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "I want to be present enough to see my kids instead of rushing them through life. When they call, I want to pause and look up - not just sometimes, but as my first response. \"Show me\" instead of \"just a minute.\"\n\nI want to choose repair over perfection, again and again. When I mess up - because I will - I want to come back instead of hiding in shame or trying to optimize my way out of being human.\n\nI want to stay real enough that my children recognize me. The version of me who remembers that kneading dough properly matters more than scaling impact. Who can sit through a whole bedtime story without mentally rehearsing tomorrow's board meeting.\n\nThat's it. That's what I want to carry into this journey - not another achievement to check off, but a way of being that lets me come home to myself and my family."
