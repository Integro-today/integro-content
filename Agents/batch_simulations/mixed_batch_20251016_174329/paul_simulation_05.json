  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with the nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up Amanda like this\u2014she says I scare her sometimes when I'm shouting in my sleep. \n\nI guess... I need to figure out how to shut it off. Whatever's been haunting me for twelve years. I did what I had to do over there, and I don't regret it. But I can't lose her.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Make Amanda feel safe again\n3. Find peace with what you had to do\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's about right. \n\nI need to sleep through the night without waking up drenched in sweat, thinking I'm back in the cockpit. Need to stop scaring Amanda when I'm thrashing around. \n\nAnd I guess... I need to make peace with it somehow. What I had to do over there. The losses. Without feeling like I'm betraying the guys who didn't make it back.\n\nHow do we turn this into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I find peace with what I carried home\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I create safety for Amanda and myself.\" That's what matters most. I hate that she walks on eggshells around me now, never knowing when I might snap. \n\nBut the first one\u2014I don't know about \"peacefully.\" Sounds too... soft. Makes it feel like I'm asking for something I don't deserve. Maybe just \"I sleep through the night without terror\"?\n\nAnd the third one feels right, but I still don't know what \"peace\" looks like. How do you make peace with watching your wingman get shot down?",
  "system3": "\"I sleep through the night without terror\" - that's solid.\n\nFor the third, maybe \"I carry their memory with honor instead of horror\"?\n\nSo:\n1. I sleep through the night without terror\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I carry their memory with honor instead of horror\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that third one. \"I carry their memory with honor instead of horror.\" That's it. I need to stop seeing their faces every time I close my eyes. Need to remember them as the warriors they were, not just... the way they ended.\n\nThese all feel right. Straightforward. Nothing flowery about them. Just what I need to do to keep my family together and stop feeling like I'm losing my mind every night.\n\nI can work with these.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without terror\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself  \n3. I carry their memory with honor instead of horror\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Good. I'll keep these close. Maybe write them down, keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for helping me get this straight. Three weeks until Costa Rica. I don't know what to expect from this plant medicine stuff, but at least now I know what I'm aiming for.",
  "system5": "Solid plan. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're already doing their job by pointing you toward what matters.\n\nThree weeks is good time to let these settle in. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "Roger that. I'll let 'em settle. Been twelve years carrying this weight\u2014a few more weeks won't hurt.\n\nAnd hey... thanks for not making this feel like therapy. I appreciate that.",
  "system6": "Understood. You know what you're doing.\n\nSee you on the other side.",

  "user16": "Hey. Look, I... I don't really know how this is supposed to work. Heroic Hearts said I should talk to someone before the thing in Costa Rica. Said it might help me figure out what I'm looking for.\n\nTruth is, I just need to stop waking up Amanda every night. She's... she's at her wit's end. Can't keep putting her through this.",

They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user17": "I don't know how to put this into words. I mean... I've never been good at this kind of thing. \n\nI guess... I need to figure out why I keep seeing those damn dreams every night. The ones where I'm back there and I can't save them. I need them to stop before I lose her completely.\n\nAnd I need to figure out how to be... I don't know, softer? Amanda says I'm like a stranger now. My kids think I'm some hero but they don't see me screaming in my sleep.\n\nI just want to be the man I used to be. Before all this. Is that even possible?",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop the nightmares that wake Amanda and haunt you\n2. Become present and connected with your family again\n3. Reclaim the man you were before all this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "Yeah... that sounds about right. \n\nBut I don't want to lose who I am either. I keep hearing people talk about this stuff like it's going to make me all... I don't know, weak or something. Like I won't be able to protect my family anymore.\n\nI'm still me. I just... I need to be able to sleep through the night. Need to look Amanda in the eye without seeing that fear in hers. Need to feel something other than this constant... pressure. Like I'm always waiting for something bad to happen.\n\nI want to be the man she married. The one who could joke around, who didn't jump at loud noises, who could sit through a whole movie without getting up to check the doors three times.\n\nBut I don't want to lose the parts that matter. The parts that kept me alive over there. Does that make any sense?",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim the man Amanda married without losing what kept me alive\n3. I show up present and unguarded with my family\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The second one's not quite right. It's too... I don't know, soft or something. \"Reclaim the man Amanda married\" - that makes it sound like I need fixing.\n\nHow about something more like... \"I find a way to carry what happened without it crushing everything else.\" Or \"I learn to live with the memories without letting them control me.\"\n\nAnd \"unguarded\" - that's not me. I can't just drop my guard completely. That's not how I stayed alive. Maybe something like... \"I show up as myself, not just the soldier version of me.\"\n\nI don't know. This is harder than I thought it would be."
