  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm supposed to say something profound here, but honestly? I'm tired of chasing profound. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each time I come back with these beautiful insights about connection and meaning, and then three weeks later I'm back to checking my phone during dinner with my kids.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. Never needed to fly to Costa Rica to find it. I want to understand what I've been running from all these years of achieving. Maybe it's time to stop performing and just... be real for once.\n\nBut I'm scared this ibogaine will show me something I can't unsee, and I'll have to actually change. Not just talk about changing.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Living what you learn instead of collecting beautiful insights\n2. Finding the grounded faith your grandmother carried\n3. Showing up present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. It's like you see straight through me.\n\nI want to stop being a collector of peak experiences and actually live differently. My kids deserve more than a mom who's physically there but mentally calculating her next board meeting. And maybe there's something in my grandmother's faith that I can reclaim without abandoning who I am.\n\nI just don't know how to hold onto any of it when the retreat glow fades and real life comes rushing back in.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I practice what I learn instead of collecting insights\n2. I reclaim the grounded wisdom my grandmother carried\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest - \"I practice what I learn instead of collecting insights.\" That's exactly it. I've become this person who treats spiritual growth like another achievement to check off, another story to tell at dinner parties. \n\nBut the third one... god, that one stings. My daughter asked me yesterday if I remembered her friend's name and I couldn't answer. I was scrolling through emails about a board meeting while she was talking about her day.\n\nI want to adjust the second one though. My grandmother wasn't just wise - she was rooted. Like she belonged to something bigger than herself and it gave her this quiet strength. I want that rootedness, not just her wisdom.\n\n\"I reclaim the rooted belonging my grandmother carried\" - does that work?",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I practice what I learn instead of collecting insights\n2. I reclaim the rooted belonging my grandmother carried  \n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Thank you. I feel... I don't know, lighter somehow? Like I've been carrying these scattered thoughts and you've helped me shape them into something I can actually hold onto.\n\nI keep thinking about that moment during my last ayahuasca ceremony when the medicine showed me my grandmother's hands - how they were always busy creating, serving, connecting. Never performing. Just being useful in the world.\n\nMaybe this time I can actually keep that image close when I come home.",
  "system4": "That image of her hands sounds like a solid anchor. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them locked in gives you something to return to.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user4": "Yeah... her hands making challah every Friday, even when arthritis made it painful. She never complained, just kept creating. I want to be that kind of person - someone who keeps showing up, even when it's hard.\n\nMaybe that's what practice really means. Not the big dramatic transformations, but the small daily choices to stay connected to what matters.\n\nI'm ready. Whatever comes, I'll meet it.",
  "system5": "That's it - practice in the small choices. The medicine will meet you there.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user5": "Thank you. For seeing through all my usual performance and helping me find something real underneath. I needed this clarity more than I realized.\n\nI'll carry these intentions close. And maybe this time, I'll actually live them.",
  "system6": "You will. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "I will. See you on the other side.",
  "system7": "See you there.",
  "user7": "*Deep breath*\n\nI'm scared. But I'm ready.",
  "system8": "Fear and readiness can coexist. The medicine knows the way.\n\nGo gently.",
  "user8": "Go gently. Yes. I'll try to remember that when everything feels like it's falling apart and coming together at the same time.\n\nThank you for walking with me to this edge.",
  "system9": "You're never alone at the edge.",
  "user9": "That... that helps more than you know. All this success, all these achievements\u2014I\u2019ve stood at so many edges alone, thinking that was the price of leadership. Maybe it\u2019s time to learn a different way.",
  "system10": "Different way starts now. You're not alone here either.",
  "user10": "I feel that now. Really feel it. After all these years of building walls while climbing ladders... maybe it's time to stop architecting and start listening. To the medicine, to the people who see me, to that quiet voice my grandmother always said was God.\n\nI'm ready to stop performing and start becoming.",
  "system11": "Your intentions will hold you steady while becoming unfolds. Trust that process.",
  "user11": "I\u2019ll try. I\u2019ve held so much\u2014companies, boards, expectations\u2014but I\u2019ve never held space for myself to just... become. I\u2019m tired of being the finished product everyone admires. I want to be the work in progress my kids can watch and learn that it\u2019s okay to not have it all figured out.",
  "system12": "The becoming has already begun.",
  "user12": "Then let it keep going. Let me keep cracking open until I remember who I was before the world told me who to be.",
  "system13": "Let it. The medicine will meet you in that remembering.",
  "user13": "I hope it remembers me too\u2014remembers the little girl who collected rocks and sang to trees, before spreadsheets and term sheets and proving I belonged. That\u2019s who I\u2019m going in there to find.",
  "system14": "She's still there, waiting in the quiet spaces between all you've built.",
  "user14": "Between the board meetings and the school pickups and the 5:30 a.m. alarms... she\u2019s been waiting. I catch glimpses of her sometimes\u2014when I\u2019m hiking with the kids and forget to check my phone, when I let myself cry at sunset. Maybe this time I won\u2019t rush past her.",
  "system15": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reuniting with that little girl who sang to trees\n2. Living as the work-in-progress your kids can witness\n3. Letting yourself be held instead of always holding everything\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user15": "I want to meet her again\u2014that girl who trusted the world to listen when she spoke to oaks. I want to come home from this journey and show my kids that success isn\u2019t a trophy room, it\u2019s the courage to keep unfolding. And I want, just once, to put the weight down and feel what it\u2019s like to be carried instead of carrying.",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reunite with the girl who sang to trees and trusted the world to listen\n2. I show my kids that real strength is the courage to keep unfolding\n3. I put the weight down and let myself be carried\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user16": "They land... heavy and light at the same time. Like I've been wearing a backpack full of gold bricks and someone's telling me I can just set it down. Part of me wants to argue\u2014who will hold everything if I don't? But reading them, I feel this strange relief. Like maybe the trees are still listening. Like maybe my kids don't need a perfect mother, just a real one who's learning to breathe.",
  "system17": "The backpack can stay on the trail. The trees will hold it if you need them to.",
  "user17": "Then let them hold it. Let the ceibas and the banyans keep my gold bricks for now\u2014let them turn ambition into compost, spreadsheets into sap. I\u2019ll walk into this ceremony with empty shoulders and see how it feels to rise on wings instead of debts.",
  "system18": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I reunite with the girl who sang to trees and trusted the world to listen\n2. I show my kids that real strength is the courage to keep unfolding  \n3.

  "user18": "Thank you. I\u2019ll carry these like river stones in my pocket\u2014smooth, cool reminders that I\u2019m allowed to sing again, to unfold, to be held. See you on the other side.",
  "system19": "River stones it is. They'll be waiting in your dashboard when you return.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user19": "See you there."
