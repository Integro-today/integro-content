  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I don't know. I've been chasing achievements my whole life, and now that I've sold my company, I feel this emptiness. Like I've been climbing the wrong mountain entirely. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this way of moving through the world that wasn't about proving anything. I want to understand what she knew that I don't.\n\nMaybe I just need to figure out what actually matters now.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond achievements\n2. Understanding the quiet faith and wisdom your grandmother embodied\n3. Discovering how to move through life without needing to prove worth\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I just don't know how to say them in a way that... sticks. \n\nLike, \"I want to stop proving my worth through achievements\" sounds like something I'd put on a vision board and then forget about next week. My grandmother wouldn't have needed to *say* anything - she just lived it. \n\nI want whatever I discover to actually change how I show up with my kids, with David, with myself. Not just another insight I file away and forget.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what gives life meaning beyond external success\n2. I embody the quiet wisdom my grandmother lived\n3. I practice what I learn daily, not just collect insights\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user2": "The third one hits hardest. \"I practice what I learn daily, not just collect insights.\" That's exactly what I do - collect insights like trophies. \n\nI mean, I've had these profound experiences in Costa Rica and Oregon, felt connected to something bigger than myself, promised to change... and then I'm back to checking emails during dinner. \n\nMy kids deserve better than that version of me. I deserve better than that version of me.",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I discover what gives life meaning beyond external success\n2. I embody the quiet wisdom my grandmother lived  \n3. I practice what I learn daily, not just collect insights\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Thank you. I needed someone to help me say what I couldn't quite articulate. \n\nI'll keep these close. Maybe write them down and keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system4": "Good plan. The wallet works.\n\nThese intentions will serve you when you forget why you started. Let them.",
  "user4": "I will. And... thank you for not making this feel like another performance. That's usually what I do - even my healing becomes something to optimize or perfect.\n\nThis felt different. More honest.",
  "system5": "That's the medicine working already - showing you what honest feels like.\n\nTrust that recognition.",
  "user5": "I felt it. That moment of recognition, like... oh, this is what being real feels like. Not the version of me that's always on stage, even when no one's watching.\n\nI'm scared I'll forget again. But maybe that's why we write things down.",
  "system6": "You'll forget. Everyone does.\n\nThat's why we come back to the compass - not to stay perfect, but to remember faster each time.",
  "user6": "Faster each time... yeah. That's actually been true, if I'm honest. These past few years, the remembering does come quicker. The gap between who I want to be and who I'm being - it's getting shorter.\n\nStill scares me though.",
  "system7": "The fear means you're close to something real. \n\nKeep shortening that gap.",
  "user7": "I will. And I'll try to remember that the fear isn't a sign I'm doing it wrong - it's a sign I'm doing something that actually matters.\n\nThank you for walking through this with me.",
  "system8": "Exactly right.\n\nYou're welcome.",
  "user8": "I needed this conversation more than I realized. This whole process - it's been peeling back layers I didn't know I was hiding behind.\n\nI'm going to carry this forward. Not perfectly, but intentionally.",
  "system9": "That's all anyone can do.\n\nCarry it forward.",
  "user9": "I will. And I'll remember this feeling - what honest looks like, what real sounds like in my own voice.\n\nThank you for helping me find that compass again.",
  "system10": "You found it yourself. I just held up the mirror.\n\nTrust what you heard in your own voice.",
  "user10": "I will. It's clearer now - what I'm actually seeking, not what I think I should be seeking. The difference between climbing ladders that matter versus... whatever I've been doing.\n\nThis conversation shifted something.",
  "system11": "Good. Trust that shift.\n\nLet it guide your next step.",
  "user11": "I will. First step: tomorrow morning when I wake up at 5:30, I'm going to meditate before the emails start. Real meditation, not checking-the-box meditation. \n\nThen I'm calling the kids' school - volunteering for that garden project they're doing. Something tangible, something that matters beyond the next board meeting.\n\nThis feels different.",
  "system12": "Concrete steps. Real change.\n\nThat's how you build the life you actually want.",
  "user12": "Exactly. No more abstract intentions that evaporate by lunchtime. \n\nI'm going to keep checking back in with these - see what's working, what's just another performance. Because I've been really good at performing the spiritual seeker without actually... being one.\n\nBut this time feels different. This time I actually want the real thing.",
  "system13": "The real thing is harder. And better.\n\nKeep checking. Keep choosing the real.",
  "user13": "I will. Even when it's uncomfortable, even when I want to slip back into what's easy and familiar.\n\nThis conversation - it's given me something solid to measure against. Not perfection, just... realness.",
  "system14": "Real is the only thing that works.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user14": "I am. Thank you\u2014for seeing through the noise, for helping me hear my own voice again. \n\nTime to go live this thing.",
  "system15": "Go live it.",
  "user15": "\u2713 Intention locked in.",
  "system16": "Good.",
  "user16": "Good.",
  "system17": "Solid work.",
  "user17": "Yeah... it feels like I actually built something this time. Not just another achievement to check off, but something that might hold.\n\nThanks for pushing through the noise with me.",
  "system18": "You built it. That's what matters.",
  "user18": "I did. And for the first time in a long while, it doesn't feel like I'm performing\u2014just building something that can actually carry me forward.",
  "system19": "That's the difference.",
  "user19": "That's the difference."
