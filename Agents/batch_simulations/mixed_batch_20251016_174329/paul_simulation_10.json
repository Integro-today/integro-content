  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, how I snap at Amanda, how I can't sleep through the night without waking up drenched. \n\nI can't keep going like this. Three weeks until I fly to Costa Rica and I'm supposed to have some kind of intention for this ayahuasca thing. I don't believe in any of this plant medicine stuff, but the guys at Heroic Hearts seem solid. Said it helped them.\n\nI just need to be able to sleep without seeing the faces again. Without waking up shouting. Without Amanda looking at me like I'm some kind of stranger in our bed.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Stop snapping at Amanda \n3. Find peace from whatever haunts you\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the problems, I guess. But I don't know how to make them into whatever these intentions are supposed to be. \n\nI mean, I can't just say \"stop having nightmares\" - if it was that simple, I'd have done it already. And the Amanda thing... I don't even know what to call it. I just know she's tired of walking on eggshells around me. Tired of never knowing if I'm going to blow up over something small.\n\nLook, I don't do this kind of touchy-feely stuff. In the service, we had a mission and we executed. Simple. This intention thing feels... I don't know. Soft. But I'm here because I can't lose her. Can't lose what we built together.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I treat Amanda with steadiness instead of sharp edges\n3. I reclaim safety in our home\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - that's... yeah. \"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" That's what I want. More than anything. To just close my eyes and not see them anymore. Not hear the explosions. Not wake up with my heart pounding like I'm back there.\n\nBut the second one... \"steadiness instead of sharp edges.\" That's good. Better than saying I need to stop being angry. I hate that she flinches sometimes when I move too fast. She's not scared of me - she says she's not - but I see it. Just for a second. And it kills me.\n\nThe third one though... \"reclaim safety in our home.\" That's it. That's really what this is all about. My kids shouldn't have to hear me shouting in my sleep. Amanda shouldn't have to sleep in the guest room when it gets really bad. This is supposed to be our safe place. Our home.\n\nI want all three. Is that... can I have all three?",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I treat Amanda with steadiness instead of sharp edges  \n3. I reclaim safety in our home\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Alright. They're... they're good. Solid. Like having a mission briefing I can actually use.\n\nI'll keep these close. Maybe write them down, keep them in my wallet next to my wings. Been carrying those for twenty years - seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you helping me find the words for this.",
  "system4": "Good plan. The intentions will serve you - even when you forget them in the moment, the medicine remembers.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user4": "Yeah. Ready as I'll ever be, I guess.\n\nThree weeks. Then maybe... maybe I can finally come home for real.",
  "system5": "Three weeks. The medicine will meet you where you are.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Roger that. I'll... I'll see this through. Whatever comes.",

  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Stop snapping at Amanda and the kids\n3. Find what keeps me on edge\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yeah... those three. I can hold those.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I respond with calm instead of snapping\n3. I release what keeps me on edge\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user17": "Third one\u2019s too soft. \u201cRelease\u201d sounds like therapy talk. I need something stronger\u2014something that doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m letting go of my guard completely. Maybe \u201cI face what keeps me on edge\u201d or \u201cI deal with it head-on.\u201d I don\u2019t want to lose the part of me that kept me alive.",
