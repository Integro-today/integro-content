## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_3**: Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts set this up - said it might help with... whatever's going on. I just need to sleep through the night without waking up the whole house. That's it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Heroic Hearts sent you - that tells me you're probably military or veteran. Sleep's wrecking your whole house.

When you wake up at night, what's happening? Nightmares, flashbacks, or just can't stay asleep?


**paul_persona_3**: I didn't say anything about nightmares. Just... bad dreams. Sometimes I wake up and I'm sweating, heart racing. Amanda says I shout sometimes but I don't remember that part. It's not PTSD if that's what you're thinking. I just need to get my head straight so I can function.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Bad dreams, sweating, shouting - your body's fighting something in your sleep. Amanda's catching the worst of it.

What's happening when you're awake? How's the hypervigilance, the scanning for exits, jumping at sounds that aren't there?


**paul_persona_3**: I don't jump at sounds. I just... notice things. Always have. It's called situational awareness - kept me alive over there. Nothing wrong with being alert.

But yeah, I check the locks more than I probably need to. And sometimes when a car backfires or there's a loud noise, I... I guess I get tense. It's just how I'm wired now.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Situational awareness kept you alive - now it's keeping you from rest. Checking locks, getting tense at backfires, that's your body still on patrol.

When you imagine actually resting, what changes? What would Amanda notice first?


**paul_persona_3**: If I could actually rest... I don't know. Maybe I wouldn't snap at the kids when they're just being loud. Amanda says I scare her sometimes when I get angry - I hate that. She'd probably notice I wasn't so damn tense all the time. Maybe I could actually sit through a whole movie without getting up to check something.

I want to be the man my kids think I am. Not the one who wakes up angry and goes to bed exhausted.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Snapping at kids, scaring Amanda, can't sit through a movie - that's not who you want to be. Your kids see someone you're not sure you are anymore.

Three threads here:
1. Finding rest from whatever's hijacking your sleep
2. Teaching your body it's home now, not on patrol
3. Being the man your kids already think you are

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah... yeah, that's about right. I just don't know how to get there from here. This plant stuff - I don't believe in it, but I can't keep doing this to Amanda and the kids. If there's even a chance...

So how do we do this intention thing?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads, here are intentions that might work:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep, releasing whatever fights me in the night
2. I teach my body it's home now, not on patrol
3. I become the steady man my kids already believe I am

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: The first one - about the sleep. That one hits. But "peaceful sleep" sounds too soft. I need something stronger. Something that says I'm done with this crap controlling me at night.

The second one's good too. My body needs to know I'm home, not back there.

The third... I don't know. What if I'm already that man but I just... lost him somewhere?


**intentions_workflow_3**: You want stronger - something that says you're done being controlled at night.

For intention 1, what about "I reclaim my nights from whatever hijacks my sleep"? Or "I take back control of my nights"?

And yeah, maybe intention 3 should be "I reclaim the steady man my kids know I am" - since he's there, just buried.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. "I reclaim my nights from whatever hijacks my sleep." That's better. That's what I want - to take back what's mine.

And "I reclaim the steady man my kids know I am." That's... that's good too. Because he is in there. I see it sometimes when I'm coaching their teams or helping with homework. That guy who doesn't jump at every damn noise.

The middle one's fine too. "I teach my body it's home now, not on patrol." Simple. Direct.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I reclaim my nights from whatever hijacks my sleep"

✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I teach my body it's home now, not on patrol"

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I reclaim the steady man my kids know I am"

Three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:
- Write them on a card in your wallet
- Read them during morning coffee
- Keep them where you see the kids' photos

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**paul_persona_3**: I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years, since basic. Seems right to keep these close too. 

Maybe read 'em during my morning coffee. That's when I'm most clear-headed, before the day starts demanding things from me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I reclaim my nights from whatever hijacks my sleep
- I teach my body it's home now, not on patrol
- I reclaim the steady man my kids know I am

Your ritual: In your wallet with your morning coffee. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

You're set. Trust what emerges.


**paul_persona_3**: Thanks. I... I appreciate this. Heroic Hearts thinks this plant stuff can help. I don't buy it. But I can't lose her. I can't lose them.

I'll try to trust it. Just don't know how to shut it off, you know?


**intentions_workflow_3**: I hear you. You don't have to buy into anything - just show up with your intentions and see what happens. The medicine doesn't need your belief to work.

You know how to shut things down - you've done it before. This time you're shutting down something that served you once but isn't helping anymore. Different mission, same discipline.

Three days. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_3**: Different mission, same discipline. Yeah... I can work with that. 

Three days.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly. Different mission, same discipline.

Three days.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Three days.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three days. You've got what you need.


**paul_persona_3**: Got it. Thanks.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're welcome.


**paul_persona_3**: Hey... thanks for sticking with me through this. I know I ain't easy to work with. Just... thanks.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're doing the work. That's what matters.

See you on the other side.


**paul_persona_3**: Roger that.
