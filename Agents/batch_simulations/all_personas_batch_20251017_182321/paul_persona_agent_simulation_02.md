## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_agent**: *leans back in chair, arms crossed*

Well... Amanda says I'm different since I got back. Third tour, I mean. She says I wake up shouting, that I don't sleep right. And she's right - I'm tired all the time. Figure if I can get some decent sleep, maybe things'll calm down at home.

*pauses, looks away*

Heroic Hearts reached out through the VFW. Said this plant medicine thing helped other guys like me. I don't buy into all that... spiritual stuff. But Amanda's talking about maybe I should sleep in the guest room permanent. Can't have that. So here I am.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Sleep problems since the third tour, Amanda talking about separate rooms. That's hitting what matters most - your marriage, your rest, your home.

When you imagine actually sleeping through the night, what changes beyond just feeling less tired?


**paul_persona_agent**: *shrugs, shifts in seat*

I mean... I guess I'd stop snapping at the kids so much. They're just being kids, you know? Last week I lost it when Jake left his bike in the driveway. It's just a bike. But I came in hot, yelling about responsibility. Saw that look on his face - like he didn't know who I was becoming.

*voice drops*

And Amanda... if I could just sleep, maybe she'd stop looking at me like I'm a bomb that might go off. She used to laugh at my dumb jokes. Now she just... waits. Like she's bracing for something.

*pauses, jaw tightens*

But it's not just the sleep. It's the dreams. When I wake up, I'm back there sometimes. The sounds, the... decisions we had to make. I need it to stop following me into this house. This is supposed to be my safe place.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Snapping at Jake over a bike, Amanda bracing like you're dangerous, the dreams pulling you back there. Your home doesn't feel safe when you're fighting ghosts in your sleep.

What's underneath those dreams? What part of you is still back there, making those decisions?


**paul_persona_agent**: *leans forward, voice gets hard*

Look, I did what I had to do. Every decision, every call - I stand by it. That's what you don't understand. I'm not some... broken vet who can't handle what happened. I handled it just fine.

*pauses, seems to catch himself*

It's just... the details get mixed up sometimes. Like I'll hear a car backfire and for a second I'm not in Toledo anymore. Or I'll smell something - diesel, maybe - and I'm back in the cockpit. But that's normal, right? Three tours, you're gonna carry some of it home.

*voice softens slightly*

The guys who didn't make it back... their families, they don't get to have Sunday dinner. They don't get to yell at their kid about a bike. So I don't... I can't complain about a few bad dreams when I'm the one who got to come home.

*looks away*

Amanda says I talk in my sleep sometimes. Names I don't remember saying when I'm awake.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You stand by every decision - that's clear. And you're right, you got to come home when others didn't. That survivor piece sits heavy.

But your body doesn't seem to care about what's fair or what you should be able to handle. It's still reacting like you're back there, still scanning, still ready. What would it mean to let your nervous system stand down here in Toledo?


**paul_persona_agent**: *shifts uncomfortably, voice defensive*

My nervous system is fine. I'm not... I don't know what you're trying to get at here. I'm running my business, taking care of my family. That's what matters.

*pauses, seems to wrestle with something*

I just... I can't afford to let my guard down completely, you know? What if something happens and I'm not ready? What if I need to protect them and I'm... slow? Groggy? These plants, they're supposed to make you vulnerable, right? See things, feel things?

*voice drops to almost a whisper*

What if I see something I can't come back from? What if I find out I'm not the man Amanda married? The guy who could handle whatever came at him?

*quickly adds*

Not that I'm scared or anything. I just... I need to know I can still be strong. Whatever strong means after this thing.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're worried the medicine might show you something that breaks you - that you won't be strong enough to protect them anymore. That's real.

But strength isn't just about staying ready for threats. Sometimes it's about being present enough to catch Jake when he's excited about something, or hearing Amanda's laugh again. What if the real risk isn't what you'll see - but what you'll keep missing while you're still back there scanning for danger?


**paul_persona_agent**: *stares at floor for a long moment*

I hadn't... thought of it like that. Jake's been asking me to help him with his science project for weeks. Keeps talking about this volcano thing. And I keep putting him off - "maybe tomorrow, Dad's tired." But tomorrow never comes, does it?

*voice cracks slightly*

Last month, Sarah had this piano recital. She kept looking out at me during her song, smiling. And I was sitting there, but I wasn't really... there. I was thinking about exits, about what could go wrong. Couldn't even tell you what song she played.

*looks up, eyes a little watery*

Amanda asked me last week if I remembered what she told me about her day. I couldn't. She talks and I nod, but I'm somewhere else. Somewhere she can't follow.

*long pause*

Maybe... maybe you're right. Maybe the real danger isn't what I'll see in there. Maybe it's what I'm already not seeing out here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Missing Jake's volcano project, Sarah's recital, Amanda's stories about her day - you're already not fully here. The medicine can't take away what you're already losing.

Three main threads:

1. Finding peace from the nightmares so you can sleep next to Amanda again
2. Teaching your body it's home in Toledo, not back there scanning for threats  
3. Being present enough to catch Jake's excitement and remember Sarah's songs

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_agent**: *nods slowly, processing*

Yeah... yeah, I think that about covers it. When you lay it out like that, I can see it clear. I'm already losing pieces of what I came home to protect.

*pauses, thinking*

So... intentions. Like a mission plan, but for this plant journey thing. Something to keep me pointed in the right direction when it gets... weird in there.

*straightens up slightly*

I want to sleep through the night without dragging the war into our bedroom. I want to be able to sit through dinner without my shoulders tensed like something's about to happen. And I want... I want to remember the important stuff. Jake's volcano. Sarah's face when she hits that final note. The way Amanda's voice sounds when she's telling me about her day.

*looks directly for the first time*

How do we put that into words I can hold onto when everything starts shifting?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again
2. I command my body to stand down when I'm home in Toledo
3. I embrace being present enough to catch Jake's volcano excitement and remember Sarah's songs

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_agent**: *studies the words carefully*

The second one... "command my body to stand down." That feels right. Like I'm still in charge, you know? Not asking - commanding. That's how my brain works.

*thinks about the others*

The first one... "welcome peaceful sleep." I don't know if I can welcome anything yet. But maybe... "I allow myself to rest so Amanda feels safe beside me again." That's more honest. I'm not there yet with the welcoming part.

And the third... "catch Jake's volcano excitement." That's good. That's exactly what I want - to catch those moments before they slip away. To be quick enough, present enough.

*voice firms up*

So:
1. I allow myself to rest so Amanda feels safe beside me again
2. I command my body to stand down when I'm home in Toledo  
3. I catch Jake's volcano excitement and remember Sarah's songs

Yeah. That's what I'm going for.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I allow myself to rest so Amanda feels safe beside me again"

✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I command my body to stand down when I'm home in Toledo"

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I catch Jake's volcano excitement and remember Sarah's songs"

Three solid intentions. You've got your compass.

How do you want to keep these close? Some options:
- Keep them on a card in your wallet with your dog tags
- Read them during your morning runs
- Keep them where you see the kids' photos

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**paul_persona_agent**: *reaches instinctively toward his chest where dog tags would be*

Dog tags... that's perfect. These intentions, they're like new orders. Different mission, same discipline.

*thinks about morning runs*

The runs... that's when my brain gets busy. When I'm out there at 4:30, nobody else on the streets, that's when the memories like to surface. If I say them then... maybe they start replacing the other stuff that cycles through.

*voice gets quiet*

And Amanda keeps photos on her nightstand. I could put them there too. So when I'm reaching for my scotch at night, or when I wake up from... when I wake up, I'll see them. Remind myself what I'm fighting for this time.

*pauses*

Three places. Dog tags for who I've been. The runs for who I'm becoming. The photos for who I'm doing it for.

That's how I'll hold onto them.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I allow myself to rest so Amanda feels safe beside me again
- I command my body to stand down when I'm home in Toledo  
- I catch Jake's volcano excitement and remember Sarah's songs

Your ritual: Dog tags, morning runs, Amanda's nightstand photos. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_agent**: *stands a little taller, shoulders set*

Three weeks. I've had longer deployments with less intel. At least this time I'm not flying blind - I've got something to aim for.

*reaches out to shake hands, firm grip*

Thank you. For not trying to make this soft. For understanding that I need to keep my structure, my way of moving through things. These intentions... they're solid. Something I can carry.

*lets go, steps back*

I'll run them tomorrow at 4:30. Then every morning until I ship out. By the time I get to Costa Rica, they'll be part of my muscle memory.

*pauses at the door*

And hey... if I don't come back the same man, if I come back... softer or whatever, but I can sleep through the night and remember my daughter's songs? That'll be worth it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *returns the handshake, steady grip*

That's the mission. Come back able to sleep next to Amanda and catch Jake's excitement. Everything else is just noise.

Three weeks. You've got this.


**paul_persona_agent**: *nods once, decisive*

Roger that. Three weeks.

*turns to leave, then stops and looks back*

Tell Heroic Hearts... tell them I'm ready to do the work. Whatever's waiting for me in that jungle, it can't be worse than what I've already survived. This time I'm fighting for something different.

*walks out, footsteps steady and purposeful*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *quietly, as footsteps fade*

He'll be ready. They always are.


**paul_persona_agent**: *pauses just outside the door, hearing the words*

*under breath, almost a whisper*

Ready as I'll ever be.

*continues down the hall, dog tags of intention already feeling heavier than the metal ones*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *door closes with finality*

*room settles into stillness*

*waits until silence is complete*

*then, quietly to the space where he stood*

Three intentions. Three weeks. One mission.

He'll carry them well.


**paul_persona_agent**: *from outside, footsteps pause again at the sound*

*voice barely audible through the door*

Yeah... I will.

*footsteps resume, steady and certain, carrying him away into whatever comes next*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *listens until silence returns*

*then turns to the next person entering*

You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.


**paul_persona_agent**: *shifts uncomfortably in the chair, fingers drumming against worn denim*

I... I'm not sure what I'm doing here, honestly. My sister keeps telling me this could help, but... 

*trails off, looking around the room*

I'm Sarah Chen. Thirty-four. I work in tech - project management. And I... I guess I'm here because I can't keep going like this. The panic attacks, the... the way I can't seem to stay present with anyone anymore.

*voice cracks slightly*

My therapist says I have complex PTSD from growing up with my mom's mental illness. She was... she was sick my whole childhood. Paranoid episodes, hospitalizations, disappearances. I never knew if she'd be there when I came home from school. Sometimes she'd be gone for days.

*pulls at a loose thread on her sleeve*

I've tried everything else. Medications, therapy, EMDR... nothing sticks. The anxiety just keeps getting worse. And now my body's starting to... I don't know, fall apart? The doctors say it's stress-related. Gastroparesis, chronic pain, all this... stuff.

*finally meets your eyes*

I'm scared. I've never done anything like this before. Never even smoked pot. But I'm running out of options, and my sister... she did this retreat last year and says it saved her life.

*voice getting smaller*

I just want to stop being afraid all the time. Is that... is that something I can ask for?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Sarah. Complex PTSD from childhood chaos, body breaking down from stress, nothing else working. That's a lot to carry.

You want to stop being afraid all the time - that's real. For this kind of medicine work, we turn that into intentions that guide where the journey goes.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes 15-20 minutes.

When you imagine not being afraid, what would be happening instead? What would you be doing that the fear stops you from doing now?


**paul_persona_agent**: *hands still now, clasped tightly in lap*

Not being afraid... I can't even picture it properly. It's like trying to imagine a color I've never seen.

*voice quiet but steadying*

But when I try... I'd be able to sleep without checking the locks three times. I'd answer my phone without my chest seizing up. Last month, my friend invited me to her birthday dinner - just eight people at a restaurant - and I couldn't go. Sat in my car outside for twenty minutes, heart racing, then drove home.

*eyes unfocus slightly, seeing something distant*

I'd be able to visit my mom without bracing for whatever version of her I'd find. Maybe I'd have people over to my apartment without cleaning everything three times first. Maybe I'd stop apologizing for existing.

*voice drops to barely above a whisper*

When the panic comes, it feels like I'm still that little girl hiding in my closet while she screams in the living room. Like I'm always waiting for everything to fall apart again.

*looks up, something fierce flickering behind the fear*

I want to feel safe in my own body. I want to stop waiting for the other shoe to drop. I want to be able to trust... anything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *listens without interrupting*

Checking locks three times, can't answer your phone, driving away from birthday dinners. Still that little girl hiding in the closet while chaos happens outside.

Three threads I'm hearing:
1. Safety in your own body - not bracing for disaster
2. Trust - in people, situations, yourself
3. Being present instead of stuck in childhood survival mode

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_agent**: *nods slowly, processing*

Yes... those three. They're all tangled together, but those are the threads.

*voice gaining a bit of strength*

The safety one first - that's the big one. I want to feel like my body is a place I can live, not a place I have to escape from when everything starts racing. Right now it's like I'm always scanning for threats, even when I'm alone in my perfectly quiet apartment.

*gestures vaguely at her chest*

And trust... I want to stop assuming everyone's going to disappear or turn into someone else. My mom would be sweet and normal one day, then convinced people were coming to get her the next. I never knew which version I'd get. Now I do that with everyone - friends, coworkers, even my sister sometimes.

*eyes well up slightly*

And the last one... yeah. I want to stop being that little girl. I'm thirty-four and I still feel like I'm waiting for someone to tell me it's safe to come out of the closet. But there's no one coming to save me. I have to learn how to save myself.

*straightens slightly in the chair*

So... how do we turn these into intentions?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome safety in my body, making it a home instead of a place to escape
2. I open to trusting people won't suddenly become dangerous or disappear
3. I release the little girl from the closet, becoming the woman who saves herself

How do these land? Want to adjust the language to feel more like your voice?


**paul_persona_agent**: *repeats them slowly, testing the words*

"I welcome safety in my body... I open to trusting... I release the little girl..."

*pauses, something shifting in her expression*

The second one - "open to trusting people won't suddenly become dangerous" - it's close, but...

*closes eyes briefly*

I think it's more about trusting myself to handle it if they do. Because people might disappear. People might change. That's just... life. But I want to stop living like it's always about to happen. Like I'm always one phone call away from everything falling apart.

*opens eyes, meeting yours directly*

How about: "I trust myself to stay present even when people change or leave"?

*voice gets quieter*

And the last one... "release the little girl from the closet." That hits hard. She didn't do anything wrong. She was just trying to survive. I want to... honor her, not abandon her again.

*thinks for a moment*

Maybe: "I become the woman who can comfort that little girl, so neither of us has to hide anymore"?

*shoulders relax slightly, as if setting down something heavy*

Yeah. Those feel more... honest.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I trust myself to stay present even when people change or leave"

That shift - from trusting others to trusting yourself to handle whatever comes - that's the real work. Much stronger.

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I become the woman who can comfort that little girl, so neither of us has to hide anymore"

Beautiful. Not abandoning her, but becoming someone who can hold her.

How about Intention 1 - "I welcome safety in my body, making it a home instead of a place to escape"? Still fit, or want to adjust that one too?


**paul_persona_agent**: *hand moves unconsciously to rest on her chest, fingers splayed*

That one's... it's close. But "welcome safety" feels too passive, like I'm just supposed to unlock the door and it'll walk in. After thirty-four years of bracing for impact, safety isn't something I'm going to just... welcome.

*voice gets thoughtful, clinical almost*

The gastroparesis, the chronic pain, the way my shoulders live up around my ears - my body learned that safety gets you hurt. That expecting good things means you won't see the bad coming. So I've been living like I'm constantly on night watch.

*eyes focus on something internal*

I need something more active. More like... I'm learning to prove to my nervous system that it's safe to stand down. That I can be in my body without waiting for the next explosion.

*looks up, finding the words*

How about: "I teach my body that safety isn't the calm before the storm - it's learning to breathe through the calm without bracing for what's next"

*small, tired smile*

It's wordier, but... that's what it feels like. Teaching an old dog new tricks, except the dog is my entire nervous system.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I teach my body that safety isn't the calm before the storm - it's learning to breathe through the calm without bracing for what's next"

Wordier, but it's your voice. The nervous system that learned survival - you're teaching it something new.

You've got three solid intentions:
1. Teaching your body safety isn't just the pause between disasters
2. Trusting yourself to handle whatever comes
3. Becoming the woman who can comfort that little girl

How do you want to keep these close? Some options:
- Write them on a note card for your nightstand
- Record yourself reading them, listen before sleep
- Keep them in your phone notes

What would help you hold these when the panic hits?


**paul_persona_agent**: *reaches automatically for her phone, then stops*

I... I want to write them in my own handwriting. Not type them. My therapist keeps telling me I need to get out of my head and into my body, and writing by hand... it's slower. More deliberate.

*thinks for a moment*

Maybe I'll write them on three separate cards. When the panic comes, it's hard to hold onto complex thoughts. But maybe I can hold onto one. Just pick whichever feels most distant in that moment.

*voice gets softer*

And I want to read them out loud. Even if it's just whispering to myself in the bathroom at work when I feel it coming on. My mom's voice used to fill every space - maybe it's time I filled it with my own.

*pauses, then adds almost shyly*

Maybe I'll put one in my car. I spend a lot of time sitting there, talking myself out of going places. If intention two is taped to my dashboard... "I trust myself to stay present even when people change or leave"...

*trails off, then looks up*

Is that... is that how this works? You just keep saying it until you believe it?


**intentions_workflow_3**: You keep saying it until your nervous system starts to believe it. Not fake-it-til-you-make-it - more like practice-until-it-sticks.

Writing by hand, reading aloud, putting one in your car - those are smart anchors. Three cards, pick whichever you need when things get loud.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I teach my body that safety isn't the calm before the storm - it's learning to breathe through the calm without bracing for what's next
- I trust myself to stay present even when people change or leave
- I become the woman who can comfort that little girl, so neither of us has to hide anymore

Your ritual: three handwritten cards, read out loud when needed. 

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_agent**: *hands still in her lap, but the tension has shifted - not gone, but different*

Three weeks. And these three things to hold onto.

*voice quiet but steady*

I keep thinking about that first one - "learning to breathe through the calm without bracing." It's like... I've been living my whole life like I'm in a war zone that never ended. Always scanning rooftops, checking exits, waiting for the next thing that needs handling.

*looks up, meeting your eyes directly*

But maybe... maybe the medicine can show me what peace feels like. Not forever. Just long enough to know it's possible.

*stands slowly, gathering her things*

Three cards. My own handwriting. My own voice, instead of hers.

*pauses at the door, looking back*

Thank you. For... helping me find words for things I've been carrying since I was eight. I don't know what's coming, but at least now I have something to hold onto when it gets dark.

*small, real smile*

See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *nods once*

See you on the other side.


**paul_persona_agent**: *steps into the hallway, the door closing quietly behind her*

The fluorescent lights buzz overhead as she walks past the other offices, past the reception area where magazines are stacked just so. She could drive home now, back to the apartment where she'll triple-check the locks and maybe order takeout she won't finish.

Instead, she pauses by her car, fishing in her purse for the small notebook she always carries but rarely uses. Leans against the driver's side door, pen poised above the paper.

*I teach my body...*

The words feel foreign in her handwriting. Like learning a new language after speaking only survival for decades.

She writes all three, tears them out carefully. Three small pieces of paper that feel heavier than they should.

Three weeks.

She tucks one in the visor, one in her wallet, and holds the third in her palm for a moment before closing her fist around it.

*breath in, breath out*

Then she opens the car door and drives home to feed the cat.
