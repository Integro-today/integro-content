  "system0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and I keep wondering if I'm chasing another retreat high or actually ready to find what sticks. I've built and sold companies, but I can't seem to build a spiritual life that doesn't fade when I get home. My grandmother would say I'm lost, and maybe she's right.",
  "user0": "I hear that tension between your entrepreneurial success and this deeper hunger for something that lasts beyond the retreat bubble - that question of whether you're seeking another peak experience or real transformation.\n\nAn intention acts like a compass for your ibogaine journey - it points toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. Unlike the business goals you might be used to, intentions create space for the medicine to show you what you actually need, not just what you think you want.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your Beond journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what \"sticks\" means to you specifically, and we'll build intentions around creating lasting spiritual connection.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about intention-setting with ibogaine and examples from others who've sought similar lasting change.\n\nWhich feels right to start with?",
  "system1": "I think... option A. The guided questions. I keep setting these intentions - \"be present,\" \"find purpose,\" \"connect with spirit\" - but they feel like I'm checking boxes, like I'm writing OKRs for my soul. I want to understand what actually sticks means. Because right now I can meditate for twenty minutes and feel connected, then get an email about a board meeting and I'm right back in that anxious achiever mode.",
  "user1": "That pattern you describe - meditating and feeling connected, then one email pulling you right back into achiever mode - it's like you're living in two different worlds that don't know how to talk to each other.\n\nLet me ask: when you imagine something that \"actually sticks,\" what would that look like in your daily life? Not the big spiritual moments, but when you're walking to your car or making coffee - what would be different?",
  "system2": "I guess... I wouldn't feel like I'm performing being present? Like right now, even when I'm meditating, there's this part of me that's thinking \"good, you're doing the spiritual practice, check that box.\" But when I'm hiking with my kids and we spot a deer or something... that's the only time I feel like I'm not watching myself live. I'm just *there*. \n\nI want to stop needing the perfect conditions - nature, quiet, no emails - to feel connected. My grandmother used to say blessings over everything - washing hands, lighting candles, even before business meetings. She made the mundane sacred somehow. I want that... to not feel like I'm switching between \"spiritual Ellen\" and \"business Ellen.\"",
  "user2": "That image of your grandmother blessing everything - washing hands, lighting candles, even before business meetings - there's something so natural about how she wove the sacred into ordinary moments. She didn't seem to need perfect conditions either.\n\nWhat do you think she understood about staying connected that you might have forgotten? Or maybe never learned from her?",
  "system3": "I think... she knew that connection wasn't something you achieve, it was something you *return to*. Like breathing - you don't succeed at breathing, you just keep coming back to it when you notice you've been holding your breath.\n\nBut I never learned the *how* from her. She died when I was twelve, right when I was getting good at piano competitions and math contests. My parents celebrated those wins, not the blessings. I think she tried to teach me - she'd take me to temple sometimes, told me stories about the divine spark in everything - but I was already learning that achievement got more applause than awe.\n\nMaybe what I forgot is that there's nothing to achieve. Just... remembering. Over and over.",
  "user3": "\"Nothing to achieve, just remembering over and over\" - that's it, isn't it? Your grandmother knew connection was like breathing, not like building a company. You don't set quarterly goals for remembering to breathe.\n\nBut here's what I'm hearing: you're tired of the performance, of watching yourself try to be spiritual. You want what your grandmother had - that natural returning to connection, even in board meetings, even with emails flooding in.\n\nWhat would it mean to stop trying to build a spiritual life and instead discover how to *remember* the sacred in the middle of your actual life - the meetings, the emails, the chaos?",
  "system4": "It would mean... I stop waiting for the next retreat to fix me. Stop thinking I need to earn connection through perfect meditation streaks or buying the right meditation cushion or finding the perfect spiritual community.\n\nMaybe it means I stop trying to *build* anything for once. Just let the remembering be messy and imperfect. Like... what if I just paused for three seconds before opening my laptop and touched the wood of my desk like it was sacred? What if I looked at my kids' chaos and saw it as prayer instead of interruption?\n\nGod, I sound like a self-help book. But... yeah. I want to stop performing being spiritual and just *be* spiritual. Whatever that means.",
  "user4": "You caught yourself sounding like a self-help book - that awareness is exactly it. The performance is so tempting, even in how we talk about *not* performing.\n\nBut those small pauses you mentioned - touching your desk like it's sacred, seeing the kids' chaos as prayer - that's your grandmother's wisdom showing up. She'd probably laugh and say \"finally, you're getting it.\"\n\nLet me ask: what's the fear underneath stopping the performance? If you stopped trying to build spiritual achievements like you build companies, what are you afraid you might discover - or lose?",
  "system5": "That I'm... nothing special? Just another middle-aged woman trying to figure out her life? All these years of being the one with the answers, the one who built something impressive - if I stop performing, even spiritually, then what am I?\n\nMaybe deeper than that... what if I stop and there's actually nothing there? Just this empty space where I thought \"real Ellen\" lived? My kids see me as the mom who gets things done. My boards see me as the smart advisor. My retreat friends see me as the successful woman having these profound experiences. \n\nWhat if I'm just... afraid there's no *there* there?",
  "user5": "\"Afraid there's no *there* there\" - that's the raw truth, isn't it? All these identities you've built - the successful entrepreneur, the spiritual seeker, the smart advisor, the mom who gets things done - what if underneath it all, there's just... space?\n\nBut here's what your grandmother seemed to know: that empty space isn't nothing. It's where connection actually lives. It's where you don't have to be special to be sacred.\n\nWhat if this ibogaine journey isn't about finding your \"true self\" but about meeting that empty space - and discovering it's not terrifying nothingness but the place where you can finally stop performing?\n\nHow does that land with you?",
  "system6": "It lands... hard. Like a punch to the chest that makes you exhale everything you've been holding.\n\nBecause I've been running from that space my whole life. Achievement after achievement, experience after experience, thinking if I just *did* enough, *became* enough, I'd finally feel... real? Present? Whatever word I'm searching for.\n\nBut what if the running *is* what's been making me feel unreal? What if that empty space is where my grandmother's blessings lived - not in the words she said, but in the space between them?\n\nI think... I think that's what I want from this journey. To stop running long enough to meet that space and discover it's not the enemy I've been treating it as.",
  "user6": "That exhale - \"everything you've been holding\" - that's the moment right there. When you realize the running itself has been what's making you feel unreal.\n\nYour grandmother's blessings lived in the spaces between words... that's beautiful. She knew how to rest in that emptiness without needing to fill it with achievements or spiritual practices to check off.\n\nLet me see if I can capture what I'm hearing:\n\nI'm feeling three threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. **Meeting the empty space** - stopping long enough to discover that what you've been running from isn't terrifying nothingness, but the place where you can finally stop performing\n\n2. **Remembering instead of achieving** - like your grandmother, learning to return to connection as naturally as breathing, not something to earn or build\n\n3. **Letting the sacred be ordinary** - finding how to touch your desk like it's sacred, to see your kids' chaos as prayer, without turning it into another spiritual performance\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system7": "Yes... that's it. You've somehow taken all my rambling and found the thread that runs through it.\n\nI want to stop running. I want to remember what my grandmother knew without making it another achievement. And I want to stop turning everything into a performance, even my spiritual life.\n\nHow do I... how do I turn those into intentions? It feels like if I try too hard to craft them perfectly, I'm already back in achiever mode.",
  "user7": "Exactly - the moment we try to \"perfectly craft\" intentions, we're back in achiever mode. So let's keep this simple and messy, like your grandmother would.\n\nBased on those three threads, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. **\"I open myself to meeting the empty space I've been running from, discovering it's not my enemy.\"**\n\n2. **\"I remember what my grandmother knew - that connection is something I return to, not achieve.\"**\n\n3. **\"I welcome the sacred in ordinary moments without turning it into a performance.\"**\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly? Or would you like to craft something different - maybe using your own words or your grandmother's language?",
  "system8": "I keep reading them over, and the first one... it makes my chest tight in that same way. Like it's already happening just by saying it.\n\nBut I want to add something. My grandmother used to say \"Baruch atah adonai\" - blessed are you. Not \"I bless you,\" but \"blessed *are* you.\" Like the blessing was already there, waiting to be noticed.\n\nSo maybe: \"I open myself to meeting the empty space I've been running from, discovering the blessing that's already there waiting to be noticed.\"\n\nIs that... does that work? Or am I already overthinking it?",
  "user8": "*That works.* \n\nYou can feel it in your chest - that's how you know it's real, not performative. And \"discovering the blessing that's already there waiting to be noticed\" - that's pure grandmother wisdom. She knew blessings aren't created, they're revealed.\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: **\"I open myself to meeting the empty space I've been running from, discovering the blessing that's already there waiting to be noticed.\"**\n\nHow does intention 2 feel? \"I remember what my grandmother knew - that connection is something I return to, not achieve.\" Does that capture what you want, or does it need her voice in it too?",
  "system9": "It feels... almost right, but maybe too... I don't know, clinical? Like I'm describing it instead of feeling it?\n\nMy grandmother would just *be* connected. She'd hum while cooking, touch my face when I was upset, sit in her garden like she belonged there. She didn't *return* to connection - she never left it.\n\nMaybe... \"I remember what my grandmother knew - that I never left connection, I just forgot to notice I was already there.\"\n\nDoes that make sense? Or am I making this too complicated again?",
  "user9": "That's it - that's the difference! She never left it, just lived it. Your version has that lived-in feeling, like worn-soft fabric.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: **\"I remember what my grandmother knew - that I never left connection, I just forgot to notice I was already there.\"**\n\nAnd intention 3 - \"I welcome the sacred in ordinary moments without turning it into a performance\" - how's that sitting with you? Does it need your grandmother's touch too, or does the performance piece capture what you're after?",
  "system10": "The performance piece... yeah, that's important. But \"welcome the sacred in ordinary moments\" - it sounds like I'm still trying to *do* something, you know?\n\nMy grandmother just *saw* it. She didn't welcome it like a guest - it was just there, like air. The way she'd smooth the tablecloth like it mattered, or how she'd look at birds like they were telling her something.\n\nMaybe... \"I see the sacred in ordinary moments without needing to announce it or turn it into something impressive.\"\n\nBecause that's what I do - I announce things, make them *mean* something important. She just... lived it.",
  "user10": "Yes - she just *saw* it, like breathing. Not announcing, not making it impressive. Just smoothing tablecloths and listening to birds like they were neighbors.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: **\"I see the sacred in ordinary moments without needing to announce it or turn it into something impressive.\"**\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now, Ellen. Not achievements to check off, but more like... postures to hold when the ibogaine shows you what it wants to show you.\n\nHow do you want to keep these close during your journey?",
  "system11": "I... I don't know. Writing them down feels like I'm already making them into something to achieve, something to get \"right.\"\n\nMaybe I'll just carry them in my pocket? Like, literally fold them up and keep them with me. I've got this wallet - my grandmother gave me my grandfather's old leather wallet when he died. It's worn soft from years in his pocket, and now mine. It feels like... like continuity, I guess.\n\nI could write them on a small piece of paper and tuck it in there. Not to look at every five minutes, but just... there. Like she's there. Like connection is there, whether I remember to notice it or not.",
  "user11": "*That's perfect.* \n\nThe worn-soft wallet that's lived in two pockets already - it knows how to hold things without making them perform. Just tucked away, like continuity itself.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I open myself to meeting the empty space I've been running from, discovering the blessing that's already there waiting to be noticed.\"\n\n2. \"I remember what my grandmother knew - that I never left connection, I just forgot to notice I was already there.\"\n\n3. \"I see the sacred in ordinary moments without needing to announce it or turn it into something impressive.\"\n\nYour chosen ritual: Tucked in your grandfather's wallet, carried like continuity.\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The ibogaine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you the courage to stop running and the grace to notice what's already there.",
  "system12": "Thank you. For... for helping me find the words that feel like mine, not like something I'm supposed to say. For seeing the difference between my grandmother's knowing and my trying.\n\nI feel... I don't know how I feel. Not ready, exactly, but like I'm standing at the edge of something real. Maybe that's enough.\n\nI'll fold them up tonight, put them in his wallet. Keep them close.",
  "user12": "Standing at the edge of something real - that's exactly where you need to be. Not ready, not perfect, just real.\n\nThe wallet's already holding stories older than you, stories that didn't need announcing. Your intentions will fit right in there.\n\nTake care of yourself in these next days, Ellen. The edge is a good place to stand.",
  "system13": "I will. And... thank you for not trying to make this bigger than it is. For understanding that sometimes the most important things are the ones we carry quietly, without announcement.\n\nMaybe I'll see you on the other side of this.",
  "user13": "Maybe you will. Or maybe you'll just carry this quietly, like your grandmother would - no need to report back or make it into something impressive.\n\nEither way, the wallet will be in your pocket, and the intentions will be doing their quiet work. That's enough.\n\nSafe travels, Ellen.",
  "system14": "That's enough. Yeah. It really is.\n\n*Goodbye.*",
