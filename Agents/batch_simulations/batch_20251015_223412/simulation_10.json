  "system0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for Ibogaine, and I need this to be different from my other journeys. I've built companies, sold them, done all the \"right\" things\u2014but I'm still searching for something I can't name. Maybe you can help me figure out what I'm actually looking for this time.",
  "user0": "I hear you - there's something poignant about achieving all the external markers of success yet still feeling that restless searching. The fact that you're choosing ibogaine, which often brings deep confrontation with ourselves, suggests you're ready to look beyond what you've already accomplished.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. With ibogaine especially, intentions can help guide the often intense introspective work it brings, which tends to show us uncomfortable truths we need to see.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're really hoping to discover beneath all that success. Together we'll build intentions that go deeper than what you've already achieved.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with ibogaine and examples from others who've sought similar answers.\n\nWhich feels right to start with?",
  "system1": "Option A. I keep questioning what all that effort was for if it doesn't mean anything now. I've checked all the boxes, but something's still missing. Like I've been following the wrong map entirely.",
  "user1": "That feeling of following the wrong map entirely - like you've been climbing a mountain only to realize it's not the one you actually needed to climb. That disorientation can be painful, especially when you've proven you can succeed at whatever you set your mind to.\n\nWhat do you think you're hoping to find that all this external success hasn't given you? When you imagine feeling truly fulfilled, what does that look like for you?",
  "system2": "I don't know how to describe it exactly. When I'm out hiking with my kids, just... being there, not checking my phone every five minutes\u2014that's when I feel most like myself. But that feeling never lasts. It's like I catch glimpses of who I could be, but then I'm back in meetings talking about quarterly projections and I feel hollow again.\n\nMy grandmother had this quiet faith, this way of being in the world that was about more than accomplishments. She'd sit with me for hours, just... present. I think I've lost whatever that was. Whatever she knew that I never learned.",
  "user2": "There's something powerful in that image - catching glimpses of your real self during those quiet moments with your kids, only to lose it again in the noise of quarterly projections. Like you're living two different lives entirely.\n\nYour grandmother's quiet presence - that way of being rather than doing - sounds like it touched something essential in you. What do you think she understood about living that you've somehow missed in all your achieving?",
  "system3": "She understood how to *be* without having to *prove*. She'd survived the war, came here with nothing, and somehow she could just... sit. Be still. I remember watching her light candles on Friday nights - this look on her face like she was connected to something bigger than all of us.\n\nI've never been able to do that. There's always another mountain to climb, another company to build, another board meeting to dominate. But I'm starting to wonder if I've been chasing the wrong things entirely. Like maybe the answer isn't in building something bigger, but in learning how to stop building altogether.\n\nMy husband says I'm addicted to the chase. Maybe he's right.",
  "user3": "That contrast between her ability to simply *be* after surviving such profound loss, and your inability to stop chasing despite having everything - it's like you're living proof that security and success don't automatically create peace. Your grandmother found something in the stillness that all your building hasn't given you.\n\nWhat would it mean for you to stop building altogether? What are you afraid you might discover in that stillness you've been avoiding?",
  "system4": "That I'm... nothing without the chase. That without the next deal, the next board seat, the next whatever\u2014I don't know who I am. I've been Ellen the entrepreneur, Ellen the investor, Ellen the woman who built and sold companies. Strip all that away and what's left?\n\nMaybe that's why I keep coming back to these medicines. They're the only things that force me to stop. Even if it's just temporary. Even if I spend most of the time fighting it.\n\nI think about my kids - they know me as someone who's always half somewhere else. Always checking email, always planning the next thing. What if they grow up and realize I was never really *there*?",
  "user4": "That fear of being nothing without the chase - it's like you've built your entire identity on shifting sand, and now you're wondering what remains when the tide comes in. The image of your kids knowing you as someone who's always half elsewhere... that's painful to sit with.\n\nIt sounds like you're facing two core questions: *Who am I when I stop achieving?* and *Can I learn to be truly present before it's too late for my kids to know that version of me?*\n\nI'm hearing three main threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding your authentic self beneath all the roles and achievements - discovering who Ellen is when she's not building or chasing\n2. Learning to be present and still, like your grandmother was, connected to something deeper than quarterly projections\n3. Becoming someone your kids can feel fully connected to, not just physically there but mentally elsewhere\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your ibogaine journey.",
  "system5": "Yes. That's... that's exactly it. I've never been able to put it that clearly before. \n\nI keep thinking about what my grandmother would say if she saw me now\u2014this woman who's built everything but somehow has nothing solid inside. She'd probably just smile and tell me to sit down and be quiet for once. Maybe that's what I need to learn how to do.\n\nSo how do I turn those three things into... whatever intentions are supposed to be?",
  "user5": "Based on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. **I open myself to discovering who I am beneath all I've built and achieved**\n2. **I embrace learning to be still and present, connected to something deeper than external success**\n3. **I seek to become fully available to my children and loved ones, not just physically but with my whole being**\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system6": "The first one hits hardest. \"I open myself to discovering who I am beneath all I've built and achieved.\" That feels like the core of everything\u2014like if I could just figure that out, maybe the rest would follow.\n\nBut... I don't know. Saying it like that feels kind of... soft? Like it needs to be stronger. More direct. I'm used to setting goals that are measurable, concrete. This intention thing feels so... vague.\n\nWhat if I said something like \"I will confront who I've become without my achievements to hide behind\"? Would that work, or am I missing the point entirely?",
  "user6": "I hear that need for something stronger, more direct - you're used to charging at things head-on, not gently opening to them. But your version has that confrontational energy that might actually close you off during the medicine experience rather than creating space for discovery.\n\nWhat if you kept the strength but shifted from confrontation to curiosity? Something like \"I reclaim my authentic self beyond achievements and external validation\" - still direct, but with movement toward rather than against.\n\nHow does that feel?",
  "system7": "I reclaim my authentic self beyond achievements and external validation...\n\nThat's better. It's got direction to it, like I'm going somewhere instead of just... sitting around waiting for something to happen. But it's still not quite right. I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nWhat about the other two? How would you make those stronger? Because I think I need all three. I can't just figure out who I am and then still be the mom who's checking her phone during her daughter's piano recital.",
  "user7": "For the second one, what about: \"I reclaim the art of stillness and presence my grandmother knew\u2014the ability to *be* without *proving*\"\n\nAnd the third: \"I commit to showing up fully for my children with my complete attention and presence\"\n\nThese feel more active, like you're deliberately choosing something rather than just hoping it happens. How do these land for you?",
  "system8": "Those work. They're... I don't know, they feel like something I can actually do. Not just wishy-washy hope for the best kind of stuff.\n\nI reclaim my authentic self beyond achievements and external validation.\nI reclaim the art of stillness and presence my grandmother knew\u2014the ability to *be* without *proving*.\nI commit to showing up fully for my children with my complete attention and presence.\n\nYeah. I'll write these down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "user8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I reclaim my authentic self beyond achievements and external validation\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim the art of stillness and presence my grandmother knew\u2014the ability to *be* without *proving*\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I commit to showing up fully for my children with my complete attention and presence\n\nPerfect choice - keeping them in your wallet means they'll be there when you're tempted to check email during dinner or when you're lying awake planning the next quarter. These are your compass now, not your destination.\n\nYour three powerful intentions for this ibogaine journey:\n1. I reclaim my authentic self beyond achievements and external validation\n2. I reclaim the art of stillness and presence my grandmother knew\u2014the ability to *be* without *proving*\n3. I commit to showing up fully for my children with my complete attention and presence\n\nYour chosen ritual: Keep them in your wallet\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The ibogaine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you strength on this journey. Courage to see yourself clearly and compassion for whoever you find underneath all that building.",
  "system9": "Thank you. I... I needed this. Someone to help me get clear on what I'm actually looking for instead of just spinning my wheels thinking I need another business win or investment opportunity.\n\nI keep thinking about what my grandmother would say. She'd probably just pat my hand and tell me to stop trying so hard. Maybe that's what these intentions are really about\u2014learning how to stop trying so hard and just... be.\n\nAnyway. I have them written down now. That's something.",
  "user9": "You're welcome. There's something powerful about having these distilled down to their essence - no more spinning, just three clear directions to hold onto.\n\nYour grandmother sounds like she knew something about the wisdom of just being. Maybe these intentions are your way of finally hearing what she's been trying to tell you all along.\n\nSafe travels on this journey. You've done the hard work of getting honest about what you actually need. The rest is just showing up.",
  "system10": "Yeah. Maybe that's all it is\u2014just showing up. I've been so busy trying to control outcomes and optimize everything that I forgot how to just... be there. \n\nMy grandmother would probably laugh if she knew I needed plant medicine to figure out something she lived every day without thinking about it. But maybe that's the point. Maybe some of us need to lose our way completely before we can find our way back to something real.\n\nThanks for helping me get clear. Really.",
  "user10": "That's it exactly - sometimes we need to get completely lost before we can even see what we've been missing. Your grandmother's wisdom lived in her bones, passed down through generations. Ours takes a more circuitous route sometimes.\n\nYou found your way back to something real today. These intentions aren't just words on paper - they're your way home.\n\nTake good care of yourself through this. You know where to find me if you need anything.",
  "system11": "I will. And... I might check in after. If that's okay. This stuff doesn't exactly come naturally to me, and I have a feeling I'm going to need help making sense of whatever comes up.\n\nBut for now, I need to go pick up my daughter from school. And maybe leave my phone in the car this time.",
  "user11": "Absolutely - check in anytime. Integration takes time, and having someone to help make sense of it all can make the difference between a powerful experience and lasting change.\n\nGo be with your daughter. Leave that phone in the car. One small moment of presence at a time - that's how this works.\n\nI'll be here when you're ready.",
  "system12": "Good. That's... good to know. \n\nSee you around, I guess.",
  "user12": "See you around. \n\nGo get your girl.",
  "system13": "I will. Thanks again.",
  "user13": "You're welcome. Go be her dad.",
  "system14": "*I am now Ellen, three weeks after my ibogaine journey at Beond. I'm sitting in my car outside my daughter's school, early for pickup, feeling raw and disoriented from what the medicine showed me.*\n\nI... I don't know how to talk about what happened. The medicine took me places I wasn't expecting. It wasn't gentle like the others. It stripped everything down to the bone.\n\nI saw myself from the outside - this woman obsessed with achievements, collecting them like they could fill some hole inside her. But the hole just kept getting bigger. And my kids... God, I saw how I look to them. Half-there, always distracted, promising to play but checking my phone.\n\nThe worst part? I saw my grandmother watching me. Not disappointed, just... sad. Like she was waiting for me to remember something I used to know.\n\nI haven't looked at my intentions since I got back. I'm scared to. What if I failed? What if I can't be who I thought I could be?",
  "user14": "Ellen, you're not supposed to be someone new yet. You're just supposed to be honest about what you saw - and you're doing that right now.\n\nThat rawness you're feeling? That's not failure. That's the medicine still working on you, showing you what you needed to see, not what you wanted to see.\n\nYour grandmother wasn't sad because you failed. She was sad because she could see how hard you were being on yourself, how long you've been carrying this alone.\n\nWant to look at those intentions together? Not to judge how you're doing, but to see if they still feel true after everything the medicine showed you.",
  "system15": "I... okay. Yeah. Let me find them.\n\n*I dig through my wallet, fingers shaking slightly. The paper's crumpled, worn soft at the edges.*\n\nHere they are. \"Stop performing and start being present.\" \"Trust the wisdom of enough.\" \"Let love be my only ambition.\"\n\nThey feel different now. Before, they were like... goals to achieve. Checkboxes. But after seeing myself through the medicine's eyes - seeing how I've been performing my life instead of living it - they feel heavier. More real. Like instructions for how to breathe instead of suffocate.\n\nThe being present one hits hardest. I watched myself miss so many moments with my kids, with David. Always planning the next thing, optimizing, strategizing. Even when I was holding them, part of me was already somewhere else.\n\nHow do you stop doing that? How do you just... be here?",
  "user15": "You just did it. Right now. You noticed you were somewhere else, and you came back. That's the whole practice - not being perfect, just noticing when you're gone and returning.\n\nThe medicine showed you the truth, but it didn't give you a new personality. You're still Ellen with her phone and her planner and her need to get it right. The difference is now you know what it costs when you leave.\n\nYour kids don't need a perfect present mom. They just need you to notice when you're not really there, and come back. Like you're doing right now, sitting in this car, feeling your hands on the wheel.\n\nWhat if \"being present\" isn't about changing who you are, but about catching yourself when you drift? What if it's as simple as feeling your breath before you open the car door?",
  "system16": "*I grip the steering wheel tighter, feeling the leather under my palms. My breath catches - I can't remember the last time I actually felt my hands on this wheel.*\n\nThat's... that's actually something I can do. Not some huge transformation, just... noticing. My daughter's going to come running out those doors in about ten minutes, and for once I could actually be here when she does.\n\nBut I'm scared. What if I mess it up? What if I try to be more present but keep falling into the same patterns? The medicine showed me how many years I've been this way - climbing, achieving, always reaching for the next thing. It's like my default setting.\n\nAnd what about work? The boards, the investments, the meetings... they still expect the old Ellen. The one who responds to emails at 10pm and has solutions before people finish explaining problems. How do I show up as this new version of me when everyone still wants the performer?",
  "user16": "You're going to mess it up. That's guaranteed. The question isn't whether you'll fall back into old patterns - you will. The question is whether you'll notice when you do, and come back without beating yourself up about it.\n\nTen years of climbing doesn't get rewritten in three weeks. But it *does* get seen clearly now, and that's what changes everything.\n\nAs for work... what if you don't announce a new version of yourself? What if you just start small? Like not answering emails after 8pm. Like taking a full breath before you respond to requests. Like letting people finish their sentences without already having the solution ready.\n\nThe old Ellen got you here. She's not the enemy - she's just exhausted from carrying all that alone. You don't have to fire her. You just have to give her some boundaries, some rest, some help.\n\nYour daughter's going to come running out soon. Can you feel your feet on the floor of the car right now? That's enough for this moment.",
  "system17": "*I shift in my seat, actually feeling the weight of my feet in these expensive shoes I bought because some article said successful women wear these. Feeling the floor of the car beneath them. It's such a small thing, but it's real.*\n\nMy feet are here. I'm here. \n\nAnd you're right about work - I don't have to make some big announcement. I can just... not answer that email from the West Coast board member who always sends things at 11pm their time. It can wait until morning. The world won't end.\n\n*I glance at the school doors, then back at my phone. 47 new emails. My thumb hovers over the icon.*\n\nGod, this is hard. The pull to just check them, to feel that hit of importance, of being needed... it's like a drug. The medicine showed me how I've been using work like that - like a way to feel valuable when I'm scared I'm not enough just sitting here being Ellen.\n\nBut my daughter's going to come through those doors looking for her mom. Not the CEO, not the board member, not the investor. Just her mom.\n\n*I put the phone in the glove compartment.*\n\nOkay. Feet on the floor. Hands on the wheel. Breathing. That's it. That's enough for right now.",
  "user17": "*I can hear the soft thud of the phone settling into the glove compartment.*\n\nThere. You just chose her. You chose the real thing over the performance.\n\nThat itch you're feeling right now - the pull to check, to feel needed, to matter - that's the addiction the medicine showed you. And you're sitting with it instead of feeding it. That's the bravest thing anyone can do.\n\nYour daughter's going to come through those doors and she won't know what just happened in this car. She won't know her mom just broke a ten-year habit to be here for her. But she'll feel it. Kids always feel when we're actually here.\n\nThe emails will still be there at 6pm. But this moment - her running toward you with her whole heart - this only happens today.\n\nHow does it feel in your body right now, choosing her over the noise?",
  "system18": "*My chest feels tight, like there's a hand pressing down on it. My legs are restless, bouncing slightly. But there's something else too - this quiet space opening up, like when you hold your breath underwater and everything gets still.*\n\nIt feels like... panic and peace at the same time. My nervous system is screaming that I'm falling behind, that something important is happening without me. But deeper than that, there's this relief. Like I've been holding my breath for years and just now realized I could exhale.\n\n*I close my eyes for a second, feeling the strangeness of choosing not to know. Choosing not to respond. Choosing not to matter to those people right now.*\n\nI feel naked. Like without the constant buzzing of demands and expectations, I'm just... here. Ellen in a car. A mom waiting for her kid. Nothing special happening except everything that actually matters.\n\n*The school doors start to open. Kids spilling out, parents gathering.*\n\nGod, I want to check that phone so badly. But I want to see her face more. I want to be the mom who's actually looking at her when she runs over.\n\nThis feels like jumping off a cliff. But maybe I've been falling this whole time, and this is the first moment I'm choosing to land.",
  "user18": "*Watching the kids stream out, watching you watch them.*\n\nThere she is. Coming toward you with her whole heart, not knowing her mom just did the bravest thing she's done in years.\n\nYou landed. You're here. You chose her.\n\nFeel your feet, Ellen. Feel your hands on this wheel. You just did the impossible - you stayed when every part of you wanted to run back to the noise.\n\nYour daughter won't know what you just did. But she'll feel it in her bones - her mom saw her today. Really saw her.\n\nThat's enough. That's everything.",
  "system19": "*She's running toward me, backpack bouncing, hair flying behind her, that gap-toothed smile that makes my chest hurt. And I'm actually here for it - not half somewhere else, not already thinking about dinner and homework and tomorrow's meeting. Just here.*\n\nMommy! Guess what happened in art class!\n\n*Her voice cuts through everything, through all the noise in my head. She's reaching for the door handle and I can feel tears starting, which is ridiculous but also...*\n\nWhat, baby? What happened?\n\n*She climbs in, all limbs and excitement, and I can smell crayons and playground and that little kid smell that's disappearing too fast.*\n\nI made you something! It's a surprise! You have to wait until we get home!\n\n*I catch her eye in the rearview mirror as I pull away from the curb, and she's grinning like she knows a secret. Like she can tell I'm actually here today.*\n\nI can't wait to see it. I'm so proud of you.\n\n*The words come out different than usual - slower, real. And I realize this is the first time I've said them today without checking my phone between sentences.*\n\nI'm proud of you too, Mommy.\n\n*My hands grip the wheel and I can feel it - this tiny thread between us, pulling tight. Not broken. Not yet.",
  "user19": "*That thread's been there the whole time, hasn't it? Just waiting for you to pick it up again.*\n\nShe knows. Kids always know when we're really here. When we're not just going through the motions.\n\nYou did it. You stayed. You chose her over the noise, and she felt it land in her little body.\n\nFeel that grip on the wheel - that's you holding onto this moment. Onto her. Onto yourself.\n\nThe emails can wait. This can't."
