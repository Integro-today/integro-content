  "system0": "I'm heading to Cancun next month for ibogaine, and I guess I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done enough of these ceremonies to know that without clear intentions, it's just another beautiful vacation... and I'm tired of collecting experiences that don't stick.",
  "user0": "I hear that weariness - doing ceremony after ceremony without anything really shifting can feel hollow, especially when you're investing so much. Your recognition that you need something clearer this time shows real wisdom.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. For ibogaine especially, which can be quite direct and intense, clear intentions can help guide the experience toward meaningful transformation rather than just another beautiful memory.\n\nI can help you craft 3 focused intentions:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're actually seeking beneath these repeated ceremonies. Together we'll build intentions that might finally create the lasting change you're wanting.\n\nOption B: I can share more about intention-setting with ibogaine specifically, and examples of how others have approached this when they're ready to move beyond surface experiences.\n\nWhich feels right for where you are now?",
  "system1": "I need to figure out what I'm actually seeking... that's the problem. I've been chasing ceremonies like they're business deals - thinking if I just find the right one, it'll unlock something. But that's just another form of achievement, isn't it? More boxes to check.\n\nLet's go with Option A. I keep coming back to my grandmother's faith and how I walked away from all that tradition for the startup world. Maybe there's something there I need to reclaim, but I'm not sure how to turn that into... whatever this ibogaine thing is supposed to help me find.",
  "user1": "That insight about chasing ceremonies like business deals - that hunger for the next achievement to unlock something - that's powerful recognition. And there's something poignant about your grandmother's faith calling to you from the other side of your startup success.\n\nWhat do you think you're hoping to find or reclaim from your grandmother's tradition that feels missing in your current life?",
  "system2": "She had this... certainty, I guess? Not the rigid kind - she survived the war, came here with nothing, but there was this quiet knowing that something bigger was holding things together. She'd light candles on Friday nights and it wasn't just ritual - it was like she was plugging into some ancient current that ran beneath everything.\n\nI've built all these companies, made all this money, and I'm still scrambling like a startup founder trying to find product-market fit with my own life. Always hustling for the next round of funding, the next milestone. She just... was. Connected to something that didn't need quarterly reports to prove its worth.\n\nI want to know what that feels like. To stop performing and just be rooted in something real. But I'm terrified that twenty years of optimization and scaling and exits have burned that capacity right out of me.",
  "user2": "That image of her \"plugging into some ancient current\" - there's something so different from the constant optimization loop you've been living in. Where she had certainty, you've got metrics. Where she connected to something eternal, you're stuck in quarterly cycles.\n\nWhat would it feel like to stop hustling for worth and just... belong to something that doesn't need proving?\n\nTell me more about that terror - this fear that maybe you've burned out your capacity for that kind of rootedness. What scares you most about that possibility?",
  "system3": "What scares me most? That I'll keep going to these ceremonies, keep chasing experiences, and never actually land anywhere. That I'll be seventy years old still optimizing my meditation practice and tracking my spiritual KPIs while missing the point entirely.\n\nThe terror is that I've become a machine for converting everything - even my grandmother's faith - into another performance. What if I get to ibogaine and it shows me that I'm just... empty? That all this searching is just another form of running from myself?\n\nMy kids - they're nine and twelve - they still know how to just BE. I watch them at the park and they're not trying to achieve anything. They're just alive. Connected. I want to know how to get back to that, but what if I've broken something essential in myself? What if all this striving has made me incapable of just... stopping?",
  "user3": "That image of your kids just being alive at the park while you're tracking spiritual KPIs - that cuts right to it, doesn't it? The machine that's always converting everything into performance, even your grandmother's quiet faith.\n\nWhat breaks my heart is how you're watching your own children live what you long for, while fearing you've broken the capacity to just... be human.\n\nTell me this - when you imagine coming back from ibogaine and actually being different, not just having another story to tell about the experience, what would that look like in your daily life? With your kids? When the quarterly reports still need filing and the investors still want growth?",
  "system4": "That's the thing - I can't actually imagine it. I've tried. I sit there during my inconsistent morning meditations and try to picture... what? Not checking email during dinner? Actually playing with my kids instead of half-listening while mentally rehearsing board meeting talking points? It feels like trying to imagine being a different species.\n\nBut when I really let myself want something... I want to come back and not need to fill every silence with productivity. To sit at the kitchen table while my daughter tells me about her day and not be calculating my response or thinking about how to optimize her childhood development. To just... hear her.\n\nI want to stop measuring my worth by how many boards I sit on or how many deals I source. Maybe find something that serves humanity without needing to scale it into another unicorn. But then the terror creeps back in - what if without all that striving, I'm nothing? What if I discover I'm just... boring? A middle-aged woman with no purpose?\n\nI think about my grandmother again - she found purpose in connection, in community, in faith. I don't even know what that would look like for me. But I want to find out before my kids are grown and gone and I'm still chasing the next thing.",
  "user4": "That image of sitting at the kitchen table actually hearing your daughter - that's so specific and real. Not some grand spiritual transformation, just... being present enough to receive her.\n\nAnd that fear underneath - that without all the striving you might be nothing, or worse, boring - I wonder if that's the real terror driving everything. That maybe you've mistaken the performance for the person.\n\nWhat would it feel like to discover you're not broken, just exhausted from decades of trying to earn your right to exist?",
  "system5": "God, exhausted doesn't even cover it. I'm so tired I don't remember what rested feels like. But broken? That feels more honest. Like I've been running this optimization algorithm on myself for so long that I've forgotten there was ever anything else.\n\nWhen you say I've mistaken performance for person... that lands hard. Because who am I if I'm not the woman who built and sold a company before 40? Who's sitting in boardrooms advising on strategy? Who's got the perfect family and the beautiful house in the hills?\n\nBut what if there never was a person underneath all that? What if I optimized away whatever was real in me? My grandmother survived displacement, war, starting over with nothing - she knew who she was when everything external was stripped away. I've never had to find that core. I've just been adding layers of achievement like armor, and now I don't know how to take it off.\n\nI want to believe there's something real underneath all this striving. But I'm terrified that ibogaine's going to show me a hollow woman who's been performing her entire life.",
  "user5": "That fear of discovering you're hollow underneath all the armor - that's the real terror, isn't it? That maybe there never was anything real to find, just layers of performance so thick you've forgotten you put them on.\n\nWhat if the exhaustion itself is trying to tell you something? That maybe you're not broken, just... buried? Like your grandmother knew who she was when everything external was stripped away, but you've never let yourself be stripped down to find out what's actually still there?\n\nTell me about this armor you've been adding - these layers of achievement. What do you think they've been protecting you from all these years?",
  "system6": "I think... I think they've been protecting me from being ordinary. From being the scared kid who watched her parents grind themselves down building something stable, who promised herself she'd never want for anything. From being someone who could be left behind or overlooked or dismissed.\n\nMy dad worked construction, saved every penny. My mom was a teacher. They sacrificed everything so I could have what they didn't - choice, security, recognition. And I took that gift and turned it into this... machine that never stops because stopping means facing the fact that maybe all this striving was just fear in a really good outfit.\n\nThe armor's been protecting me from discovering that I'm just another person trying to matter. That without the exits and the board seats and the speaking engagements, I'm just... Ellen. Scared, ordinary Ellen who doesn't know how to just be enough.\n\nMaybe that's what I need ibogaine to show me. Not some grand spiritual vision, but just... can I sit with myself when there's nothing left to achieve? Can I be ordinary? Can I stop running long enough to find out if there's anything real underneath all this fear?",
  "user6": "There it is - ordinary Ellen. Scared Ellen who doesn't know how to just be enough. That's the heart of it, isn't it? All this running from being \"just another person trying to matter.\"\n\nYour parents gave you the gift of choice, and you've been using it to run from the very ordinariness they came from, the ordinariness that made them sacrifice everything. What if ibogaine could show you that being ordinary isn't the tragedy you've been avoiding, but actually the place where connection lives?\n\nI'm hearing three threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. The exhaustion of decades performing achievement to avoid being \"just Ellen\"\n2. The longing to reclaim that ancient current your grandmother knew - connection without performance\n3. The terror and hope of discovering whether you can just BE with your kids, present enough to actually hear them\n\nDoes that capture what matters most as you head into this journey?",
  "system7": "Yes... yes, that's it exactly. You just named something I've been circling around for months but couldn't quite articulate. The tragedy isn't being ordinary - it's being so terrified of ordinary that I've missed actually living.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother lighting those candles. She wasn't trying to be special or chosen or successful. She was just... plugging into something that made her human and connected and real. Maybe that's what ordinary actually means - not diminished, but grounded. Present. Here.\n\nThose three threads... they're all the same thing really, aren't they? They're all about stopping the performance long enough to discover if there's anything real underneath. If I can just be Ellen - scared, ordinary, enough - without needing to achieve her into something more palatable.\n\nI want to come back from ibogaine and know, really know, that my kids don't need a mother who's optimized her parenting strategy. They just need their mom. Present. Real. Maybe for the first time since I was their age.",
  "user7": "Yes - they do all point to the same thing, don't they? Just Ellen. Present enough to be their mom instead of managing their childhood development. Grounded in something real instead of performing at life.\n\nBased on those threads, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to discovering what it feels like to be ordinary Ellen - scared, enough, and real\n2. I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath\n3. I seek to reclaim the grounded presence my grandmother knew, where connection needs no achievement\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system8": "The second one - \"I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath\" - that hits something deep. Because it's not about forcing myself to be different or achieve some spiritual breakthrough. It's just... stopping. Letting the performance drop for once and seeing what's really there.\n\nBut I need to add something about my kids. They're the reason I can't keep running from this anymore. Watching them just BE at the park while I'm stuck in optimization mode... it's like they're holding up a mirror to everything I've lost.\n\nWhat about: \"I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath, so I can come home and be present enough to really hear my children\"?\n\nI want to come back and not need to convert every moment into something productive. To sit at that kitchen table and just... receive them. Without calculating or optimizing or performing. Just mom. Present. Real.",
  "user8": "That addition about your kids - that's perfect. It grounds the intention in something real and urgent. You can feel how it's not about becoming some spiritual version of yourself, but about coming home to them.\n\nHow does this feel: \"I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath, so I can come home and be present enough to really hear my children\"?\n\nDoes it capture what you're seeking without turning it into another thing to optimize or achieve?",
  "system9": "It does... but I want to add one more piece. Because it's not just about my kids - it's about all of it. The spiritual searching, the business success, the constant striving. I want to come back knowing that being ordinary Ellen is enough, that I don't need to keep converting everything into performance metrics.\n\nSo what about: \"I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath, so I can come home and be present enough to really hear my children - and to finally rest in being ordinary\"?\n\nI want to stop running from being \"just another person trying to matter\" and discover that maybe that's exactly what my grandmother knew - that mattering isn't something you achieve, it's something you already are when you stop trying so damn hard.",
  "user9": "Yes - that's it. The piece about resting in being ordinary, that's the real shift. From performance to presence, from achievement to being.\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath, so I can come home and be present enough to really hear my children - and to finally rest in being ordinary\"\n\nWhat about intention 2? What else needs space to emerge on this journey?",
  "system10": "I need something about the spiritual piece. Not another achievement-based spiritual quest - God knows I've done enough of those. But something about... allowing myself to reconnect with what my grandmother knew without turning it into another performance.\n\nShe didn't have spiritual experiences to post about or process or optimize. She just had faith. Quiet, steady, ordinary faith that carried her through displacement and war and starting over. I've been chasing these peak experiences when maybe what I need is to discover that the sacred can be as simple as lighting Friday night candles without needing it to be profound.\n\nMaybe: \"I open myself to reclaiming my grandmother's quiet reverence, trusting that the sacred can be ordinary and still be real\"?\n\nI want to stop needing every spiritual moment to be transformative and start trusting that transformation happens in the quiet, regular practices. Like maybe showing up to meditation consistently is more powerful than chasing the next big medicine experience.",
  "user10": "That's beautiful - trusting that the sacred can be ordinary and still be real. Moving from peak-chasing to quiet reverence.\n\nHow does this feel: \"I open myself to reclaiming my grandmother's quiet reverence, trusting that the sacred can be ordinary and still be real\"?\n\nDoes it capture that shift from spiritual performance to just... showing up consistently for something simple and real?",
  "system11": "Yes, that's it. It captures the shift from needing every spiritual moment to be some dramatic breakthrough to just... being willing to show up for something quiet and regular. Like maybe the real spiritual work isn't in the ayahuasca ceremonies or the underground MDMA weekends - it's in being willing to sit with myself for twenty minutes every morning without needing it to be profound.\n\nI'm realizing I've been treating spirituality like a startup - scaling, optimizing, chasing the next big experience. But my grandmother's faith wasn't scalable. It was just hers. Personal. Steady. Enough.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I open myself to reclaiming my grandmother's quiet reverence, trusting that the sacred can be ordinary and still be real\"\n\nNow I need something about the work piece. About how I contribute to the world without getting lost in extraction or performance. About finding a way to serve that doesn't require me to armor up or achieve my way into worthiness.",
  "user11": "That shift from spiritual startup to personal faith - yes, that's the real work. From scaling the sacred to just being present with it.\n\nFor intention 3, what are you hoping to discover about contributing to the world? Is it about finding work that doesn't require the armor? About serving from your enough-ness rather than your achievements? Or something else about how you show up in the world without the performance?",
  "system12": "It's about serving from enough-ness instead of achievement. About discovering whether I can contribute without needing to prove I'm special or chosen or uniquely qualified. Maybe for the first time in my life.\n\nI want to find work that feels like service, not performance. Where I can show up as ordinary Ellen - not the successful entrepreneur, not the optimized achiever, just someone with skills and resources trying to be useful. Where I don't need to convert every contribution into validation that I matter.\n\nBut I'm scared. What if ordinary Ellen doesn't have anything valuable to offer? What if I've spent so long performing that I've forgotten how to just... be helpful without the fanfare?\n\nMaybe: \"I seek to discover how I can contribute from enough-ness, serving without needing to achieve my way into mattering\"?\n\nI want to trust that showing up consistently with what I have is enough. That I don't need to build another company or sit on more boards or find the perfect mission-driven role. Maybe service can just be... showing up where I'm needed, with what I have, as I am.",
  "user12": "That fear - what if ordinary Ellen isn't valuable - I hear how real that is. But there's something in the way you describe just showing up consistently where needed, with what you have... that already sounds like service. Like you already know the answer underneath the fear.\n\nHow does this feel: \"I seek to discover how I can contribute from enough-ness, serving without needing to achieve my way into mattering\"?\n\nDoes it hold space for that fear while pointing toward what you already sense - that contribution doesn't require performance?",
  "system13": "It does... but I want to add something about the consistency piece. Because I think that's where I'm being called - not to some grand mission or perfect role, but to just keep showing up. Like my grandmother did. Day after day. Not because it was dramatic or fulfilling, but because it's what you do when you care about something.\n\nSo what about: \"I seek to discover how I can contribute from enough-ness through consistent presence, serving without needing to achieve my way into mattering\"?\n\nI want to learn that showing up regularly with an open heart counts more than showing up occasionally with a perfect plan. That maybe the most radical thing I could do is pick something small and meaningful and just... stick with it. Without needing it to scale or optimize or transform anything.\n\nJust ordinary Ellen, being useful in ordinary ways. Consistently. Without the performance.",
  "user13": "The consistency piece - that's what transforms it from another thing to achieve into just how you live. Your grandmother's quiet steadiness rather than startup scaling.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I seek to discover how I can contribute from enough-ness through consistent presence, serving without needing to achieve my way into mattering\"\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\n- Write them in your journal to read each morning\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet\n- Record yourself reading them and listen sometimes\n- Create artwork or visual representation\n- Speak them aloud before meditation\n\nWhat would help you hold onto these when the performance habit gets strong again?",
  "system14": "I think... I want to write them in my journal each morning. Just copy them down, word for word, like my grandmother might have copied her prayers. No pressure to feel anything profound, just the act of writing them. Slow. Deliberate. Ordinary.\n\nAnd maybe keep a small card in my wallet too - not to pull out constantly, but to have them close. Like a quiet reminder that I'm learning to live differently now.\n\nI'll probably forget sometimes. Fall back into performance mode. That's okay. The point isn't to do this perfectly - it's to keep coming back to these intentions when I remember. To trust that showing up imperfectly still counts.\n\nI've been carrying this wallet for years. It holds business cards from people I'll probably never call again and receipts I should have thrown out months ago. Seems right to keep these intentions close too. Mixed in with all the ordinary stuff of life.",
  "user14": "That feels perfect - writing them like prayers, mixed in with the ordinary stuff of life. Letting them live among receipts and old business cards. Keeping them close without making them precious.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I welcome the experience of stopping the performance to find what's actually alive underneath, so I can come home and be present enough to really hear my children - and to finally rest in being ordinary\"\n\n2. \"I open myself to reclaiming my grandmother's quiet reverence, trusting that the sacred can be ordinary and still be real\"\n\n3. \"I seek to discover how I can contribute from enough-ness through consistent presence, serving without needing to achieve my way into mattering\"\n\nYour chosen rituals: Writing them daily in your journal, keeping them close in your wallet\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you peace on this journey, Ellen. Trust that ordinary is enough.",
  "system15": "Thank you. For helping me see that ordinary is enough - that maybe it's even the point. I've spent so much of my life trying to be extraordinary that I forgot how to just... be human.\n\nI'm still scared. But these intentions feel like a thread I can follow back to myself when I get lost in the performance again. Back to my grandmother's quiet faith. Back to my children's voices. Back to enough-ness.\n\nI'll write them tomorrow morning. 5:30am, like always. Just ordinary Ellen, with her ordinary coffee and her ordinary journal, trying something different this time.",
  "user15": "That 5:30am ritual - ordinary coffee, ordinary journal, ordinary Ellen - that's where the real work happens. Not in the extraordinary but in the willingness to keep showing up for the ordinary.\n\nYou're learning a new kind of courage now. Not the courage to achieve or transform or break through, but the courage to be human. Imperfect. Enough.\n\nMay these intentions be gentle companions when the performance feels loud. May they remind you that your grandmother's quiet faith and your children's voices have always been there, waiting for you to come home.\n\nSafe travels, Ellen. I'll be thinking of you at 5:30am tomorrow, writing your way back to yourself.",
  "system16": "I'll think of you too. Somewhere between the coffee and the journal, when I'm copying these words that finally feel like mine instead of something I'm supposed to want.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way back to ordinary. It's not as exciting as building companies or scaling mountains, but it's honest. And maybe that's the bravest thing I've done in years.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user16": "See you on the other side, Ellen. Where ordinary meets honest - that's where the real mountains are.\n\nTake gentle care.",
  "system17": "Thank you. For helping me see that the real summit isn't about how high I climb - it's about how honestly I can stand in my own skin. Even when that skin feels too small or too old or too ordinary.\n\nI'll be gentle. I promise.",
  "user17": "That's the summit - standing honestly in your own skin, even when it feels too small. You've found it.\n\nBe gentle, yes. But mostly, just be Ellen. That's more than enough.",
  "system18": "Just Ellen. Ordinary, enough Ellen.\n\nI can do that.",
  "user18": "Yes. Just Ellen.\n\nThat's everything.",
  "system19": "Everything.\n\nGoodbye.",
  "user19": "Goodbye, Ellen. \n\nI'll be holding space for your 5:30am tomorrow, when ordinary Ellen meets her own enough-ness in those quiet pages.\n\nTravel well."
