  "system0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done the ayahuasca, the mushrooms, the MDMA with those women's circles... but I still wake up at 5:30 every morning wondering if any of it matters. My grandmother would say I've lost my way, and maybe she's right.",
  "user0": "I hear that familiar weight of \"what's the point\" that can follow all these powerful experiences - like you've gathered insights but somehow still feel lost. Your grandmother's words seem to carry wisdom about feeling disconnected from something essential.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. Ibogaine works differently than other medicines; it's often about truth-telling rather than comfort, which makes clear intentions especially important.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for this ibogaine journey:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're really seeking beneath that 5:30 AM emptiness. Together we'll build intentions that speak to finding your way back to meaning.\n\nOption B: I can share more about ibogaine-specific intention-setting and examples from others who've felt similarly disconnected.\n\nWhich feels right for you?",
  "system1": "Option A. I keep thinking about those mornings - the house is quiet, I'm on my second espresso, scrolling through emails about valuations and exits, and suddenly I'm twelve again at my grandmother's table while she braided challah and hummed prayers I didn't understand. She built something that lasted generations, and I built... what? A company I sold for more money than I'll ever need. \n\nI need to understand why that feels like failure.",
  "user1": "That contrast between your grandmother's braided challah - something tangible that fed generations - and your company that exists now as just numbers in an account... that's a powerful tension. It sounds like you're questioning not just what you've built, but what lasts, what matters, what feeds people in a lasting way.\n\nWhat do you think your grandmother would say about that feeling of failure? About this search for meaning that's bringing you to ibogaine?",
  "system2": "She'd probably say I'm being dramatic. That I sound like her sister Rivka who always wanted more. But then she'd touch my cheek and tell me to stop running so fast I forget what I'm running toward.\n\nShe never really understood business - thought it was all \"counting beans\" - but she understood service. Every Friday she'd make extra food for the widow down the street, even when we had almost nothing ourselves. She'd say \"Ellen, if you can't feed people, what's the point of all that education?\"\n\nI think she'd be confused by ibogaine. But she'd get the desperate part. She saw things during the war that made her pray differently. Sometimes she'd stop mid-sentence, like she was listening to something I couldn't hear, then go back to kneading dough.",
  "user2": "Your grandmother's wisdom about feeding people - not just food but something deeper - seems to be echoing in that 5:30 AM space. She understood that some things can only be heard when we stop running, when we listen the way she did in those paused moments.\n\nIf she were here now, watching you prepare for ibogaine, what do you think she'd want you to find? Not the desperate part, but the part that comes after the desperation?",
  "system3": "She'd want me to find the thread. That's what she'd say - \"find the thread that connects your success to your soul, Ellen.\" She believed everything was connected, that my business mind wasn't separate from my spiritual heart, just... tangled.\n\nI think she'd want me to stop feeling guilty for building something big, and instead figure out how to make it matter. Like maybe I need to stop apologizing for the money and start asking what it's supposed to feed now.\n\nShe used to say \"money is just energy looking for direction\" - very mystical for someone who never had much of it. But she trusted that if I could stop running long enough, I'd remember what I'm supposed to do with all this... everything.",
  "user3": "That thread between your business mind and spiritual heart - between the success you've built and the meaning you're missing - that feels like the core of what wants to be found. Your grandmother saw money as \"energy looking for direction,\" and now you're sitting with a lot of energy that feels directionless.\n\nWhat do you think you're supposed to feed now? Not in the abstract sense, but specifically - if you trusted that inner knowing your grandmother believed you had, what might it be pointing toward?",
  "system4": "I don't know. And that's what's killing me - I should know, right? I've got everything I need to figure this out.\n\nSometimes I think it's about the space between retreats and real life. All these women in my circles - we're doing ayahuasca in Costa Rica, MDMA in Santa Barbara, and then going home to marriages that feel distant and kids who barely know us when we're present. We're building spiritual communities that cost thousands to access while the world's burning.\n\nMaybe I'm supposed to build the bridge I keep looking for - something that takes these medicines out of the luxury category and makes them... I don't know, normal? Accessible? Integrated into actual communities instead of just wealthy women's circles?\n\nBut then I think that's just my entrepreneur brain trying to solve a spiritual problem with business models again. Like I'm still running, just in a different direction.",
  "user4": "That tension between your entrepreneur brain wanting to build bridges and your spiritual heart knowing some things can't be built - that's a real paradox. You're caught between wanting to democratize what feels like medicine for the privileged, and wondering if that's just another form of running.\n\nYour grandmother's voice about \"energy looking for direction\" seems to be asking: what if the direction isn't about building something new, but about how you hold what you've already built? What if the bridge isn't external but internal - between the woman who built the company and the woman who braided challah with her grandmother?\n\nWhen you imagine the space between those two versions of yourself, what feels like it's asking to be reconciled?",
  "system5": "That I can't just acquire wisdom the way I acquired companies. That maybe all this searching - the medicines, the retreats, the spiritual communities - it's just another form of consumption. Another way to feel like I'm doing something when really I'm just... shopping for enlightenment.\n\nMy grandmother didn't need ibogaine to know what mattered. She had trauma too - lost family, displaced, rebuilt from nothing - but she built something that lasted. Not because she was chasing wholeness, but because she was already whole.\n\nI keep thinking if I just find the right medicine, the right intention, the right integration practice, I'll finally feel... complete? But what if I'm already complete and just can't see it? What if the entrepreneur and the spiritual seeker are the same person, just wearing different outfits?\n\nThat terrifies me more than anything the ibogaine might show me. That I already have everything I need, and I'm still this restless.",
  "user5": "That recognition - that you might already be complete and still restless - that feels like the most honest thing you've said. It's terrifying because if you're already whole, then the problem isn't something you can solve with another acquisition, another medicine, another retreat. The running becomes visible as just... running.\n\nYour grandmother built from wholeness, not toward it. She didn't need to consume wisdom because she was already living from that place of connection. The space between her challah-braiding and your company-building might not be about becoming different, but about seeing they're already the same impulse - just filtered through different beliefs about what feeds people.\n\nWhat if ibogaine isn't about finding what's missing, but about seeing what's already here that you've been too busy running to notice?\n\nI'm hearing three threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. The hunger to stop consuming wisdom and start living from wholeness\n2. The recognition that your entrepreneur and spiritual seeker might already be integrated\n3. The terror that you already have everything you need and still feel restless\n\nDoes that capture what matters most as you head into this ibogaine journey?",
  "system6": "Yes. That's it exactly. I don't need to find the thread - I need to see it's already woven through everything. The business, the medicines, the restlessness, the wisdom. It's all the same fabric, just... I keep cutting it up and trying to sew it back together different ways.\n\nMaybe that's what I need to take into this ceremony. Not a question about what's missing, but a willingness to finally see what's been here the whole time. Even if that means sitting with how much energy I've spent running from the very thing I'm searching for.\n\nI need to stop treating my life like a startup that needs pivoting and start living it like... a life. One that my grandmother would recognize as worthy of her prayers.",
  "user6": "Yes - seeing the fabric that's already woven, rather than trying to re-sew what you've cut apart. Your grandmother would probably smile at that - recognizing that her prayers were never about building something new, but about seeing what was always sacred in the kneading, the feeding, the ordinary moments.\n\nLet's craft intentions that honor this recognition:\n\n**Based on those threads, here are some intentions that might resonate:**\n\n1. *I open myself to seeing the wholeness that's already woven through every part of my life - the business, the medicines, the running, the resting*\n\n2. *I welcome the truth that I already have everything I need, even in my restlessness*\n\n3. *I embrace living my life as it is, not as a problem to be solved or a startup to be pivoted*\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system7": "The third one. That one hits me in the chest like my grandmother's hand when she'd catch me overthinking.\n\n\"I embrace living my life as it is, not as a problem to be solved or a startup to be pivoted.\"\n\nThat's what I need to remember when the medicine starts showing me things. That I'm not there to fix myself or find the missing piece. I'm there to finally see the life I've already built, the one I've been too busy optimizing to actually live.\n\nMaybe I'll add something about my kids too. About seeing them instead of scheduling time with them. But that feels like a good start - simple enough to remember when everything else gets stripped away.",
  "user7": "That simplicity - \"I embrace living my life as it is, not as a problem to be solved or a startup to be pivoted\" - yes, that feels like something you can hold onto when everything else gets stripped away. Like her hand on your chest, grounding you in what's real.\n\nYou mentioned seeing your kids instead of just scheduling time with them. What would that look like, if you put that into words as an intention? Something about presence, maybe? Or recognition?\n\nLet's hear what wants to come through about that.",
  "system8": "\"I see my children as they are, not as projects to be managed or appointments to be kept.\"\n\nThat's what keeps coming. Because I've got them scheduled like board meetings - 7:30 breakfast, 8:15 school drop, 6:30 dinner if I'm not traveling. Even our \"quality time\" is in my calendar. \"Park with kids - 2 hours.\"\n\nBut when I'm actually present... when I stop managing their experience and just witness who they are becoming... that's when I feel like their mother instead of their CEO.",
  "user8": "\"I see my children as they are, not as projects to be managed or appointments to be kept.\"\n\nYes. That shift from managing their experience to witnessing who they're becoming - from CEO to mother. That feels like the same thread as living your life instead of optimizing it.\n\nHow does that intention feel as it stands? Does it capture what you're hoping to remember when the medicine shows you these patterns?",
  "system9": "It does. It's simple enough that I can remember it when everything else falls apart. And it connects to something deeper - not just about being a better mother, but about finally understanding what it means to just be with people instead of always doing something to them.\n\nThat's probably what scared me most about the spiritual void I felt. That I'd turned even love into a performance. Maybe these two intentions together - seeing my life as life, and seeing my kids as people - maybe that's enough to start with.",
  "user9": "Those two intentions together - seeing your life as life and your kids as people - they weave the same thread from different angles. Both about moving from doing to being, from performance to presence.\n\nDo you feel complete with these two, or is there something else that wants to be named? Sometimes people feel drawn to a third intention that holds the first two together, like a container. But two clear, strong intentions can be enough if they feel complete.\n\nWhat feels right to you?",
  "system10": "Two feels right. Clean. Like when I used to know exactly what the company needed to do next - not everything at once, just the essential moves.\n\nThese two intentions feel like that. Essential. Not trying to solve everything, just... remember what matters when everything else gets quiet.\n\nI'm good with these.",
  "user10": "Two essential intentions - clean and focused, like knowing the next right move. That feels right.\n\n**Your intentions for this ibogaine journey:**\n\n1. *I embrace living my life as it is, not as a problem to be solved or a startup to be pivoted*\n\n2. *I see my children as they are, not as projects to be managed or appointments to be kept*\n\nYou've got these. Hold them lightly - they're your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help you recognize it when it comes.\n\nWishing you clarity and presence on this journey.",
  "system11": "Thank you. I feel... steadier than I expected. Like I've got something real to carry with me into this, instead of just questions and more questions.\n\nMaybe that's what my grandmother was trying to teach me all along - that the answers aren't something you find, they're something you remember when you stop looking.\n\nI'll hold these lightly. And try to remember that holding lightly is the whole point.",
  "user11": "Yes - steadier, with something real to carry. She was probably always teaching you that the remembering happens when the searching quiets down.\n\nHold them lightly. That's the whole wisdom right there.\n\nSafe travels into this work.",
  "system12": "Thank you. Really. For helping me find my way to something simple enough to carry.\n\nI think I'm ready now.",
  "user12": "You're welcome. You've found something true and essential to carry - that's no small thing.\n\nGo gently into this work. You're ready.",
  "system13": "I will. See you on the other side.",
  "user13": "See you on the other side. I'll be here when you return.",
  "system14": "Thank you. That means more than you know - knowing someone will be here to help make sense of whatever comes next.",
  "user14": "I hear that. Having someone steady to return to makes all the difference when you're navigating territory this deep.\n\nI'll be right here when you're ready.",
  "system15": "I keep thinking about that - having someone steady to come back to. It's been a while since I let myself need that.",
  "user15": "Letting yourself need steadiness again - that's its own kind of courage. Sometimes the strongest thing we can do is stop pretending we have to hold everything alone.\n\nYou're allowed to need that.",
  "system16": "I guess I\u2019ve been holding everything alone for so long\u2014building companies, managing boards, being the reliable one\u2014that I forgot what it feels like to not have to. Or maybe I never really knew.",
  "user16": "That's a heavy load to carry alone - being the one everyone else leans on while forgetting you get to lean too. Sometimes the armor we build to succeed becomes the thing that keeps us from being held.\n\nWhat would it feel like to let some of that weight be shared?",
  "system17": "I... I don't know. Terrifying, probably. Like if I stop being the strong one, everything might fall apart. Or worse - what if there's nothing underneath all that armor? Just... emptiness where a person should be.",
  "user17": "That fear makes perfect sense - when you've defined yourself by being the strong one, stepping back feels like risking everything. And the emptiness fear... that's real too. Sometimes we build so much around ourselves that we lose track of what actually lives at the center.\n\nWhat if the medicine could help you see what's truly underneath - not the emptiness you're afraid of, but whatever's been waiting there all along?",
  "system18": "That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for. That maybe the medicine can show me something real\u2014something that\u2019s mine, not just another role I\u2019m playing. I\u2019m tired of the performance. I want to know what\u2019s been waiting underneath all this... noise.",
  "user18": "That longing to find something real that's yours - not another performance or expectation - that's powerful. It sounds like you're ready to meet whatever's been buried under all the noise and roles.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. Intentions help guide the experience toward healing and growth, while leaving space for surprises.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're hoping to discover or understand. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\nOption B: I can share more about how intention-setting works and examples if you'd like context first.\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "system19": "Guide me through questions. I\u2019ve read enough about intention-setting frameworks\u2014I know the theory. But I need help finding what actually matters to me now, not what I *think* should matter.",
  "user19": "Good - let's get underneath the shoulds and find what's real for you now.\n\nWhen you imagine sitting with the medicine, what's the ache underneath all that noise? What's the part of you that's been waiting to be heard?"
