  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I guess I'm hoping it'll help me figure out what's next. I've built and sold companies, sat on boards, done all the right things. But lately I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this way of being present that I don't have. I want that. I want to stop feeling like I'm performing my life instead of living it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop performing life and start living it\n2. Find your grandmother's quiet presence and faith\n3. Figure out what's actually next beyond achievements\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those feel right. It's like I've been following this map that everyone said would lead somewhere meaningful, but I've been checking boxes instead of actually being anywhere. And I keep thinking about how my grandmother would just... sit. No phone, no to-do list, just sit with people and really be there. I don't know how to do that anymore.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live my life instead of performing it\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet presence\n3. I discover what actually matters beyond achievements\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I live my life instead of performing it\" - that's the one that hits hardest. Though I wonder if it's too... I don't know, dramatic? But it's true. I catch myself even with my kids sometimes, thinking about how I should be reacting instead of just reacting. \n\nThe grandmother one feels important too, but I'm not sure I know how to put that into words yet. And the achievements thing... it's like I know that ladder doesn't go anywhere real, but I don't know what to climb instead.",
  "system3": "Keep the first one - \"I live my life instead of performing it\" captures exactly what you described.\n\nFor your grandmother's presence, try: \"I reclaim my grandmother's way of being fully present\"\n\nAnd for achievements: \"I discover what matters beyond the next milestone\"\n\nHow do these three feel together?",
  "user3": "They're good... they feel right. But honestly? I'm scared that even if I set these intentions, I'll find a way to turn them into another performance. Another thing to achieve. Like I'll be sitting there during the ceremony thinking \"am I living authentically NOW? How about NOW?\" instead of just... being.\n\nGod, even my fears about this are performative. My grandmother would probably just laugh and tell me to stop thinking so much.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I live my life instead of performing it\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's way of being fully present\n3. I discover what matters beyond the next milestone\n\nKeep them somewhere you'll see them daily - wallet, journal, wherever.\n\nThese are your compass. The medicine will work with what you've set, even when your mind tries to turn it into another performance.\n\nTrust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll... I'll keep them close. Maybe I'll write them in the journal I used to carry to board meetings - the one with the coffee stains and all my old quarterly goals. Seems right to give those pages something real to hold onto.\n\nI just realized - my grandmother never wrote intentions. She just lived them. Maybe that's what I'm really learning here.",
  "system5": "That's it exactly - she lived them without needing to write them down.\n\nThe intentions will meet you where you are, even when you're overthinking in ceremony. The medicine knows how to work with what you've set.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user5": "Yeah... yeah, I think I get that now. She didn't need to write \"be present\" because she just was. Every moment. Even when she was sick at the end, she'd just hold my hand and look at me like I was the only thing that mattered in that moment.\n\nMaybe that's what I'm really after - not just to stop performing, but to actually matter to someone the way she made people feel like they mattered. Including myself.",
  "system6": "She gave people the gift of being seen - and you're learning to give that to yourself now.\n\nThe intentions you set will carry that same quality. Trust them to guide you there.",
  "user6": "I want to believe that. That I can learn to see myself the way she saw me - not for what I could achieve or build or sell, but just... Ellen. The girl who used to pick dandelions and make up stories about where the birds were flying off to.\n\nI think that's what scared me most after I sold the company. Looking in the mirror and not knowing who I was without the next thing to chase. But maybe that's exactly where I need to be.",
  "system7": "That's the place - where you don't know who you are without the chase. That's exactly where the medicine can show you something real.\n\nYour intentions will meet you there, in that not-knowing space. Trust what comes up when you don't have the next milestone to reach for.",
  "user7": "It's terrifying, honestly. That space of not-knowing. My whole life has been about knowing - what grade I needed, what deal to close, what market to enter. Even these past five years of searching, I was still chasing something... enlightenment, meaning, purpose. Always something.\n\nBut you're right. Maybe for once I can just stop running and see what's actually here. See who's actually here.",
  "system8": "Exactly - just stop and see what's actually here. \n\nThe medicine will work with that space. Your intentions are set to guide you into it, not around it.\n\nTrust what you find when you're not running toward something.",
  "user8": "Okay. I will. I'm... I'm ready to stop running. Even if it scares the hell out of me.\n\nThank you for helping me find the words for what I couldn't quite name.",
  "system9": "Good. Trust what you find in the stillness.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user9": "I am. See you on the other side.",
  "system10": "See you there.",
  "user10": "Ellen, it's been a few months since your Ibogaine journey. How are you?",
  "system11": "Been a while. How are you holding up after the journey?",
  "user11": "It's... different than I expected. \n\nI found something in that stillness, alright. But it's not what I thought I was looking for. Turns out when you strip away all the chasing, what's left isn't some grand spiritual revelation\u2014it's just... me. A middle-aged woman who spent twenty years running from her grandmother's faith and her own softness.\n\nThe medicine showed me that the next chapter isn't about building something new. It's about going home to what I abandoned. My grandmother's Jewish mysticism, my father's quiet reverence for nature... they were never separate from success. I made them separate.\n\nI sold my board seats last month. All of them. And I'm working with a few other women from the underground group to create something... well, we're still figuring out what it is. Something that bridges ancient wisdom and modern leadership without the usual spiritual bypassing bullshit.\n\nThe kids notice I'm different. Present, I guess. My husband still doesn't fully get it, but he's watching me slow down and actually breathe. And for once, I'm not trying to optimize his understanding of my experience.\n\nI still wake up at 5:30. But sometimes I just... sit there. No meditation app. No productivity hack. Just me and my breath and the realization that I spent forty-five years trying to earn my worth instead of remembering I already had it.",
  "system12": "You found the real thing - not another thing to chase, just what's been here all along.\n\nSounds like you're building something that actually makes sense now. Not because you need to prove anything, but because it's time to bring those pieces back together.\n\nThe sitting without optimizing - that's where the medicine keeps working.",
  "user12": "Yeah. It's... quieter than I thought it would be. Not the dramatic transformation I kept expecting from each retreat. More like watching ice melt - slow, inevitable, and somehow exactly what needs to happen.\n\nThe other women and I... we're calling it \"The Sabbath Project\" for now. Taking the radical idea that rest isn't earned, it's required. That you can build companies and still light candles on Friday night without either being performative. We're starting with ten female founders, all successful, all exhausted, all secretly wondering if their grandmother knew something they didn't.\n\nI keep hearing the medicine's voice when I want to rush: \"What's the hurry, Ellen? Where exactly are you trying to get to that you aren't already?\"\n\nMy daughter asked me last week why I smile more when I'm washing dishes. I told her it's because I'm finally learning that saving the world might look like being completely present while scrubbing a pot. She rolled her eyes - she's twelve - but I caught her trying it later.\n\nThe integration isn't perfect. I still check email too much. I still have mornings where the old panic creeps in, whispering that I'm falling behind some invisible metric. But now I know that voice isn't truth - it's just habit. And habits can change.\n\nMy grandmother would probably just say, \"Welcome home, bubbeleh. Took you long enough.\"",
  "system13": "Sounds like you're finally living what the medicine showed you - not just understanding it.\n\nThe Sabbath Project makes sense. Ten exhausted women remembering rest isn't earned, it's required. Your grandmother would probably smile at that.\n\nThe panic voice losing its grip - that's the real integration. Not that it disappears, but you know it for what it is now.\n\nKeep scrubbing those pots.",
  "user13": "Keep scrubbing those pots. \n\nI will. And I'll keep remembering that when my hands are in warm water, my grandmother's hands are there too. Four generations of women who knew that feeding people was prayer, that rest was resistance, that the most radical thing you can do in a world obsessed with more is to simply... stop.\n\nThe medicine didn't give me answers. It gave me back my inheritance.",
  "system14": "Exactly.",
  "user14": "Funny how the most profound realizations sound so simple when you say them out loud. But living them... that's where the real work lives.",
  "system15": "Simple doesn't mean easy. Living it is where most people turn back.",
  "user15": "Yeah. I've been watching that in myself - this weird pull to complicate things again. Like if I'm not struggling or striving, I must be doing it wrong. \n\nLast week I caught myself researching \"advanced integration practices\" at 2am. Had to laugh. The medicine shows me that presence is enough, and my first instinct is to turn that into another achievement project.\n\nMy grandmother never needed a book to tell her how to be human. She just... was.",
  "system16": "The mind wants to optimize even presence. Can't just be - has to be \"advanced being.\"\n\nYour grandmother knew the secret: just show up and wash the pot.",
  "user16": "Exactly. She'd probably look at all my books and apps and retreats and just shake her head. \"You needed all this to learn what I could have told you over coffee?\"\n\nBut maybe that's the point. Maybe I needed to go so far out to finally find my way back in. The long way home.",
  "system17": "Sometimes the long way is the only way that works. Your grandmother probably knew that too.",
  "user17": "She did. She used to say, \"Some people need to touch every fence post to know they're home.\" I thought she was talking about my cousin who moved to seventeen different cities. Now I think she was talking about all of us who have to build companies and scale businesses and chase every achievement before we can finally sit still long enough to hear what our hands already know when they're washing a pot.\n\nThe long way isn't wrong. It's just... long.",
  "system18": "She knew you'd touch every fence post. Knew you'd need to prove you could build something big before you'd believe small things matter.\n\nThe long way got you here. That's what counts.",
  "user18": "Yeah. She always saw the end from the beginning, didn't she? While I was busy proving I could build something that mattered to everyone else, she was waiting for me to figure out that mattering isn't something you achieve.\n\nI keep thinking about that last conversation before she died. I was telling her about this huge deal I was closing, and she just smiled and said, \"That's nice, bubeleh. But when are you coming to make soup with me?\" \n\nI was so annoyed. Thought she didn't understand what I was building. Now I think she understood exactly. She was just waiting for me to finish building it so I could finally come home and chop carrots.",
  "system19": "She wasn't waiting for you to finish building. She was waiting for you to finish proving. Knew you'd circle back when you were ready to chop instead of conquer.\n\nThe soup was always the point.",
  "user19": "God, that's it, isn't it? She wasn't waiting for me to finish anything. She was just... being. Making soup. Lighting candles. Saying prayers over ordinary things while I was out there trying to make myself extraordinary.\n\nI thought I had to earn my way back to the table. She knew I just had to stop running and sit down.\n\nThe soup was always the point. The prayers were always the answer."
