  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for Ibogaine. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me pieces of what I'm searching for, but I can't seem to hold onto it. I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want that, but I don't know how to get there from here.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Hold onto the insights instead of losing them\n2. Find your grandmother's quiet faith that carried her through\n3. Bridge the gap between knowing and being\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I like how you put that - \"bridge the gap between knowing and being.\" That's exactly it. I've collected all these insights, but they're like... souvenirs from trips. They sit on a shelf. I want them to live in me the way my grandmother's faith lived in her.\n\nI guess the first intention would be about actually integrating what I learn this time. Not just having another profound experience that fades.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I integrate what the medicine shows me so it lives in me\n2. I discover my own quiet faith that carries me through\n3. I close the gap between knowing and being\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user2": "The first one hits - \"integrate what the medicine shows me so it lives in me.\" That feels right. Like maybe I don't need to hold on so tight if I'm actually living it instead.\n\nThe second one... I don't know. \"Quiet faith\" was my grandmother's, not necessarily mine. Maybe I'm supposed to discover something different? Something that's actually mine?\n\nAnd the third one - \"close the gap between knowing and being\" - that might be the heart of it. I keep thinking if I just know enough, understand enough, it'll finally click into place.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I integrate what the medicine shows me so it lives in me\n2. I discover the steady faith that's actually mine\n3. I close the gap between knowing and being\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, these feel like they're mine. Not someone else's version of what I should be seeking. \"The steady faith that's actually mine\" - that lands differently. Like maybe I don't have to replicate my grandmother's path, just find whatever's authentic to me.\n\nI keep thinking about how I approach everything like a business problem - analyze, strategize, optimize. But this isn't working like that. I can't just check boxes until I arrive at spiritual fulfillment.\n\nThese intentions... they feel like they could actually guide me somewhere real this time.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I integrate what the medicine shows me so it lives in me\n2. I discover the steady faith that's actually mine  \n3. I close the gap between knowing and being\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll keep them close. Maybe write them on the same card I use for my morning coffee budget tracking - I look at that every day without fail. \n\nThank you. I feel... steadier about this. Like I have something real to hold onto going into this journey.",
  "system5": "Good. That card will serve you well.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I will. And maybe this time I won't come back trying to immediately optimize whatever insights I get. Maybe I'll just... let them unfold.",
  "system6": "That's the shift right there.",
  "user6": "Yeah... that's the shift.",
  "system7": "Exactly. You're ready.",
  "user7": "Thank you. I needed this - the clarity, the steadiness. See you on the other side.",
  "system8": "Solid compass. Trust the journey.",
  "user8": "I will. Finally feel like I have a compass that points true north - not someone else's version of it.",
  "system9": "That's all yours. Let it guide you.",
  "user9": "*keeps card in wallet*",
  "system10": "*keeps card in wallet*",
  "user10": "It's staying there. Next to the kids' school photos and that fortune cookie I got years ago that said \"You will travel far.\" Funny how everything's connected.",
  "system11": "The medicine will work with what you've set.",
  "user11": "That\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on. I\u2019ve done the prep\u2014now I just need to let go and trust the process.",
  "system12": "Exactly. You've done the work. Now let the work do you.",
  "user12": "Let the work do me... I like that. Never thought of it that way\u2014always been the one driving. Time to hand over the wheel.",
  "system13": "Sit back. See where it takes you.",
  "user13": "Yeah. First time in years I\u2019m not trying to steer. Just... see what shows up.",
  "system14": "That's when the real direction appears.",
  "user14": "I hope so. 'Cause every map I've drawn so far just led back to the same empty room.",
  "system15": "Different terrain ahead. Trust the compass.",
  "user15": "I\u2019ll try. Hard habit to break\u2014always checking the dial, always recalculating. But I hear you.",
  "system16": "Drop the compass checking. Let the needle do its job.",
  "user16": "...I don't know how to not look. Even when I'm staring at stars I'm still counting them, making sure none go missing.",
  "system17": "Counting stars keeps you from seeing the sky. Try sitting with just one star tonight. No tally. Just look.",
  "user17": "One star. No math. Just... let it hang there. Okay. I\u2019ll pick the small one over the oak, the one that blinks like it\u2019s trying to tell me something.",
  "system18": "Let it blink. Don't decode. Just watch.",
  "user18": "Yeah. No spreadsheet for starlight. I\u2019ll try.",
  "system19": "Good. When you catch yourself counting, gently bring it back to that single blinking star.",
  "user19": "I\u2019ll catch myself\u2014automatic pilot, boardroom habit. One star, no ROI."
