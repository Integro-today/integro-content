  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help me sleep better. That's it. Amanda's worried about me, says I wake up shouting sometimes. I don't... I don't need to make this into some big spiritual thing. Just want to be able to close my eyes without seeing the damn explosions every night.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without seeing explosions\n2. Stop waking up shouting\n3. Amanda stops worrying\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that's... that's about right. I guess the shouting thing's gotten worse. Amanda moved to the guest room last week. Said she needs sleep too. \n\nI just want to be able to lie down next to my wife and not ruin her night too. Is that too much to ask after fifteen years of marriage?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim my place beside Amanda \n3. I release the explosions into rest\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "*I reclaim my place beside Amanda.* \n\nThat's... that's what I want. The other stuff's just noise. Fifteen years I've been her husband, and now she's sleeping down the hall because she's scared of what I might do in the dark. I need to get back to her. I need to be the man she married, not... whatever this is.\n\nThe explosions can go to hell for all I care. Just let me back in that bed.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim my place beside Amanda\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "*I sleep peacefully through the night* - sounds too... soft. Like something off a meditation app. But I guess that's what I need, isn't it? Just to close my eyes without my heart trying to punch through my chest.\n\n*I release the explosions into rest* - I don't even know what that means. Release how? Like I'm supposed to just... let go of watching Henderson's bird go down in flames? Of hearing Rodriguez call for medevac that never came? \n\nI need the sleep one. Don't know about the release part.",
  "system4": "How about: \"I sleep without the explosions\"\n\nSimple. Direct. No soft language.",
  "user4": "Yeah. That works. \n\n*I sleep without the explosions.*\n\nPlain. Like it should be. Like it was before I went over there and brought pieces of it home with me.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep without the explosions\n\nHow about intention 3 - what do you want instead of trying to release what happened?",
  "user5": "I want to stop feeling like I'm about to crawl out of my own skin all the time. Like there's this pressure building up and the only way to let it out is to snap at Amanda or the kids when they don't deserve it.\n\nI want to be able to sit still without feeling like I need to get up and check something, fix something, do something. Just... be okay in my own damn body for once.",
  "system6": "How about: \"I feel steady in my own skin\"\n\nOr: \"I sit still without the pressure building\"\n\nWhich feels more like what you want?",
  "user6": "*I feel steady in my own skin.*\n\nThat's it. That's what I want. To not feel like I'm about to jump out of myself every time someone drops a pan in the kitchen or a car backfires three blocks over. To just... be a person again. Not this coiled-up thing waiting to explode.\n\nYeah. Steady. I want to feel steady.",
  "system7": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep without the explosions\n2. I reclaim my place beside Amanda\n3. I feel steady in my own skin\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user7": "Thanks. I'll write these down. Keep 'em close.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll see if this plant medicine stuff is worth anything, or if I'm just another broken vet chasing shadows.",
  "system8": "Three weeks. You've got solid intentions to work with.\n\nThe medicine will meet you where you are.",
  "user8": "I'm counting on that. Counting on something, anyway.\n\nTell me straight - when I'm in there, when it hits... what if I can't handle what comes up? What if I see Henderson's face again and lose it completely?",
  "system9": "You'll see Henderson. Count on it.\n\nThe medicine shows you what needs showing. Your job isn't to handle it perfectly - it's to stay breathing and trust the process.\n\nThe facilitators know how to hold space for warriors losing it. You're not their first combat vet.",
  "user9": "Right. Stay breathing. I can do that. Done it through worse.\n\nJust... hate the idea of someone seeing me come apart like that. Like some damn recruit who can't keep his shit together.\n\nBut if Henderson shows up, maybe I finally tell him I'm sorry. Maybe that's what this is about.",
  "system10": "Could be. Or maybe you finally let him tell you something.\n\nEither way, the coming apart is part of the putting back together.",
  "user10": "Yeah. Maybe that's what I'm most afraid of - finding out what he might say if I actually listen.\n\nBeen carrying his voice in my head for fifteen years. Maybe it's time to hear what the hell he wants.",
  "system11": "Fifteen years is a long conversation with a ghost.\n\nTime to let him speak his piece.",
  "user11": "Time to stop being such a damn coward about it, anyway.\n\nFifteen years of him showing up in my dreams and me just... shutting him down. Running. Waking up screaming before he can say whatever he's trying to say.\n\nMaybe this is where it ends.",
  "system12": "Not a coward. You survived.\n\nBut yeah - maybe this is where surviving turns into something else.",
  "user12": "Into what? Not sure I even know what that looks like anymore.\n\nAll I know is surviving. It's what I'm good at.",
  "system13": "Into whatever comes after just getting through the day.\n\nYou won't know until you get there.",
  "user13": "Just getting through the day... yeah, that's about all I've got left in me lately.\n\nMaybe that's enough to start with. Getting through one more day, but this time with my eyes open for once.",
  "system14": "That's enough.\n\nSometimes the bravest thing is just keeping your eyes open.",
  "user14": "Keeping my eyes open... that's what scares the hell out of me.\n\nBut I hear you. One more day. Eyes open. Breathing.\n\nI can do that.",
  "system15": "Good. Keep it simple.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user15": "Amanda. Plain and simple.\n\nShe said she's tired of sleeping next to a ghost. Told me I either do something or she's taking the kids to her sister's place.\n\nHeroic Hearts called it my last shot. Maybe they're right.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop being a ghost beside Amanda\n2. Stop running from whatever's chasing you in dreams  \n3. Stay present for your kids before they lose their father too\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yeah... those three about sum it up.\n\nI want to be a man worth sleeping next to again. Not this... whatever I've become.\n\nWant to face whatever's in those dreams without waking up ready to fight or run.\n\nAnd I need to be someone my kids can actually know. Not just the guy who drives them places and fixes things when they break.\n\nHow do I even say that without sounding like some damn therapy commercial?",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up as a man Amanda wants beside her\n2. I face what's in my dreams without running\n3. I let my kids actually know who I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "Number two. That's the one that scares me most, so that's probably where I need to go.\n\nBut \"face what's in my dreams\" sounds too... soft. Like I'm some kid scared of the dark.\n\nHow about: \"I stop running from the war that follows me home every night.\"\n\nThat's more honest.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I stop running from the war that follows me home every night*\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user18": "Number one... \"I show up as a man Amanda wants beside her\" - that feels right. It's on me to become that man, not on her to accept whatever I've been.\n\nNumber three though... \"I let my kids actually know who I am\" - I don't even know who I am anymore. How can they know me when I'm a stranger to myself?\n\nMaybe that's the whole damn point.",
  "system19": "That's the whole damn point.\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I show up as a man Amanda wants beside her*\n\nHow about intention 3: *I discover who I am so my kids can know him too*\n\nThat work?",
  "user19": "Yeah... that works.\n\nI can't keep hiding behind this version of me that just gets through the day. Maybe it's time to figure out who's actually still in here.\n\nLet's do it."
