  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts accepted me into their program. Three weeks from now I'm going to Costa Rica for this ayahuasca thing. \n\nAmanda\u2014my wife\u2014she says I need to do something. I wake up shouting most nights, scaring the kids. Haven't had a full night's sleep in months. She thinks this plant medicine might help.\n\nI don't buy into all that stuff. But I can't lose her. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Stop scaring the kids \n3. Keep Amanda from leaving\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I guess that about covers it. \n\nI just want to sleep without the dreams coming. Wake up quiet, not shouting like some damn... like I used to when we got mortared. \n\nAnd yeah, the kids shouldn't have to see their dad like that. My boy asked me last week if I was okay when I woke up. Eleven years old shouldn't be worried about his old man.\n\nAmanda says she doesn't know me anymore. Been married eighteen years. I don't want to lose what we built together.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I show my kids their dad is okay\n3. I reclaim connection with Amanda\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "*Reclaim connection with Amanda.* \n\nThat's the one. The others matter but... that's what I can't lose. Everything else falls apart if she goes.\n\nLanguage feels a little soft though. \"Reclaim connection\" - I don't know. Sounds like some therapy crap. \n\nWhat's something stronger? More direct? Like... *I keep my marriage strong.* Or *I stay the husband Amanda deserves.* Something like that.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I stay the man Amanda married\"\n\nKeeps it direct. Holds you to showing up as yourself, not the stranger she's seeing now.",
  "user3": "Yeah. \n\n*I stay the man Amanda married.*\n\nThat's good. Direct. Not flowery. Just... be who I'm supposed to be.\n\nShe used to say I made her feel safe. Now she checks on me in the middle of the night, makes sure I'm not having another episode. That's not how it's supposed to work.\n\nI want to be the one who takes care of her. Like before.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I stay the man Amanda married\n\nHow do the other two land?\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I show my kids their dad is okay",
  "user4": "They're fine. \n\nThe sleep one... I don't know. \"Peacefully\" sounds like I'm trying to force it to be nice and calm. Sometimes I just need it to not be hell. Maybe *I sleep through the night without the dreams coming.* More honest.\n\nThe kids one works. *I show my kids their dad is okay.* Yeah. That's what matters. My daughter\u2014she's fourteen now\u2014she used to think I could fix anything. Now she looks at me like I'm broken.\n\nI hate that look.",
  "system5": "Got it.\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams coming\n2. I stay the man Amanda married  \n3. I show my kids their dad is okay\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Yeah. I'll keep them close.\n\nAppreciate it. This whole thing still feels... I don't know. But at least I know what I'm aiming for now.\n\nThree weeks. Then I find out if this plant medicine stuff actually works.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is enough time to get familiar with these intentions. Read them daily - let them settle in.\n\nThe medicine works whether you believe in it or not. Just show up with what's real.",
  "user6": "*Show up with what's real.*\n\nThat's what I do. Always have.\n\nGuess we'll see what happens when I can't just muscle through it anymore.",
  "system7": "Exactly. When muscling through stops working, something else has to take over.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "Something else, huh?\n\nBeen muscling through since Afghanistan. It's all I know.\n\nBut you're right - it's not working anymore. Maybe time to find out what the hell's underneath all that steel.",
  "system8": "Underneath the steel is still you. Just a version that doesn't have to carry everything alone.\n\nThe medicine will show you what you're ready to see.",
  "user8": "*A version that doesn't have to carry everything alone.*\n\nThat... that might be worth seeing.",
  "system9": "It is.",
  "user9": "Then let's do this.",
  "system10": "You're ready.",
  "user10": "Yeah. I am.",
  "system11": "Good. Keep those intentions close. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user11": "Copy that.",
  "system12": "Solid copy.",
  "user12": "Solid copy.",
  "system13": "You\u2019re holding it. Let the rest come.",
  "user13": "Holding it.",
  "system14": "That's the work.",
  "user14": "Roger that.",
  "system15": "You\u2019re locked in.",
  "user15": "Locked and loaded.",
  "system16": "Good. Now let the medicine do its job.",
  "user16": "Copy.",
  "system17": "You\u2019re set.",
  "user17": "Set.",
  "system18": "Solid.",
  "user18": "Solid.",
  "system19": "Carry on.",
