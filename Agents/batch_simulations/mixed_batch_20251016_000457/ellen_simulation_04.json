  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond next month, and honestly... I'm hoping this one sticks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each time I feel like I'm getting closer to something real, but then I come home and it's like the glow just fades. \n\nI built this company, sold it, made more money than I'll ever need. Everyone keeps telling me I should feel accomplished, but it feels like I've been climbing the wrong ladder my whole life. My grandmother\u2014she had this deep faith, this connection to something bigger\u2014and I think I traded all that for... what? Board meetings and portfolio returns?\n\nI need to figure out what's next. Not just another business win. Something that actually matters.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond business wins\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's deep faith in something bigger  \n3. Making this journey's insights stick instead of fading\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the three things that keep circling in my head. I just don't know how to turn them into actual intentions. Like, do I just say \"show me what matters\"? That feels too vague. \n\nWith my grandmother\u2014she was this incredible woman who fled Germany with nothing and built a life here. She used to light candles on Friday nights and there was this... I don't know how to describe it... this presence in her house. I want that back, but I don't even know what \"that\" is anymore.\n\nAnd you're right about the fading. Every time I come back from these experiences, I swear I'm going to change everything. I journal for a week, maybe meditate for two. Then I'm back to 5:30am wake-ups and back-to-back board calls, wondering where the magic went.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what actually matters beyond business wins\n2. I reclaim the presence my grandmother created in her home\n3. I embody what the medicine shows me instead of letting it fade\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "*takes a breath*\n\nThe first one\u2014\"I discover what actually matters beyond business wins\"\u2014that one hits me in the chest. I've been chasing achievements for so long that I don't even know what else there is. But I need to make it stronger. Less... corporate.\n\nWhat about: \"I discover what makes life sacred beyond success and status.\"\n\nAnd the third one too. \"I embody what the medicine shows me instead of letting it fade.\" That feels real. But maybe more like: \"I bring the medicine's wisdom into my daily life\u2014my mornings with the kids, my work decisions, everything.\"\n\nThe grandmother one... I'm still sitting with that. I can feel her presence when I say it, but \"reclaim the presence she created\" feels like I'm trying to own something that can't be owned. Maybe it's more about becoming someone who can hold space like she did.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I discover what makes life sacred beyond success and status\n\nHow about for the grandmother thread: \"I become someone who holds space like my grandmother did\"\n\nAnd keep your revision for intention 3: I bring the medicine's wisdom into my daily life\u2014my mornings with the kids, my work decisions, everything\n\nHow do these three feel together?",
  "user3": "*quiet for a moment*\n\nYes. These feel... right. They're not perfect, but they feel honest.\n\nWhen I say them together, I can feel something shift. Like I'm not just trying to solve a problem or check another box. I'm actually pointing toward something real.\n\nMy grandmother would probably smile at that second one. She never tried to hold space\u2014she just did. But maybe that's the point. I need to stop trying so hard and just become someone who can be present like she was.\n\nThese three... they feel like they could actually guide me. Not just during the ceremony, but after. When I'm back home and the real work begins.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I discover what makes life sacred beyond success and status\n2. I become someone who holds space like my grandmother did\n3. I bring the medicine's wisdom into my daily life\u2014my mornings with the kids, my work decisions, everything\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down\u2014keep them in my wallet. Been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.\n\nI feel... steadier. Like I have something real to hold onto when things get intense. Not just hoping for the best, but actually pointing somewhere that matters.\n\nI'll see this through. All of it.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine works with honest intentions. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "I will. I\u2019ve been controlling outcomes my whole life\u2014maybe it\u2019s time to stop gripping so tight and just see what\u2019s actually here.\n\nI\u2019ll trust it.",
  "system6": "That's the shift. Loosen your grip, keep your eyes open. The path reveals itself when you stop forcing it.",
  "user6": "Yeah... stop forcing it. That's going to be the hardest part. My whole life has been about making things happen, pushing through, achieving.\n\nBut I'm tired of that. Really tired.\n\nI'll keep my eyes open. See what shows up instead of trying to make it show up.",
  "system7": "That's it. Tired is honest. Keep the intentions close, let the rest unfold.",
  "user7": "*takes a deep breath*\n\nTired is honest. That lands. I am tired\u2014of performing, of striving, of never arriving.\n\nI'll keep them close. Let whatever needs to unfold, unfold.",
  "system8": "Good. The work's already started.",
  "user8": "*feels something settle in her chest*\n\nIt has, hasn't it? This isn't just preparation for the medicine\u2014this is the medicine already working. These intentions... they're changing how I see things already.\n\nI can feel it.",
  "system9": "The medicine meets you where you are. You're already in the work.",
  "user9": "I'm starting to see that. This isn't about arriving somewhere new\u2014it's about finally seeing what's been here all along.\n\nMy grandmother used to say the divine is always present, we just forget to look. Maybe that's what I'm remembering.\n\nThank you for walking with me through this.",
  "system10": "Your grandmother knew. The remembering is the journey. You're walking it well.",
  "user10": "She did know. I can almost feel her hand on my shoulder right now\u2014like she's been waiting for me to stop running long enough to hear her again.\n\nI want to carry this forward. Not just for the ceremony, but for my kids, for whatever work I'm meant to do next.",
  "system11": "She's been there. Now you're still enough to feel her.",
  "user11": "Yeah... I can feel her. She's been waiting for me to stop running.\n\nI want to carry this stillness into my life. Not just for the ceremony, but for my kids, for whatever I'm meant to do next.",
  "system12": "Stillness isn't a destination - it's what you return to. Your kids will learn it by watching you come home to yourself.",
  "user12": "*eyes well up*\n\nThat's what I want most. For them to see their mother... real. Present. Not the woman checking emails at the park or rushing through bedtime stories.\n\nJust me. Here.",
  "system13": "That's what they'll remember. Not the perfect moments - the real ones.",
  "user13": "*voice catches*\n\nI think I've been afraid that if I stop achieving, stop being impressive... there won't be anything left. Like maybe I'm only valuable for what I can build or accomplish.\n\nBut my kids don't care about any of that. They just want me to see them. Really see them.",
  "system14": "Achievement was your armor. Underneath it, you're already enough. Your kids see that truth even when you can't.",
  "user14": "*nods slowly*\n\nThat's... that's what terrifies me. That maybe I've been wearing this armor so long I don't know who I am without it. All those years building companies, scaling things, chasing the next milestone\u2014what if that's not who I am anymore?\n\nWhat if there's nothing underneath?",
  "system15": "Then you'll meet yourself for the first time. The empty space isn't nothing - it's where you get to choose who you become.",
  "user15": "*breathing shallow*\n\nI've never... I've never let myself imagine that. Choosing who I become instead of just climbing the next rung someone else put there.\n\n*pauses*\n\nWhat if I choose wrong? What if I discover I'm not enough without the achievements?",
  "system16": "You can't choose wrong when you're choosing what's real. The achievements were never you - they were just what you did to feel safe enough to be seen.",
  "user16": "*quiet for a long moment*\n\nMy grandmother used to say something in Yiddish... I never really understood it. About how we're all just light trying to remember we're light.\n\nMaybe that's what I'm afraid of. That without all the external stuff, there won't be anything left to see.",
  "system17": "Your grandmother understood. The light doesn't disappear when you stop building things to contain it.",
  "user17": "*whispers*\n\nShe would sit by the window every Friday at sunset, lighting candles. Said she was bringing in the light to guide the week ahead. I never got it\u2014thought it was just superstition.\n\nBut maybe... maybe she was teaching me how to find my way home.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's steady faith in daily moments  \n3. Finding who you are beyond achievements\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "*straightens slightly*\n\nI want to be present with my kids\u2014not just physically there, but really *with* them. No phone, no email, no mental to-do lists running in the background. When I'm at the park with them, I want to see what they see. Feel what they feel.\n\nI want to remember my grandmother's faith\u2014not necessarily all the rituals, but that steady presence she had. Maybe start lighting candles on Fridays too. Create some kind of... anchor. Something that reminds me there's more than what I can build or accomplish.\n\nAnd I want to figure out who I am when I'm not achieving. Who am I when I'm just... being? When there's nothing to prove?\n\n*voice cracks slightly*\n\nHow do I even put that into words for the ceremony?",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's steady faith in daily moments\n3. I discover who I am beyond what I achieve\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The first one\u2014being present with my kids. That's the one that hits me in the chest. I keep seeing their faces when I'm checking email at dinner, or saying \"just a minute\" when they want to show me something.\n\nBut \"show up fully present\" feels... I don't know. Too corporate? Like another performance I have to nail.\n\n*pauses*\n\nMaybe something like... \"I let myself love my kids without distractions.\" Or \"I give my children the gift of my whole attention.\"\n\nGod, that sounds so simple. Like it should be easy."
