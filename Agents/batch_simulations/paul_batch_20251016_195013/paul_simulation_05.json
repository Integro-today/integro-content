  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I dont know. Just want to stop waking Amanda up at night. \n\nAnd... maybe not snap at the kids so much.",
  "system1": "Two threads:\n\n1. Sleep peacefully through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Respond to my kids with patience instead of snapping\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those sound right. \n\nJust want to be able to sleep without... you know. Waking up shouting. And be able to sit through dinner without Michael flinching when I speak.\n\nThats it really.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without shouting\n2. I speak gently so Michael doesn't flinch at dinner\n3. I create calm instead of chaos in my home\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "First one. The sleep thing. \n\nBut... I dont know about \"peacefully.\" Sounds like some yoga retreat. Just want to sleep without shouting. Without waking her up.\n\nSecond one hits too. But \"speak gently\" makes me sound like some... I dont know. Just want Michael to not look scared when I talk.\n\nThird ones too much. I dont need to create anything. Just want the noise in my head to quiet down enough so theyre not walking on eggshells.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without shouting\n2. I speak so Michael doesn't look scared\n3. I quiet the noise that makes them walk on eggshells\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "Yeah. Those work.\n\nEspecially the first one. If I could just... sleep. Without the cockpit alarms going off in my head. Without Amanda having to shake me awake while Im shouting about things she doesnt understand.\n\nThe other two... I mean theyre right. Just dont know if some plant medicine can actually do that. But yeah. Those are what I want.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without shouting\n2. I speak so Michael doesn't look scared  \n3. I quiet the noise that makes them walk on eggshells\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. Thanks.\n\nJust... dont expect miracles okay. Im doing this because I said I would. For Amanda. \n\nBut yeah. Got it. Three things. Sleep. Michael not looking at me like Im a bomb about to go off. Maybe some quiet in my head for once.\n\nWe'll see what happens.",
  "system5": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Just show up - that's enough.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Showing up. Thats one thing I know how to do.\n\nBeen doing it my whole life.",
  "system6": "That's your foundation. Trust it.",
  "user6": "yeah. alright.",

  "system13": "Yeah. Different kind of silence.\n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind for this journey?",
  "user13": "idk. just want the nightmares to stop. amanda says i wake her up yelling. guess thats why im doing this.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Let Amanda rest peacefully beside me\n3. Find what the yelling is trying to release\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "look i dont need fancy words. just want to sleep. and not scare my wife. thats it.",
  "system15": "Got it. Based on that:\n\n1. I sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me\n3. I quiet what's making me yell\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user15": "third ones too vague. just say i stop yelling in my sleep. thats what i want.",
