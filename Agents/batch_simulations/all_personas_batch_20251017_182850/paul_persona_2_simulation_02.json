  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts accepted me into their program. Three weeks in Costa Rica. Said this plant medicine... ayahuasca... might help with what I'm dealing with.\n\nI don't know about all that spiritual stuff, but Amanda\u2014my wife\u2014she's at her wit's end. Says I wake up screaming, that I'm angry all the time. I guess I am. I just... I need to sleep. Need to stop snapping at her for nothing. \n\nTwenty years I've been back, and it's getting worse, not better. If this is my shot at fixing things, I'll take it.",
  "system1": "Three weeks in Costa Rica with Heroic Hearts. Twenty years back and it's getting worse - the nightmares, the anger, Amanda at her wit's end.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without waking up screaming, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user1": "I... I don't know. Haven't thought about it like that.\n\nMaybe I'd wake up and not feel like I need to check every room in the house. Maybe I could sit through breakfast without feeling like I need to leave the table. Amanda wouldn't look at me like she's walking on eggshells.\n\nI guess... I guess I'd feel like I did before I deployed. Like myself again. Not this... this thing that jumps at shadows.\n\nMy kids wouldn't flinch when I raise my voice. I could take them to the park without scanning rooftops. Little things. Normal things.",
  "system2": "Not checking rooms, sitting through breakfast, Amanda not walking on eggshells. Your kids not flinching when you raise your voice.\n\nWhat's underneath the hypervigilance? What part of you is still back there, scanning rooftops during a trip to the park?",
  "user2": "I don't... it's just being prepared. That's all. Better safe than sorry.\n\nBut I guess... I guess part of me is still up there. In the cockpit. Watching everything from above, trying to see problems before they happen. Trying to keep people safe.\n\nOnly now there's no mission. Just... normal life. And I'm still looking for threats that aren't there. Still trying to protect everyone from an enemy that's not coming.\n\nI don't know how to stand down. How to just... be here.",
  "system3": "Part of you still in the cockpit, watching from above, protecting from threats that aren't coming. No mission, just normal life, and you don't know how to stand down.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to be here instead of up there?",
  "user3": "I don't... I can't really...\n\nMy shoulders would drop, maybe. They're always tight, like I'm bracing for something. My jaw too\u2014I catch myself clenching it, grinding my teeth. \n\nI'd breathe different. Not these shallow breaths, always ready to... I don't know, react to something. I'd take a deep breath and it wouldn't feel like I was wasting time.\n\nI guess I'd feel heavy in a good way. Like I could sit in a chair and actually feel it holding me up instead of perching on the edge, ready to move. \n\nAmanda says I never relax. Never just... exist. I don't know what that feels like anymore.",
  "system4": "Shoulders dropping, jaw unclenching, breathing deep instead of shallow. Sitting in a chair and feeling it hold you up instead of perching on the edge.\n\nThree main threads here:\n\n1. Finding peace from the nightmares so you and Amanda can sleep together again\n2. Teaching your body it's home now, not back there - learning to stand down when there's no mission\n3. Being present with your kids without scanning for threats, feeling that good heavy instead of constant readiness\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Yeah... yeah, that about covers it.\n\nI just... I need this to work. Amanda's been patient for twenty years but I see it in her eyes, she's getting tired. My kids deserve better than a father who's half here and half somewhere else.\n\nI don't care about the spiritual stuff or whatever. I just want to sleep. Want to sit at my own dinner table without feeling like I need to leave. Want to take my son to a baseball game without checking every exit.\n\nIf this plant medicine can help me do that... I'll take whatever it gives me.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I teach my body it's home now, learning to stand down when there's no mission\n3. I embrace being present with my kids without scanning for threats\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "The second one. About teaching my body it's home now.\n\nCan we say it simpler though? Something like... \"I learn to stand down when there's no mission.\" Or \"I teach my body we're home now, not back there.\"\n\nI don't know. The words feel... I don't know what I'm doing here. But that one feels like it gets to the heart of it. Always being ready to move, to react, to protect\u2014it's exhausting. And it's not helping anyone anymore.\n\nThe other two matter, but if I can't get past that one... the rest won't matter anyway.",
  "system6": "\u221a Intention 2 locked in: \"I teach my body we're home now, not back there\"\n\nThat shift to simpler language - that's your voice. Military direct.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user6": "The sleep one... I need that one too. But \"I welcome peaceful sleep\" sounds like something from a greeting card.\n\nHow about \"I sleep through the night without waking up fighting\"? Or just \"I sleep through the night.\"\n\nThe kids one... \"I embrace being present\" sounds like therapy talk. Maybe \"I'm here with my kids, not watching for danger\"? Or \"I watch my kids play without looking for threats\"?\n\nI don't know. This feels... I feel stupid talking like this. But if I'm going to do this thing, I should say it how I'd actually say it.",
  "system7": "\"I sleep through the night\" - clean, direct. That works.\n\n\"I watch my kids play without looking for threats\" - that's your voice. That's how you'd actually say it.\n\nBoth feel right?",
  "user7": "Yeah. Both feel right.\n\nI keep thinking about my daughter's last soccer game. She scored and looked over at me, and I was scanning the parking lot. I missed it. I missed her moment because I was looking for something that wasn't there.\n\nSo yeah. I want to watch my kids play without looking for threats. And I want to sleep through the night.",
  "system8": "\u221a Intention 1 locked in: \"I sleep through the night\"\n\n\u221a Intention 3 locked in: \"I watch my kids play without looking for threats\"\n\nThree solid intentions:\n- I sleep through the night\n- I teach my body we're home now, not back there  \n- I watch my kids play without looking for threats\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card in your wallet\n- Read them during morning coffee\n- Keep them in your truck\n- Read them before bed\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user8": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet with my pilot's license\u2014been carrying that thing for twenty years. Seems... seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe read them when I have my morning coffee. That's usually the only quiet moment I get before the day starts coming at me.\n\nI don't know if it'll help. But I guess if I'm going to Costa Rica to drink some plant medicine, I should at least try to do this part right.",
  "system9": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I sleep through the night\n- I teach my body we're home now, not back there\n- I watch my kids play without looking for threats\n\nYour ritual: Keep them with your pilot's license, read them with morning coffee.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user9": "Three weeks.\n\nI'll... I'll do my best. That's all I can promise. I just want to come back and be someone worth coming home to.\n\nTell me straight\u2014what if this doesn't work? What if I drink this stuff and I'm still the same guy who can't sit through dinner without needing to move?",
  "system10": "Then you're still the guy who showed up and tried something different. That's not nothing.\n\nThe medicine doesn't always give what you ask for. Sometimes it gives what you need, and that takes longer to recognize. Sometimes the change comes slow - you notice six months later that you sat through a whole meal without planning your escape route.\n\nYou're doing the work. The outcome isn't yours to control.",
  "user10": "Yeah. I guess that's the hardest part for me\u2014letting go of the outcome. Always been able to make things happen if I worked hard enough, pushed through.\n\nBut this... this isn't a mission I can plan out. That's what scares me the most.",
  "system11": "Letting go of the outcome - that's the real mission here.\n\nYou know how to push through. You don't know how to surrender. That's what this medicine asks of you.\n\nThree weeks to practice something you've never trained for.",
  "user11": "Never been good at surrender. Always thought that was weakness. You push through, you fight, you win. That's how it works.\n\nBut I keep thinking about what you said\u2014about sitting through a whole meal six months later. Maybe that's worth trying something different for. Even if it feels like I'm walking into a fight without my weapons.",
  "system12": "Walking into a fight without your weapons - that's exactly what surrender feels like to a soldier.\n\nBut maybe your weapons aren't what you think they are. Maybe showing up unarmed is the whole point.\n\nThree weeks to find out what happens when you stop fighting everything, including yourself.",
  "user12": "Three weeks to stop fighting. Even myself.\n\nThat's... that's a hell of a mission.",
  "system13": "It is. And it's yours now.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "user13": "Three weeks.",
  "system14": "You\u2019ve got this. Three weeks.",
  "user14": "Yeah. Three weeks.",
  "system15": "Good. You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user15": "Heroic Hearts got me in. Said this plant medicine might help with... with what happens at night. The nightmares. Amanda\u2014my wife\u2014she's about had it with me waking up shouting, snapping at everyone. \n\nI don't buy into all this spiritual stuff, but the guys at Heroic Hearts, they're solid. Former military. They wouldn't steer me wrong. And if I don't do something, I'm gonna lose her. That's what it comes down to.",
  "system16": "Heroic Hearts got you in - they know what they're doing. Former military guys wouldn't send you on a fool's mission.\n\nNightmares, waking up shouting, Amanda ready to walk. That's what's on the line.\n\nWhat happens in these nightmares? What are you seeing when you wake up shouting?",
  "user16": "I don't... it's not like I remember them clear. Just flashes. Sometimes it's the aircraft, sometimes it's... it's the missions. Things that went wrong. People who didn't make it back.\n\nI wake up and my heart's pounding like I'm still there. Amanda says I'm shouting names\u2014guys I flew with. But when I wake up, I can't... I can't grab hold of what I was seeing. Just this feeling like I'm still in it. Like I never really left.\n\nIt's not PTSD. I don't have that. I just need to sleep better.",
  "system17": "Heart pounding like you're still there. Shouting names of guys who didn't make it back. But you never really left - that's what your body's telling you.\n\nWhat would it feel like to actually be home? Not just physically here, but really home in your body, your bed, with Amanda?",
  "user17": "I... I don't know if I remember what that feels like anymore. Being *home* home. Not just walking through the door and hanging up my keys.\n\nMaybe... maybe it'd be like before the tours. When I'd come to bed and Amanda would already be asleep, and I'd just... fit. Slide in behind her and she'd kind of settle back against me without waking up. That feeling like I was exactly where I belonged.\n\nNow I sleep on my back, arms crossed over my chest. Like I'm in a damn coffin. Don't even realize I'm doing it. Amanda says I flinch when she touches me in the dark.",
  "system18": "Exactly where you belonged - sliding in behind her, fitting together. Now you're sleeping like you're in a coffin, flinching when she touches you in the dark.\n\nThree main threads:\n\n1. Finding peace from the nightmares so you can rest through the night\n2. Teaching your body it's home now, not back there - safe enough to sleep beside Amanda again\n3. Reclaiming that feeling of belonging, of being exactly where you're supposed to be\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user18": "Yeah... yeah, that about covers it. I want to sleep through the damn night without waking up drenched. Want to feel like this house is actually mine, not just somewhere I'm passing through. And I want... I want to be the man Amanda married, not whatever this is I've become.\n\nHow do we turn that into these intention things?",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep through the night without the nightmares\n2. I reclaim feeling at home in my own house and body\n3. I become the man Amanda married - present and connected\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to sound more like your voice?",
  "user19": "The first one\u2014about sleeping through the night. That's... that's what I need. I can't keep going like this, barely functioning on four hours of broken sleep.\n\nBut \"I welcome peaceful sleep\"? That sounds like something off a damn greeting card. I'm not welcoming anything. I just want it to stop. The dreams, the shouting, the waking up feeling like I'm still in that cockpit.\n\nHow about... \"I sleep through the night without the dreams pulling me back there.\" Something like that?"
