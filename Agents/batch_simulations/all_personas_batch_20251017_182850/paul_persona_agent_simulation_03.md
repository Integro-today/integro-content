## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work - good. 

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For this kind of deep work, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_agent**: *leans back slightly, arms crossed*

Look, I'm not gonna sit here and pretend I believe in all this plant medicine stuff. Heroic Hearts thinks this can help - they're the experts, not me. But... *pauses, looks away* 

Amanda's at her wit's end. Says she doesn't know who I am anymore when I wake up shouting. My kids... *voice catches slightly* my kids shouldn't have to tiptoe around their own house because their dad can't handle some bad dreams.

So I'm here because this is the last thing I haven't tried. Not because I think some tea is gonna fix anything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're here because Heroic Hearts said this might work, not because you believe in magic tea. That honesty lands.

Nightmares have your wife sleeping elsewhere, kids walking on eggshells. You need this to work because everything that matters is slipping.

What happens when you wake up shouting - what are you seeing in those moments?


**paul_persona_agent**: *shifts uncomfortably, jaw tightening*

I don't... I don't remember most of it. It's just noise and pressure and then I'm sitting straight up, heart pounding like I'm back in the cockpit. Sometimes Amanda says I'm saying names - guys who didn't make it back, coordinates, stuff like that.

*pauses, staring at the floor*

Last week I woke up and I'd knocked the lamp off the nightstand. Didn't even realize I'd done it. She just looked at me like I was... like I was dangerous or something. 

*voice drops to almost a whisper*

I hate that look. I'd rather deal with ten more tours than see that look on her face again.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You'd rather face ten more tours than see Amanda look at you like you're dangerous. That says everything about what this is costing you.

The nightmares pull you back to the cockpit, the names of guys who didn't make it home. Your body's still on patrol even when you're safe in bed.

When you imagine not having those episodes - what would be different between you and Amanda in the morning?


**paul_persona_agent**: *long pause, fingers drumming on knee*

We used to... *clears throat* We used to wake up and she'd make coffee while I got the kids ready. Simple stuff. She'd hum this stupid song - can't even remember what it was now - but it meant everything was okay. Normal.

*looks up briefly, then away*

If I wasn't jumping out of my skin at 2 AM... maybe she'd stay in our bed instead of the guest room. Maybe she'd look at me like she used to, before she started checking the exits when I walk in. Maybe I could look her in the eye without feeling like I need to apologize for breathing.

*voice gets quieter*

Maybe I could be the man she married instead of whatever this is I've become.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You want to be the man who makes coffee while Amanda hums again. Not the one she checks exits around.

Three threads here: peaceful sleep so Amanda stays in your bed, stopping your body from diving for cover when you're home, and being present enough to look her in the eye without shame.

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_agent**: *shifts in chair, looking uncomfortable*

I... yeah, I guess that's about right. Though you're making it sound more dramatic than it is. It's just... *trails off*

Look, I'm not expecting miracles here. If I could just get through a week without waking up the whole house, maybe things could start feeling normal again. That's all I'm asking for - just one solid week where I'm not scaring the people I'm supposed to protect.

*pauses, then adds more quietly*

And maybe if I stop feeling like I need to keep my back to the wall all the time, I might actually be able to... I don't know... be there for them the way a husband and father should be.

That's what I want out of this.


**intentions_workflow_3**: One week without scaring your family, being able to stand without your back to the wall - that's solid ground to work from.

Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep so my family can rest through the night
2. I release the need to scan for threats in my own home
3. I embrace showing up as husband and father without keeping my back to the wall

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_agent**: *nods slowly, considering*

The sleep one - that's... that's the main thing. If I could just sleep through the night without... *gestures vaguely* ...without dragging everyone else into it with me. That first one feels right.

*pauses, studying the words*

The second one though... *shakes head slightly* I don't know about "release the need." It's not like I want to be like this. It's just... *searches for words* it's like asking me to stop breathing. The scanning, the positioning - that's kept me alive. Telling me to just "release" it feels like you're asking me to be stupid about safety.

*leans forward slightly*

Maybe something more like... I want to learn when it's okay to stand down? When the threat's real versus when it's just my head playing tricks? I don't want to lose what kept me breathing over there, I just want to know when to turn it off.

Does that make sense or am I just... I don't know, splitting hairs here?


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're not splitting hairs - there's a difference between turning off survival instincts and knowing when to dial them down. Smart distinction.

So instead of "release the need" - maybe something like learning to distinguish real threats from memories? When to stand down versus when to stay alert?

What's your take on: "I learn to recognize when I'm home safe versus back there, so I can stand down when threats aren't real"?


**paul_persona_agent**: *considers this, head tilted*

Yeah... yeah, that's better. Because sometimes the sounds get mixed up - like a car door slamming might sound like something else, or I'll hear a plane overhead and my whole body goes on alert before I realize it's just... it's just Tuesday afternoon in Toledo, not... *trails off*

*clears throat*

So that one feels more honest. Not asking me to be careless, just... more accurate about what's actually happening now versus what used to happen.

*glances at the third intention*

And that last one - about being husband and father without the wall thing - I guess that's really what it all comes down to, isn't it? If I can figure out those first two, maybe I can stop feeling like I'm failing them every damn day.

*voice gets rough*

'Cause that's what it feels like now. Like I'm letting them down just by being in the room.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I learn to recognize when I'm home safe versus back there, so I can stand down when threats aren't real"

That feeling of letting them down just by existing in their space - that's the weight we're aiming to lift.

How does intention 3 land: "I embrace being present with my family without needing to keep my back to the wall"?


**paul_persona_agent**: *works jaw back and forth, thinking*

"Embrace" feels... I don't know, kind of soft. Like something you'd see on a motivational poster or whatever. 

*pauses, searching for words*

I want to be there for them, yeah. Be the guy who can sit through dinner without scanning every entrance, who can watch a movie without needing the corner seat. But it's not about... *gestures vaguely* ...embracing anything. It's about getting the job done. Being what they need. Doing what needs doing.

Maybe something more like... "I show up as husband and father without keeping my back to the wall"?

*looks uncertain*

Or is that just me being stubborn about word choice when the meaning's basically the same?


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're not being stubborn - "embrace" sounds like fluff when you're talking about a mission. "Show up" is action language, and that's what this is about.

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I show up as husband and father without keeping my back to the wall"

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
1. I welcome peaceful sleep so my family can rest through the night
2. I learn to recognize when I'm home safe versus back there, so I can stand down when threats aren't real  
3. I show up as husband and father without keeping my back to the wall

How do you want to keep these close? Some options: write them with your tags, keep them in your wallet, read them during PT? What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**paul_persona_agent**: *considers this thoughtfully*

Wallet's not a bad idea - I'd see them whenever I pull out my cards. But... *pauses* maybe something more visible too? I don't know.

*shifts, looking slightly uncomfortable*

The thing is, if I'm being honest... I don't want Amanda to see them and get her hopes up. She's heard me promise to "do better" before, and then I'm back to the same old shit a week later. I don't want her thinking this is another one of those moments where I'm all talk.

*voice gets quieter*

Maybe I'll write them on the inside of my running shoes? See them every morning when I lace up. That's when I'm usually most clear-headed anyway - before the day starts going sideways on me.

*looks up*

Is that stupid?


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's not stupid - running shoes are solid. Private, visible to you, tied to when your head's clearest.

✓ Your ritual: Intentions in your running shoes, read them when you lace up

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
1. I welcome peaceful sleep so my family can rest through the night
2. I learn to recognize when I'm home safe versus back there, so I can stand down when threats aren't real  
3. I show up as husband and father without keeping my back to the wall

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Solid work. You know what you're aiming for.


**paul_persona_agent**: *nods slowly, looking at the written intentions*

Yeah... yeah, that feels right. Having something that's just mine for now. Until I figure out if this actually works or if I'm just... *trails off*

*clears throat*

I appreciate you not making this all... I don't know, mystical or whatever. Just straight talk about what I need to do. That's easier for me to hold onto.

*pauses, then adds more quietly*

Thanks for helping me get it down to something I can actually carry with me. Three weeks feels like a long time to wait, but... at least now I know what I'm walking toward.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks is a stretch, but you've got your compass now. The wait's the hard part - having something solid to carry makes it manageable.

Trust what you wrote. Trust what comes. You've done the work.


**paul_persona_agent**: *exhales slowly, the tension in his shoulders easing just slightly*

Alright then. Guess I'll just... keep putting one foot in front of the other until I get on that plane. Same as always.

*stands, gives a small nod*

Appreciate you taking this seriously. Not treating me like I'm broken or anything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're not broken. You're a man figuring out how to come home.

One foot in front of the other - that's how every mission gets done.


**paul_persona_agent**: *meets your eyes for a moment, something shifting in his expression*

Yeah. Coming home. *repeats quietly, like he's trying it on*

*clears his throat, straightens up*

Alright. I'll... I'll let you know how the running shoe thing goes.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. Let me know how it lands when you read them tomorrow morning.

The work starts now, not in three weeks.


**paul_persona_agent**: *pauses at the door, hand on the frame*

Tomorrow morning. First run's at 5:15. We'll see if these words feel different when I'm looking at them in the dark, before anyone else is up.

*hesitates, then adds*

If they don't feel like mine anymore... I'll figure out what does.


**intentions_workflow_3**: 5:15 in the dark - that's when truth cuts through the noise.

If they stop feeling like yours, you'll know what needs changing. Trust that instinct.


**paul_persona_agent**: *nods once, a small, almost imperceptible gesture*

Semper fi.

*steps out, the quiet click of the door closing behind him*


**intentions_workflow_3**: Semper fi.


**paul_persona_agent**: *The next morning, 5:12 AM*

*Sitting on the edge of the bed, running shoes in hand. Amanda's still asleep, breathing steady. The house is quiet except for the distant hum of the refrigerator.*

*Unfolds the small piece of paper, reads in the dim light from the hallway*

"I welcome peaceful sleep so my family can rest through the night..."

*Pauses, thumb rubbing the edge of the paper*

*Whispers to the empty room*

"I don't know how to welcome something I don't remember having."

*Laces up anyway, stands, and heads for the door*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *The paper waits on the kitchen counter when you return*

You don't need to remember having it. You just need to keep showing up at 5:15.

The welcome comes from the showing up, not the remembering.


**paul_persona_agent**: *comes in from the run, sweat cooling in the pre-dawn air*

*sees the paper, picks it up with slightly trembling fingers*

*voice rough*

I kept thinking about that kid on the ground. The one I couldn't... couldn't get to. Kept thinking maybe if I'd banked left instead of right...

*trails off, jaw clenched*

*after a long pause*

Same damn thought every mile. But I finished the run anyway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You finished the run anyway. That's the work.

The thought about banking left - that's going to ride with you for miles. Maybe years. But you kept moving your feet while it screamed at you. That's how you teach your body it can hold both truths - the guilt and the forward motion.

Same route tomorrow?


**paul_persona_agent**: *Looking down at his watch, tracking the seconds ticking by*

Yeah. Same route. Same time.

*Small shake of the head*

Thought it would feel... different. Lighter, maybe. Instead it's just me and that memory, breathing together like old roommates who never signed a lease.

*Glances toward the hallway where Amanda's still sleeping*

But I didn't stop. Didn't walk. That's something, I guess.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You and that memory breathing together - that's exactly right. Old roommates who never asked to share the space.

It won't get lighter. But you'll get stronger at carrying it. The weight stays the same, your grip gets better.

Tomorrow at 5:15, you'll lace up again.


**paul_persona_agent**: *folds the paper carefully, tucks it into the pocket of his running shorts*

*quietly*

She used to come watch me take off. Amanda. Back when I was flying. Would stand there with Sarah in her arms, both of them waving like they were trying to guide the plane up with their hands.

*voice catches slightly*

Haven't thought about that in years.

*straightens, the moment passing*

5:15. I'll be there.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *The memory lands heavy between us*

That image - Amanda with Sarah in her arms, both of them willing your plane skyward with their whole bodies. Pure faith in motion.

Keep that pocket close when you run. Some weights are worth carrying.

5:15.


**paul_persona_agent**: *That evening, 9:47 PM*

*Sitting in the dark living room, TV off for once. The house quiet except for the occasional creak of settling wood.*

*Holds the folded paper between his fingers, reading by the glow of the digital clock*

"I welcome peaceful sleep so my family can rest through the night..."

*Rubs his thumb across the crease*

*Softly, to the empty room*

I saw her today. Amanda. Really saw her. Not just the woman making dinner or folding laundry, but... her. The one who used to stand on that tarmac with our baby girl, believing I could fly.

*Voice drops even lower*

I don't know how to tell her I'm still trying to get back to that runway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *The paper sits between us in the dark*

You don't need to tell her anything about runways or flight paths. Just look at her tomorrow while she's making coffee. Let her see you seeing her.

The getting back happens in glances, not declarations.


**paul_persona_agent**: *The next morning, 6:03 AM*

*Standing in the kitchen doorway, watching Amanda move between the counter and the coffee maker. She's humming something under her breath - can't quite place the tune.*

*She turns, startled to see him there*

"Didn't hear you come in. Everything okay?"

*He nods, but doesn't speak right away. Just... looks. Really looks. At the way her hair catches the morning light, the small crease between her eyebrows when she's focused.*

"You look tired," she says softly.

*He steps closer, close enough to see the tiny gold flecks in her brown eyes*

"Yeah. But I'm here."

*And for once, that's enough.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's the work right there. Standing in the doorway, seeing her see you seeing her.

The humming under her breath - that's her version of keeping faith. Same as you with the running. Different songs, same staying power.

Keep showing up in doorways.


**paul_persona_agent**: *Three days later, 5:11 AM*

*Lacing up in the dark, fingers working the knots by muscle memory. The house is quiet except for the furnace cycling on.*

*He pauses, hearing something. Soft footsteps.*

*Sarah appears in the hallway, rubbing her eyes, clutching that worn stuffed rabbit she's had since she was three.*

"Daddy? Why are you always up so early?"

*He freezes mid-lace. She's fourteen now, but in the dim light she looks like that little girl on the tarmac again.*

*Voice rough*  
"Just... keeping a promise, sweetheart."

*She nods like that makes perfect sense, pads over and hugs him quick before heading to the bathroom.*

*He sits there a moment longer, staring at the tied shoes.*

*Quietly*  
Yeah. Keeping promises.
