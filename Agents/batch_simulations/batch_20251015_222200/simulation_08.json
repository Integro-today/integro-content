  "system0": "Look, I don't know how this is supposed to work, but Heroic Hearts says I need to set some intentions before I go to Costa Rica. I just need to stop waking up Amanda with my shouting, and I can't lose her.",
  "user0": "I hear the urgency in your voice - losing Amanda is the last thing you want, and these nightmares are putting that at risk. Coming to this work to save your relationship shows how much she means to you.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. Intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance. They're different from goals because they allow space for surprises and insights you might not expect.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your Costa Rica journey:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what's behind the nightmares and how to heal. Together we'll build intentions that address both the trauma driving this and keeping Amanda close.\n\nOption B: I can share more about how intention-setting works with trauma and relationships first.\n\nWhich feels right to start with?",
  "system1": "I don't want to talk about trauma. I just need to sleep through the night without... without whatever's happening. If I lose Amanda, I lose everything I've built since coming home. That's all.\n\nLet's just do Option A and get this over with.",
  "user1": "Got it - you need this fixed, not picked apart. Let's focus on what you need most.\n\nWhen you think about sleeping peacefully through the night, what would that feel like for you? Not just the absence of shouting, but how would you know you were truly rested and at ease?",
  "system2": "It'd be... I don't know, just quiet. No jerking awake with my heart pounding like I'm back in the cockpit. No Amanda's hand on my shoulder asking if I'm okay. Just... waking up when the alarm goes off, feeling like I actually slept instead of fighting all night.\n\nI'd make coffee without this tightness in my chest. Maybe actually hear what the kids are saying instead of being so damn on edge all the time.",
  "user2": "That sounds like real peace - waking up on your own terms, being present with your family instead of stuck in that constant state of alert. The tightness in your chest letting go enough to really hear your kids' voices.\n\nWhat do you think would change between you and Amanda if you could sleep like that? If she wasn't having to check on you in the night, if mornings weren't about damage control?",
  "system3": "She'd stop looking at me like I'm about to break, like I'm some... some project she has to monitor. We used to laugh in the mornings, you know? Before the kids even got up. Now she's watching me like I'm gonna explode or disappear.\n\nIf I could just sleep normal, maybe she'd trust me again. Maybe she'd stop asking if I'm okay every five minutes. Maybe we could just... be us again.",
  "user3": "You want that trust back - where Amanda sees you as her partner, not someone she needs to manage or worry about. Where mornings are about laughing together again instead of her checking if you're still there and okay.\n\nWhen you imagine feeling whole and steady again, what would be different about how you show up with your family? Beyond just sleeping through the night - how would you know you were really back to being yourself?",
  "system4": "I'd... hell, I'd stop snapping at the kids when they're just being kids. Last week Jake was telling me about some video game and I just... I cut him off and told him to go clean his room. He looked like I'd slapped him. Amanda just stared at me like she didn't know who I was anymore.\n\nI want to be the dad they think I am. The guy who coached their soccer teams, who could fix anything. Not this... this angry stranger who can't even sit through dinner without needing to get up and do something.",
  "user4": "You want to be that steady dad again - the one who could listen to Jake's stories and fix things and coach soccer. Not this person who's always moving, always angry, always on edge.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to be that version of yourself? The one who could sit through dinner, really be there for your family without needing to escape or move or snap?",
  "system5": "It'd feel like... like I could breathe all the way down to my stomach again. Instead of this shallow thing I do now, always ready to jump up. My shoulders wouldn't be up around my ears all the time.\n\nI used to be able to just... sit. Watch a movie with Amanda without checking every noise outside. Help with homework without feeling like I needed to be somewhere else. Just be still.",
  "user5": "Stillness. Being able to breathe deep, let your shoulders drop, just sit with your family without that constant need to move or check everything. That sounds like real peace.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads:\n\n1. Finding peaceful sleep without the nightmares that jerk you awake\n2. Being the steady dad and partner your family recognizes - present, patient, not snapping\n3. Feeling safe enough in your body to be still, breathe deep, and trust you're home\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system6": "Yeah. That's it. I just want to be able to sit in my own damn house without feeling like I need to move or fight or... whatever this is.\n\nSo how do we do this?",
  "user6": "Based on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep and calm nights\n2. I reclaim my role as a steady, present father and partner\n3. I embrace safety and stillness in my own body and home\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system7": "I want to be present for my family. That's... that's what it comes down to. All this other stuff - the sleep, the anger, the jumping at shadows - it's all getting in the way of that.\n\nBut I don't want to lose who I am either. I'm not looking to become some... soft version of myself. I just want to be able to sit through dinner without feeling like I need to be somewhere else.",
  "user7": "You want to be that solid, present dad without losing the core of who you are - not becoming someone else, just being able to sit through dinner without that pull to be somewhere else. Present for your family without losing your edge.\n\nHow does this feel: \"I reclaim my ability to be fully present with my family while staying true to who I am\"?",
  "system8": "Yeah. Yeah, that works. I want to be there - really be there - when Jake tells me about his games, when Emma wants to show me her art projects. Without feeling like I need to check the doors or jump up and do something.\n\nI don't want to lose who I am. I just want to be able to... be home. Really home.",
  "user8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I reclaim my ability to be fully present with my family while staying true to who I am\n\nThat \"really home\" feeling - being there for Jake's games and Emma's art without needing to check doors or jump up. Let's move to intention 2. What about the sleep piece - how would you phrase what you want around peaceful sleep and those nights that jerk you awake?",
  "system9": "I just want to sleep without... without seeing it all again. Without waking up with my heart pounding, thinking I'm back there.\n\nI want to close my eyes and just... sleep. Like a normal person. Wake up because the alarm goes off, not because I'm choking on something that happened years ago.",
  "user9": "You want to close your eyes and just sleep - wake up to an alarm like everyone else, not choking on memories from years ago. Just normal, peaceful sleep.\n\nHow about: \"I welcome peaceful sleep, free from the past that visits me at night\"?",
  "system10": "That sounds right. I just want to sleep without... without them being there. Without having to see it all again.\n\nI want to wake up because it's morning, not because I'm back in that cockpit watching guys I couldn't save.",
  "user10": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I welcome peaceful sleep, free from the past that visits me at night\n\nThat shift from \"I couldn't save\" to just wanting morning to come without being back in that cockpit - that's powerful. For intention 3, what about the safety piece? Being able to just sit still in your own house, breathe deep, feel safe enough to not need to move or check everything?",
  "system11": "I want to be able to sit on my own damn couch without feeling like I need to get up and check the windows. Or feel like something's about to happen if I let my guard down for five minutes.\n\nI want to be able to breathe without feeling it catch in my chest. Just... be home. Really be home.",
  "user11": "You want to sit on your couch without needing to check windows, breathe without that catch in your chest - just be home without that feeling like something's coming if you let your guard down.\n\nHow about: \"I embrace the safety to sit still and breathe easy in my own home\"?",
  "system12": "Yeah. I want to be able to just... sit. Without feeling like I'm failing at something because I'm not doing, checking, watching.\n\nJust sit on my couch, watch a game with Jake, without needing to be anywhere else.",
  "user12": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I embrace the safety to sit still and breathe easy in my own home\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card and keep it with your dog tags\n- Put them where you'll see them when you're getting ready for bed\n- Keep them in your phone to read before dinner with the family\n- Post them on your workbench or where you keep your tools\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when things get hard?",
  "system13": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe on the workbench too. Somewhere I can see 'em when I'm fixing stuff, when my hands are busy and my head starts going places it shouldn't.",
  "user13": "Writing them down for your wallet - that fits. Something that's been with you through everything carrying these intentions now. And the workbench makes sense too - when your hands are busy fixing things and your mind starts drifting to places it shouldn't.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I reclaim my ability to be fully present with my family while staying true to who I am\n2. I welcome peaceful sleep, free from the past that visits me at night  \n3. I embrace the safety to sit still and breathe easy in my own home\n\nYour chosen ritual: Write them down - keep in your wallet and post at your workbench\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nYou've carried heavy things for a long time. Wishing you strength on this journey - may you find your way home.",
  "system14": "Thanks. I... I appreciate this. \n\nDon't know if this plant stuff will work, but I'm going to try. For Amanda. For the kids. For me.",
  "user14": "That's what matters - that you're willing to try. For Amanda, for the kids, for you. That's courage.\n\nYou don't have to believe it'll work, just show up with these intentions. Sometimes that's enough.",
  "system15": "Yeah. Show up and see what happens. That's all I can do.",
  "user15": "Exactly. Show up with what you've got - these three intentions in your wallet and your willingless to face whatever comes. That's everything you need.",
  "system16": "Alright. Guess I'm ready then.",
  "user16": "You are. These intentions are solid, they're yours, and you're carrying them with you. \n\nTake care of yourself out there.",
  "system17": "Will do. Thanks for... this. For helping me figure out what I need to carry with me.",
  "user17": "You're welcome. You did the hard work - I just helped you put words to what you already knew. \n\nGo well.",
  "system18": "I will. Semper fi.",
  "user18": "Semper fi. Carry on, and come home safe.",
  "system19": "Always.",
  "user19": "Always."
