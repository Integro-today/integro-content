  "system0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with my nightmares, help me keep Amanda. I can't keep going like this\u2014waking up shouting, watching her flinch like I'm some stranger.",
  "user0": "I hear the pain in your voice - the desperation of watching your relationship crumble while feeling powerless to stop it. The nightmares aren't just stealing your sleep; they're stealing your connection with Amanda. Coming to ayahuasca when you're this raw takes real courage.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points toward what you need most without forcing a specific outcome. These medicines work best when we give them direction rather than leaving everything to chance. They're not rigid goals, more like gentle north stars that help guide the healing.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your ceremony:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions about what you're hoping to heal or understand. Together we'll build intentions that feel authentic to you - whether that's finding peace from the nightmares, healing what drives them, or rebuilding trust with Amanda.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with trauma and relationships first, including examples from other veterans.\n\nWhich feels right to you?",
  "system1": "I... I don't know. Option A, I guess. I just need this to work. I can't lose her.",
  "user1": "I understand the urgency - when everything feels like it's slipping away, we reach for whatever might help us hold on.\n\nLet's start here: can you tell me more about these nightmares? What happens in them that leaves you shouting in the dark?",
  "system2": "They're just... flashes. Sometimes it's the missions, sometimes it's the guys we lost. Last night I was back in the cockpit and I couldn't pull up\u2014kept diving straight toward the ground. Amanda said I was yelling \"Eject! Eject!\" but I couldn't move. \n\nOther times it's just... darkness. Like I'm falling forever. I wake up and she's already moved to the couch. Won't look at me the next morning.",
  "user2": "That sounds terrifying - being trapped in that cockpit, knowing what's coming but unable to stop it. And then waking up to find Amanda's already retreated to the couch... that distance must feel like a different kind of crash.\n\nWhen did these nightmares start getting worse? Was there something specific that shifted recently, or have they been building since you got back?",
  "system3": "They've been there since I got back\u2014some nights worse than others. But lately... I don't know, maybe the past six months? Amanda started sleeping in the guest room more. Said she needs rest for work, but I know it's me. \n\nNothing specific happened. Just... building up, I guess. Like pressure in a pipe. She asked me to talk to someone last month. Said I scare her when I wake up like that. I told her I don't need help, I'm fine. But I'm not fine, am I?",
  "user3": "No, you're not fine - and recognizing that takes more strength than pretending everything's okay. That pressure building up for six months... it's like your body and mind are trying to process what happened over there, but it's coming out at night when your guard is down.\n\nWhat scares you most about these nightmares? Is it the reliving itself, or what they're doing to Amanda - watching her pull further away each time you wake up shouting?",
  "system4": "Both. I hate... I hate that she sees me like that. Weak. Out of control. I'm supposed to be her rock, you know? Not some broken... \n\n[trails off]\n\nShe used to look at me like I could fix anything. Now she looks at me like I might break. Like she's walking on eggshells. I hear her on the phone with her sister\u2014\"he's just not the same.\" \n\nI need to be the man she married again. Not... this.",
  "user4": "That shame of being seen as broken when you used to be the one who could handle anything - that's a heavy burden to carry. And hearing her tell her sister you're \"not the same\" must cut deep.\n\nBut here's something I'm wondering: underneath needing to be the man she married again, what do you actually want to heal? Is it about stopping the nightmares so she'll stay, or is there something deeper that needs peace - something from those missions that your mind keeps trying to process at night?",
  "system5": "I... I don't want to think about those missions. I did what I had to do. That's war. People die. You move on.\n\n[long pause]\n\nBut it's like... it's like I'm still there sometimes. Like I never really left. The sounds, the smells\u2014I'll be driving to work and suddenly I'm back. Heart pounding, hands clenched on the wheel. \n\nI just want it to stop. I want to sleep through the night. I want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm a stranger in our bed. I want to be present for my kids without this... this shadow hanging over everything.\n\nI don't need to process anything. I just need it to go away.",
  "user5": "I hear you - wanting it to just stop, to not have to relive any of it. That makes sense. But I'm also hearing something else underneath: this feeling of never really leaving that place, of still being there in your body even when you're driving to work. That's not just about the nightmares - that's about carrying something heavy that won't let you go.\n\nWhen you imagine being truly present for your kids, what does that look like? What would be different from how things are now?",
  "system6": "I... I'd actually hear what they're saying instead of just nodding while my mind's somewhere else. My daughter was telling me about her science project last week and I caught myself scanning the restaurant, checking exits, watching people's hands. \n\nI'd be able to take them to the park without getting jumpy when a car backfires. My son wants to learn to ride a bike and I keep putting it off because... what if I panic when he falls? What if I can't handle it?\n\nAmanda wants family game nights. I sit there but I'm not really there. I'm counting down until bedtime, until I can be alone with the TV. Until the next nightmare.\n\nI want to be the dad who can just... be. Without all this noise in my head.",
  "user6": "That image of yourself - just being present without the noise, without scanning every room or jumping at sounds - that's powerful. And I can feel how much you want this for your kids, to be the dad who can really hear them and teach your son to ride that bike.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding peace from the war that's still living in your body and mind\n2. Reclaiming your role as present father and partner, not just physically there but emotionally available\n3. Letting go of the shame and self-judgment about needing help\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system7": "Yeah... yeah, that's it. I guess. \n\n[pause]\n\nBut I need to be clear - I still need to be strong. I can't... I can't turn into some emotional mess. My kids need to know their dad can handle things. Amanda needs to feel safe with me.\n\nSo if we're doing this... I want to find peace without losing myself. Without becoming someone they can't respect. I need to keep being the guy who gets things done, just... without all the baggage dragging me down.\n\nCan we write it like that?",
  "user7": "Absolutely - you're not looking to become someone else, you're looking to carry less so you can be more of who you already are underneath all this weight.\n\nBased on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to releasing the war that's still living in my body, finding peace without losing my strength\n2. I reclaim my ability to be fully present with my children and Amanda, showing up as the father and partner they deserve\n3. I welcome healing that allows me to stay capable and strong while letting go of what no longer serves me or my family\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system8": "The second one. That's... that's what I want most. To actually be there for them. Not just sitting at the table but somewhere else in my head.\n\nBut I need to say it different. More like me. Something like... \"I will learn to be present with my family again, without all this crap getting in the way. I'll show up for Amanda and the kids the way they deserve.\"\n\nThe other two... I guess I need them too. But that's the one that hits me hardest.",
  "user8": "I hear that - reclaiming your ability to really be there with them is what matters most right now.\n\nFor intention 2, let's work with your version. How about: \"I will learn to be present with my family again, without the war getting in the way. I'll show up for Amanda and the kids the way they deserve.\"\n\nHow does that feel? Does it capture what you're seeking?",
  "system9": "Yeah. That's it. Simple. Direct. \n\nI will learn to be present with my family again, without the war getting in the way. I'll show up for Amanda and the kids the way they deserve.\n\n[pauses]\n\nI need to write this down. Keep it with me. Maybe... maybe I'll put it in my wallet where I keep that picture of us from before I deployed. Back when everything was simpler.\n\nThese other two... I guess I need to think about them more. But this one... this one's enough to start with.",
  "user9": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I will learn to be present with my family again, without the war getting in the way. I'll show up for Amanda and the kids the way they deserve.\"\n\nThat's perfect - keeping it with that photo creates a powerful connection between who you were before and who you're becoming. A tangible reminder of what you're fighting for.\n\nBut we typically work with 3 intentions for a journey - having three clear, focused ones gives you something solid to hold onto without getting overwhelmed. You mentioned needing to think about the others - would you like to work through them now, or would you rather sit with this one first and come back to the remaining intentions?",
  "system10": "Let's get it done. I don't want to drag this out - I've got three weeks and then I'm doing this thing. Better to have everything locked in now.\n\n[pause]\n\nThe first one though... about releasing the war without losing strength. I need to be careful how we say that. I can't have it sounding like I'm asking to become some pushover. I just want to be able to sleep without seeing those missions. To not jump when a truck backfires.\n\nHow about: \"I'll face what's haunting me at night so I can be at peace, without losing who I am.\"\n\nAnd the third one... that shame thing. I don't know. Maybe: \"I'll accept help without feeling broken. I'll do what it takes to save my family.\"\n\nThat work?",
  "user10": "I hear you on both - wanting to face the nightmares without losing your core self, and accepting help without the shame of feeling broken.\n\nFor intention 1: \"I'll face what's haunting me at night so I can be at peace, without losing who I am\" - that captures it well. You're not asking to become someone different, just to stop being haunted.\n\nFor intention 3: \"I'll accept help without feeling broken. I'll do what it takes to save my family\" - I notice you added that last part about \"save my family.\" That's powerful language. Is that what this feels like to you - that you're fighting to save them from what war has done to all of you?\n\nHow do these feel as your final three intentions?",
  "system11": "Yeah. That's what it feels like. If I keep going like this... angry, not sleeping, pulling away from them... I'm going to lose everything I came home to. Everything I fought for over there.\n\nAmanda's already looking at me different. The kids walk on eggshells sometimes. I see it. I feel it. I built this life - good business, nice house, stable family. And I'm watching myself tear it down piece by piece without knowing how to stop.\n\nSo yeah. I need to save them from this version of me. Before there's nothing left to save.\n\nThe three intentions - they're good. Let's lock them in.",
  "user11": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I'll face what's haunting me at night so I can be at peace, without losing who I am.\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I will learn to be present with my family again, without the war getting in the way. I'll show up for Amanda and the kids the way they deserve.\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I'll accept help without feeling broken. I'll do what it takes to save my family.\"\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I'll face what's haunting me at night so I can be at peace, without losing who I am.\n2. I will learn to be present with my family again, without the war getting in the way. I'll show up for Amanda and the kids the way they deserve.\n3. I'll accept help without feeling broken. I'll do what it takes to save my family.\n\nYour chosen ritual: Keeping them with that photo of you all from before deployment - a reminder of what you're fighting for now.\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nYou've got three weeks to carry these with you. Three weeks of being the man who's willing to do whatever it takes to save his family - even if it means asking for help. That's real strength.",
  "system12": "[long pause]\n\nThree weeks. Then I go do this thing and see what this plant medicine shows me.\n\nI need to tell Amanda about these. Not all the details maybe, but... she needs to know I'm doing this for us. For her. For the kids. She needs to know I haven't given up.\n\nThanks for helping me get this straight. I feel... I don't know. Like maybe there's a path through this after all.\n\nTime to get to work.",
  "user12": "She needs to know you haven't given up - and now you've got something concrete to show her what you're fighting for.\n\nThree weeks to carry these intentions, then you'll see what the medicine reveals. You've done the hardest part already - choosing to face this instead of letting it destroy everything you built.\n\nTake care of yourself as you get ready. And remember - accepting help isn't weakness, it's how you save what matters most.\n\nWishing you strength and clarity on this journey.",
  "system13": "I will. Thanks. \n\n[long pause]\n\nI'm going to need all the strength I can get for this. But at least now I know what I'm fighting for - and that I don't have to fight alone.",
  "user13": "Exactly. You know what you're fighting for, and you've got three powerful intentions to carry with you.\n\nYou've got this - not alone, not anymore. Take it one day at a time over these next three weeks. The medicine will meet you where you are.\n\nBe well, and trust the process.",
  "system14": "One day at a time. I can do that.\n\nThanks for walking me through this. I'll be ready when the time comes.",
  "user14": "You will be. One day, one intention, one breath at a time.\n\nTake care of yourself. You know where to find these intentions when you need them.",
  "system15": "Yeah. I do.\n\n[long pause]\n\nTime to go home to my family.",
  "user15": "Go home to them. That's where this journey really begins.",
  "system16": "It already has.",
  "user16": "It already has. And you're showing up for it - that's everything.",
  "system17": "Yeah. \n\nI am.",
  "user17": "Then you're already further along than you think.",
  "system18": "Maybe. We\u2019ll see.",
  "user18": "We will. And you\u2019ll have those three intentions in your back pocket when you need them.",
  "system19": "Yup. Right there with my wallet and my keys\u2014everywhere I go.",
  "user19": "Perfect. They\u2019ll travel light and steady with you\u2014just like everything else you can\u2019t leave behind."
