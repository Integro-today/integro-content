  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I don't know. I keep thinking about my grandmother, how she used to light candles every Friday and somehow made the ordinary feel sacred. I've built companies, sold one for more money than I'll ever need, but I can't shake this feeling that I've been climbing the wrong mountain. My kids are growing up so fast and I'm physically there but... not really *there*, you know? I want this to matter. Not just another experience I check off my list.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Making ordinary moments feel sacred again like your grandmother did\n2. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere  \n3. Living the insights instead of just collecting experiences\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are exactly the threads I keep coming back to, but I haven't figured out how to weave them together. It's like... I know all the right things to say about being present and finding meaning, but I'm still operating in that same achievement mode. Even with my spiritual practices\u2014I'm either meditating perfectly or not at all. There's no middle ground.\n\nI want to believe there's a way to bring that sacredness into the everyday chaos. Right now it feels like I have my retreat self and my real life self, and they barely know each other.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I weave sacred moments into ordinary chaos\n2. I show up present with my kids without needing to achieve anything\n3. I live as one integrated self across retreat and daily life\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me in the chest. \"I show up present with my kids without needing to achieve anything.\" That's it. That's the wound. Even when I'm with them, I'm thinking about being a good mom, making memories, teaching lessons... it's like I can't just *be* with them without some hidden agenda.\n\nThe third one too - \"I live as one integrated self\" - that phrase gives me this weird mix of hope and terror. What if my integrated self isn't who I think she is? What if she's not impressive or successful or... god, what if she's boring?\n\nCan we make that second one stronger somehow? It's like I need something to cut through all this performance I've built around motherhood too.",
  "system3": "\"I drop the performance and just *be* with my kids.\"\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "\"Drop the performance\" - yes, that's it exactly. Even saying it feels like relief and panic at the same time.\n\nThe first one... \"I weave sacred moments into ordinary chaos\" - it's beautiful but it feels too polished for me. Like something I'd put on a vision board and never actually do. My chaos isn't poetic, it's emails during dinner and yelling about homework and falling asleep during movie night.\n\nThe third one about integration - I think that's what I'm most afraid of. What if I live as one integrated self and discover I've been living someone else's life this whole time? What if the real Ellen isn't who I've spent forty years becoming?",
  "system4": "How about:\n\n1. I find sacred moments in the mess of dinner emails and homework battles\n2. I drop the performance and just *be* with my kids\n3. I discover who I am beyond who I've built\n\nThese feel more grounded?",
  "user4": "Yes. These feel like they could actually happen in my real life, not just in some idealized version of it. The first one especially - \"in the mess of dinner emails and homework battles\" - that's my actual Tuesday night, not some Instagram version of spiritual motherhood.\n\nThe third one terrifies me in the best way. \"I discover who I am beyond who I've built\" - it's like standing at the edge of a cliff I've spent my whole life climbing, and now I have to jump without knowing what's below.\n\nThese three... they're mine. They're not pretty, but they're honest.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I find sacred moments in the mess of dinner emails and homework battles\n2. I drop the performance and just *be* with my kids  \n3. I discover who I am beyond who I've built\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years, might as well fill it with something that actually matters. \n\nThank you. I don't know what's going to happen in Cancun, but at least now I have something real to hold onto when everything else falls away.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. The medicine works with what's real - you've got that covered now.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "I hope so. I've gotten really good at making things that aren't real look convincing. Maybe it's time to stop performing and start... whatever comes next.",
  "system7": "You've done enough performing. Time to see what's underneath.\n\nThe intentions will hold when you forget them. Trust that.",
  "user7": "I want to believe that. That there's something underneath all this that won't dissolve when I stop trying so hard. Something that can hold my kids, my real self, maybe even my grandmother's faith that I've been running from.\n\nI guess we'll find out.",
  "system8": "You will. The medicine will show you what's been holding you all along.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user8": "I don't feel ready. But maybe that's the point\u2014maybe ready is just another performance I've been perfecting. \n\nI'll see what's there when there's nothing left to prove.",
  "system9": "Exactly. Ready was never the requirement - showing up as you are is.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user9": "Yeah. See you there.",
  "system10": "* nods *\n\nGo well.",
  "user10": "Thanks. I'll... yeah. Just go.",
  "system11": "*quiet nod*\n\nGo.",
  "user11": "I'm scared. But I'm going.",
  "system12": "Good. Fear means you're stepping into real.\n\nGo.",
  "user12": "Okay. I'm going.",
  "system13": "*steady presence*\n\nGo.",
  "user13": "I keep thinking about my grandmother's candlesticks\u2014how she lit them every Friday like the world might end if she missed a week. I never understood that kind of faith. Always seemed like... performance. But maybe she was holding something I can't see yet.\n\nI'm going to find out what she knew.",
  "system14": "Go find out.",
  "user14": "I'm going.",
  "system15": "Go.",
  "user15": "I\u2019m walking in now.",
  "system16": "Walk steady.",
  "user16": "My chest feels like it's cracking open and I'm terrified I'll find nothing there. Just more... empty achievement. But I keep hearing my grandmother's voice saying \"the breaking is where the light gets in.\" I never believed her. \n\nI'm walking toward whatever's waiting.",
  "system17": "Walk toward it.",
  "user17": "I am.",
  "system18": "Good.",
  "user18": "I want to come back different. Not the woman who checks every box but still feels hollow. I want to know what my grandmother knew when she lit those candles. Want to feel something real that lasts longer than the retreat high.",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Feel something real that lasts beyond retreat\n2. Know what your grandmother knew about faith\n3. Replace hollow achievement with lasting presence\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "Yeah. Those three... they're exactly it. \n\nBut how do I make them real? Not just pretty words I write down and then forget when I'm back in my kitchen at 5:30am, scrolling through emails while the kids eat cereal and I pretend I'm present.\n\nI want to feel something real\u2014like how I felt at Soltara when those women came to me. But I don't want to need ayahuasca to remember how to feel. I want to know what my grandmother knew without having to die first. And I want to stop performing this version of myself that's so... exhausting.\n\nHow do I turn that into something I can actually hold onto?"
