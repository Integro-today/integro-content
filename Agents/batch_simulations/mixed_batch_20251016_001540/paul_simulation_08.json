  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts says I need to do this intention thing before the ceremony. I've got three weeks before I head down to Costa Rica.\n\nLook, I don't have PTSD or anything like that. Just... I need to sleep through the night. That's all. My wife Amanda says I wake up shouting sometimes and it scares her. I can't keep doing that to her.\n\nI don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff, but those guys at Heroic Hearts seem solid. If this is what it takes to fix things at home, then I'm here.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda feeling safe in her own bed again  \n3. Fix what's broken at home\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that about sums it up. I need to stop waking up like that, scaring Amanda half to death. She's been sleeping in the guest room more nights than not, and I can't blame her.\n\nI guess the main thing is... I want to be the man she married again. Not whatever this is now.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully beside Amanda through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe in our bed again\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - Amanda feels safe in our bed again. That's what matters most. I hate that she has to check if I'm having a bad night before she comes to bed. She's been tiptoeing around me like I'm some kind of... I don't know.\n\nI want her to feel safe. Like she used to.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: Amanda feels safe in our bed again\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "They're good. I mean, they all feel connected, you know? If Amanda feels safe again, then I'm probably sleeping better. And if I'm sleeping better... maybe I can be the husband she deserves.\n\nBut yeah. Let's keep them as they are.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully beside Amanda through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe in our bed again  \n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for twenty years, ever since basic training. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I appreciate you helping me get this sorted out.",
  "system5": "Good plan. Your wallet's carried you through a lot - let it carry these too.\n\nYou're ready for what's ahead.",
  "user5": "Yeah. We'll see what happens down there in Costa Rica. Just... don't tell the guys at the VFW I wrote down feelings in my wallet, alright? They'd never let me hear the end of it.\n\nBut I'm doing this for Amanda. That's what matters.",
  "system6": "Your secret's safe. Doing this for Amanda - that's solid motivation. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "Appreciate it. Just... ready to get this over with, I guess. Three weeks and I'll be down there drinking some plant stuff I can't even pronounce. \n\nBut if it helps Amanda sleep better at night, it's worth whatever weirdness comes with it.",
  "system7": "That's the right focus. The weirdness passes. What you bring back for Amanda lasts.\n\nThree weeks will be here before you know it.",
  "user7": "Yeah. Three weeks. Been through longer waits than that, I suppose. Just ready to move forward, whatever this looks like.\n\nThanks again for helping me figure this out.",
  "system8": "You've got this. The intentions are set - let them do their work.\n\nTake care of yourself these next three weeks.",
  "user8": "Will do. Just gonna stick to the routine, I guess. Early runs, office, family dinner. Same as always.\n\nBut maybe I'll actually get some sleep before I go. That'd be something.",
  "system9": "Sleep's a good start. Keep the routine steady - it's carried you this far.\n\nSee what happens when you let these intentions work alongside it.",
  "user9": "Yeah. Maybe I'll actually get a full night's rest for once. Been a while since that happened.\n\nWe'll see. Night.",
  "system10": "Night. Let those intentions ride with you into sleep.",
  "user10": "Yeah. Gonna try that. Night.",
  "system11": "Rest easy.",

  "user18": "Look, Heroic Hearts says this might help me stop\u2014whatever's been happening. Nightmares, mostly. Amanda's worried. Says I wake up shouting sometimes. I don't remember that part.\n\nI guess I'm here because I can't lose her. But I don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff. Just... running out of options.",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without the nightmares\n2. Amanda sleeping easy again\n3. Keeping what matters most\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "Yeah. That's... yeah.\n\nI need to sleep through the night without seeing those damn mountains again. Without hearing\u2014without remembering things I thought I'd buried. Amanda needs to stop worrying when she hears me thrashing around at 3 AM.\n\nAnd I need to figure out how to do all that without becoming someone I don't recognize. Someone weak."
