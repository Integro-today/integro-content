  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with my... sleep issues. Amanda's been on me about it for months now. Guess I'm finally here because I can't keep waking up the whole damn house every night.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking the house\n2. Stop the nightmares that have Amanda worried\n3. Find peace so everyone can rest\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I don't know about all this intention stuff. Just... I need the dreams to stop. Need to stop scaring my wife when I wake up shouting. Need to figure out how to shut it off when I'm supposed to be home safe.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I stop scaring Amanda when I wake up\n3. I feel safe in my own home\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one that gets me\u2014Amanda jumping when I bolt upright yelling about things she can't see. She's tough but I see it in her eyes now, that look like she doesn't know who she's sleeping next to.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I stop scaring Amanda when I wake up\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "They land fine I guess. Just... the first one feels too soft. \"Peacefully.\" That's not how I talk. And the third one\u2014of course I feel safe at home. It's everyone else who doesn't.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I stop scaring Amanda when I wake up\n3. Everyone feels safe in our home again\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user4": "The third one\u2014that's it. That's what I need. Not just me being less of a problem, but... everyone feeling normal again. Like we used to before I started turning the house into a damn war zone every night.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: Everyone feels safe in our home again\n\nHow about intention 1 - want to keep \"I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\" or adjust that one too?",
  "user5": "Yeah, that works. Straight to the point. No flowery crap about peaceful sleep\u2014just need to stop the screaming.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I stop scaring Amanda when I wake up\n3. Everyone feels safe in our home again\n\nKeep them in your wallet or tape them by your bed.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Got it. I'll keep them close. Thanks for walking through this with me.",
  "system7": "You're welcome. You've got solid intentions - trust them to guide you.\n\nThe medicine will work with what you've set.",
  "user7": "I hear you. Just... hard to trust something I can't see coming. But I said I'd do this, so I'm doing it.",
  "system8": "That's enough. Showing up is what counts - the trust part comes as you go.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Showing up's what I do. Always have.",
  "system9": "That'll carry you through.",
  "user9": "Appreciate it. Three weeks and I find out if I'm right about that.",
  "system10": "Three weeks. You'll have what you need when you get there.",
  "user10": "Copy that.",
  "system11": "Solid.",
  "user11": "Yeah. Solid.",
