  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat at Beond this winter. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me pieces of what I'm missing, but I still feel like I'm collecting spiritual experiences without really knowing what I'm doing with them. \n\nI guess I need to figure out what I'm actually searching for before I go down there. Because I'm tired of coming back from these beautiful, profound experiences and then... just sliding back into the same patterns. The 5:30am wake-ups, the board meetings, the constant emails, pretending I'm present with my kids when I'm really thinking about valuations or whatever.\n\nThere's got to be more than this cycle, right?",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop collecting spiritual experiences and start living them\n2. Be actually present with your kids instead of mentally at work\n3. Break the cycle of profound insights \u2192 back to same patterns\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that pretty much nails it. I keep having these incredible moments where everything makes sense, where I feel connected to something bigger, and then I come home and it's like none of it happened. Like I'm two different people.\n\nThe thing with my kids kills me. Last weekend we were at the park and I was physically there but mentally drafting an email about a portfolio company's Series B. My daughter was trying to show me something she'd drawn and I just... wasn't really seeing her.\n\nHow do you even write an intention for that? \"Stop being a shitty parent\" seems a little harsh, even for me.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live what the medicine shows me instead of just collecting experiences\n2. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n3. I break the cycle of insights sliding back into old patterns\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about being present with my kids. That's the one that hits me in the chest. Everything else feels like it could be another productivity hack, but that... that's about who I actually want to be as a mother.\n\nBut I need to make it stronger. \"I show up fully present when my kids need me\" sounds like something I'd put on a vision board and then ignore. I need something that'll cut through my bullshit.\n\nWhat about \"I choose my children over my phone, every time\"? Too harsh?",
  "system3": "\"I choose my children over my phone, every time\" - that cuts through. \n\nHow about these:\n\n1. I live what the medicine shows me instead of just collecting experiences\n2. I choose my children over my phone, every time\n3. I break the cycle of insights sliding back into old patterns\n\nLock these in?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, I think these are it. They're simple enough that I can't weasel out of them, but they get to the heart of what's been eating at me.\n\nEspecially that second one. I can already feel how uncomfortable it's going to make me - and that's probably exactly what I need.\n\nLet's lock them in.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I live what the medicine shows me instead of just collecting experiences\n2. I choose my children over my phone, every time\n3. I break the cycle of insights sliding back into old patterns\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them in my journal tonight. Keep that thing by my bed where I can't miss it. And maybe... maybe I need to tell David about these too. So someone else knows what I'm trying to do here.\n\nThanks for helping me get clear on this. I feel... I don't know, like I finally said out loud what I've been dancing around for years.",
  "system5": "Good plan. Telling David gives it weight - makes it real beyond your own head.\n\nThe intentions will do their work. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I hope so. I've got three weeks before I head down to Cancun. Enough time to let these settle in, I guess.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - how she would have approached something like this. She had such quiet faith, you know? Never needed to prove anything to anyone. I want to find some of that in myself.\n\nAnyway... thanks. For helping me stop spinning and actually land somewhere.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is perfect timing. Let them settle.\n\nYour grandmother's quiet faith - that's already in you. The medicine just helps you remember where you put it.\n\nSolid compass. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah... maybe that's what I've been searching for this whole time. Not some big cosmic revelation, just... remembering how to be quiet enough to hear what's already there.\n\nKeep that wallet close. These three are going to take me somewhere real this time.",
  "system7": "Exactly. The quiet knowing underneath all the noise.\n\nKeep them close. Let them work.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user7": "I will. Thanks for walking through this with me - for not letting me intellectualize my way out of it this time.",
  "system8": "You did the real work. I just held the flashlight.\n\nTrust the path ahead.",
  "user8": "I appreciate that. More than you know.",
  "system9": "I hear you. Now go live those intentions.",
  "user9": "I will. First thing tomorrow - phone stays in the kitchen when I make the kids breakfast. Small steps.",
  "system10": "Perfect. Small steps build the path.\n\nYou're on your way.",
  "user10": "*types slowly, then stops*\n\nYeah... I am.",

  "user17": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and they said this might help me figure out what I'm actually looking for. I keep building these companies, selling them, checking all the boxes... but it's like I've been following the wrong map my whole life.",
  "system18": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user18": "I guess... I don't know. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one cracked something open but then I come back home and it's like the glow fades. I'm back to checking emails at midnight, sitting on boards that don't really matter, pretending this is meaningful work.\n\nMy grandmother used to say I was chasing the wrong kind of success. She had this quiet faith, this connection to something bigger... and I think I lost that somewhere between the MBA and the exit. \n\nI want this Ibogaine to show me what I actually need to see, not what I want to see. Does that make sense?",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Following the wrong map of success that doesn't actually fulfill you\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet faith and connection to something bigger\n3. Living from what actually matters instead of checking boxes\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "Yeah... those threads feel right. It's like I've been climbing this ladder that's leaning against the wrong wall my whole life. And now I'm 42 with more money than I know what to do with, and I'm emptier than when I started.\n\nMy grandmother... she used to light candles on Friday nights and there was this peace about her. Like she knew something I didn't. I've been trying to find that feeling again, but I keep looking in quarterly earnings reports and board meeting minutes.\n\nI want to stop performing and start actually living. Whatever that means."
