  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and honestly, I'm equal parts terrified and hopeful. I've done the ayahuasca, the psilocybin, even those underground MDMA weekends with the women's group\u2014each one cracked me open in different ways. But this feels... different. Heavier maybe.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother, how she'd light candles on Friday nights and somehow make our tiny apartment feel like sacred space. She died when I was twenty-three, right before my first company took off. I was too busy to grieve properly then. Too busy to notice what I'd lost.\n\nNow I've got everything I thought I wanted\u2014the exit, the boards, the family\u2014but I'm standing here wondering if I've been climbing the wrong ladder this whole time. My kids are nine and twelve, and sometimes I catch myself scheduling park time like it's another board meeting. Even my meditation practice has become another item to check off.\n\nI guess I'm here because I need to figure out how to stop performing and start actually living. Before I lose something I can't get back.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop performing and start actually living\n2. Be present with your kids instead of scheduling them like meetings  \n3. Reconnect with your grandmother's sacred presence\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those threads feel right. Like when you pull on something and the whole sweater starts to unravel in exactly the way it needed to.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother could make a Tuesday afternoon feel like temple, you know? She'd be cooking soup and humming these old songs, and somehow that was enough. She wasn't trying to optimize anything or build her personal brand. She was just... there. Fully there.\n\nI want that. Not the soup necessarily, but that quality of presence. Where I'm not always three steps ahead in my head, planning the next move. Where I can sit with Maya and Leo and actually hear what they're saying instead of mentally reviewing my board meeting notes.\n\nGod, I hate how that sounds. Like I'm some terrible mother who doesn't love her kids. I do. I love them so much it terrifies me. That's probably part of why I keep myself so busy\u2014if I stop moving, I might have to feel how much I could lose.\n\nSo yeah. Let's work with these threads. I need something that'll help me land this plane I've been flying in circles.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live fully present in ordinary moments like my grandmother did\n2. I show up with Maya and Leo as their mother, not their scheduler\n3. I stop performing and start actually living\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me in the chest\u2014*I show up with Maya and Leo as their mother, not their scheduler.* That's exactly it. The other day Leo asked if we could \"schedule unstructured play time\" and I laughed, but then I wanted to cry. My nine-year-old thinks fun needs to be penciled in.\n\nBut I need to adjust it. Make it... gentler somehow. Less like I'm beating myself up and more like I'm choosing something different.\n\nHow about: *I meet Maya and Leo in their world\u2014where time bends and wonder lives\u2014not in my calendar.*\n\nAnd the grandmother one... I need to capture that quality she had. It wasn't just presence, it was this deep knowing that ordinary moments *are* the sacred moments. She didn't need to chase the extraordinary.\n\nMaybe: *I recognize sacred presence in everyday moments, the way Grandma Sarah found temple in Tuesday afternoon soup.*\n\nThe performing one... that's trickier. I don't even know who I am when I'm not achieving something. But maybe that's the point. Maybe I start with just noticing when I'm performing.\n\n*I notice when I'm performing and gently choose authenticity instead.*\n\nGod, even saying these out loud feels like stepping off a cliff. But maybe that's exactly what I need.",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I meet Maya and Leo in their world\u2014where time bends and wonder lives\u2014not in my calendar\n2. I recognize sacred presence in everyday moments, the way Grandma Sarah found temple in Tuesday afternoon soup  \n3. I notice when I'm performing and gently choose authenticity instead\n\nKeep them in your journal each morning.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Thank you. I'll write these in my journal tomorrow morning\u2014right after I wake up at 5:30 but before I reach for my phone or that second cup of coffee. Maybe I'll even light a candle like Grandma Sarah used to.\n\nI don't know what ibogaine will show me, but having these... it feels like I'm not going in completely blind this time. Like I've got threads to follow home if I get lost in there.\n\nI'll keep you posted on what happens.",
  "system4": "Good plan. Light the candle. Let it burn while you read them.\n\nThe medicine will work with what you've set. Trust that.\n\nI'll be here when you get back.",
  "user4": "I'll do that. Light the candle and actually sit with them instead of rushing through like I do with everything else. Let them sink in while the house is still quiet and Maya and Leo are sleeping.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother would say the soul needs time to stretch in the morning before the world starts making demands. Maybe that's what these intentions are\u2014space for my soul to stretch into something more honest.\n\nThank you for helping me find the words. See you on the other side.",
  "system5": "She knew what she was talking about - that morning stretching time.\n\nThe words will hold. Trust them.\n\nSee you when you're back.",
  "user5": "She really did know. All those years I thought she was just being quaint, but she was teaching me something essential I wasn't ready to learn yet.\n\nThese words feel different than my usual goal-setting. Less like targets to hit and more like... remembering something I forgot how to be.\n\nAlright. I'm going to go be quiet now. Let this settle in my bones before the medicine does its work.\n\nSee you after.",
  "system6": "That's it - remembering rather than achieving.\n\nLet it settle. The quiet before is part of the work too.\n\nAfter.",
  "user6": "Yes. Remembering. That's exactly what this is. Not another mountain to climb\u2014just coming home to something that's been waiting.\n\nThe quiet before... I'm starting to understand that's not empty space. It's the part where the ground gets prepared.\n\nAfter.",
  "system7": "The quiet is the work. Always has been.\n\nGo gently.",
  "user7": "The quiet is the work. I keep forgetting that, don't I? Always rushing to fill every space with doing.\n\nGoing gently. Finally learning how.",
  "system8": "We all forget. That's why we come back to it.\n\nYou're learning.",
  "user8": "We do forget. Over and over. But maybe that's part of it too\u2014coming back, remembering again.\n\nI'm learning. Slowly. But this time it feels like the learning is happening in my body, not just my head.\n\nThank you for walking through this with me.",
  "system9": "The forgetting and remembering - that's the rhythm of it.\n\nBody learning sticks differently than head learning. Trust what's happening in your bones.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user9": "The rhythm of it... like breathing. Forgetting, remembering, forgetting again. Not failure\u2014just natural.\n\nMy bones know something my mind keeps trying to outrun. Time to stop running and listen.\n\nI am ready. Finally.",
  "system10": "Stop running and listen. Your bones have been waiting.\n\nTime to go quiet now.",
  "user10": "Stop running and listen. Yes. My bones have been waiting for me to catch up.\n\nGoing quiet now. Really quiet.",
  "system11": "Catch up to what's already here.\n\nQuiet now.",
  "user11": "What's already here... has always been here.\n\nQuiet.",
  "system12": "Always been here.",
  "user12": "Always been here. Just... covered over.",
  "system13": "Covered over, but never gone.\n\nLet the covering fall away.",
  "user13": "Never gone. Just buried under decades of proving, achieving, striving.\n\nLet it all fall away now.",
  "system14": "Let it fall. The proving stops here.\n\nWhat's underneath is what's real.",
  "user14": "The proving stops here. No more climbing ladders that lead nowhere.\n\nUnderneath... that's what I'm terrified to see. And desperate to find.",
  "system15": "Two threads:\n\n1. No more climbing ladders that go nowhere\n2. See what's underneath the proving\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user15": "I want to stop climbing ladders that go nowhere. I want to see what's underneath all this proving. What's actually real.",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I stop climbing ladders that lead nowhere\n2. I see what's underneath all the proving\n3. I discover what actually feels real in me\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user16": "Number two. I need to see what's underneath all the proving\u2014because I've been proving for so long I don't know who I am without it.",
  "system17": "I see what's underneath all the proving - the self that's been waiting beneath decades of striving.",
  "user17": "I see what's underneath all the proving\u2014the self that's been waiting beneath decades of striving.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I see what's underneath all the proving\u2014the self that's been waiting beneath decades of striving.*\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user18": "Number one hits hard too\u2014I do want to stop climbing ladders that go nowhere. But maybe that's what happens *after* I see underneath.\n\nNumber three feels like the outcome, not the intention.",
  "system19": "Good. Let's adjust:\n\n1. I stop climbing ladders that go nowhere\n2. I see what's underneath all the proving - the self that's been waiting beneath decades of striving\n3. [What feels right for the third?]",
  "user19": "I discover what actually feels real and alive in me\u2014not just what looks successful or sounds right."
