  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I have an ibogaine ceremony coming up at Beond this winter, and I need this to be different. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each time I get these incredible insights about connection and meaning, then I come home and within weeks I'm back to the same patterns. Checking email during dinner, saying yes to every board meeting, chasing the next thing.\n\nI'm tired of collecting spiritual experiences like achievements. I want to actually live differently this time.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Living insights instead of collecting them\n2. Being present instead of checking out\n3. Saying no to busy-ness, yes to what matters\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three things. That's it exactly.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that showed up in how she lived, not what she talked about. She'd make these simple meals, tend her garden, help neighbors. Nothing flashy, but everything mattered. I want that kind of presence.\n\nAnd my kids... they're 9 and 12 now. When was the last time I just sat with them without my phone? Really sat with them? I want to know who they are becoming before they're gone.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live what the medicine shows me instead of collecting insights\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet presence in daily moments\n3. I show up fully with my kids without distraction\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I live what the medicine shows me instead of collecting insights\" - that hits hard. I feel that one in my chest.\n\nBut... I don't know, maybe it's too broad? I need something that'll actually stop me when I'm reaching for my phone during dinner, you know? Something concrete.\n\nMaybe... \"I stop performing spirituality and start practicing it, one choice at a time.\" Is that too wordy? I want it strong enough to cut through my BS.",
  "system3": "\"I stop performing spirituality and start practicing it, one choice at a time.\"\n\nThat's strong. It'll cut through.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The second one about my grandmother... I want it to be more raw. Less poetic. She wasn't about being present - she was just *there*. Fully there. No phone, no distractions, no performance. Just her and whatever was happening.\n\nMaybe something like \"I put down my phone and show up like my grandmother did - completely, no matter how ordinary the moment.\"\n\nAnd the kids one... God, that one hurts. My daughter asked me last week why I'm always \"busy thinking.\" I want to be able to say \"I'm here now\" and mean it. \"I give my children the gift of my full attention - not what's left over after email.\"",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I stop performing spirituality and start practicing it, one choice at a time\n2. I put down my phone and show up like my grandmother did - completely, no matter how ordinary the moment\n3. I give my children the gift of my full attention - not what's left over after email\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down and keep them where I can see them every day. This feels different than before - more grounded, less... aspirational? Like I can actually do these things, not just dream about them.\n\nI want to read them to my husband tonight. Maybe even ask him to hold me accountable, though I'm not sure how that conversation will go. He's been patient with all my spiritual searching, but I think he's waiting to see if any of it actually changes how I show up at home.\n\nI guess that's the real test, isn't it? Not what happens in ceremony, but what happens at 6:30pm when we're clearing dishes and the kids are arguing about homework.",
  "system5": "That's exactly where the work happens - 6:30pm with dishes and homework battles.\n\nCeremonies open doors. You walk through them in ordinary moments.\n\nTrust these intentions when things get messy. They'll hold.",
  "user5": "Yeah... the messy moments. That's where I always forget everything and go into achievement mode. Like if I can just solve this homework crisis or get everyone to calm down, I've won something.\n\nBut maybe that's exactly when I need to remember these. When Maya's melting down about her math worksheet and Leo's asking me a question and my phone's buzzing with some board emergency... that's when I need to just stop and be here.\n\nGod, I'm already anxious thinking about it. But also... kind of excited? Like maybe this is how I finally stop collecting and start living.",
  "system6": "That anxiety-excitement mix? That's the edge where change happens.\n\nWhen everything falls apart at 6:30pm, pause for three seconds. Read intention #1. Let the rest wait.\n\nThree seconds is enough to shift from solving to being.",
  "user6": "Three seconds... I can do three seconds. That's actually genius - small enough that I can't fail, but big enough to break the automatic pilot.\n\nI'm going to practice it right now while I'm thinking about it. Three seconds to notice when I'm about to jump into fix-it mode. Three seconds to remember I don't have to perform being a good mom - I just have to be here.\n\nMy chest feels tight thinking about it, but also... lighter? Like maybe I've been carrying this weight of having to do everything perfectly and I can just... set it down.\n\nThree seconds. Okay.",
  "system7": "Three seconds to set down the weight of perfect.\n\nThe tight chest is your body learning a new way. Let it learn.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "Yeah... I feel that. My body learning something new. It's like when I first started doing yoga - everything felt foreign and wrong until one day it didn't.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother and how she never seemed rushed. Even when things were chaotic, she moved through it like she had all the time in the world. Maybe that's what I'm really after - not just being present, but having that kind of... unhurried presence?\n\nI don't know. But I'm going to try. Three seconds at a time.",
  "system8": "Unhurried presence - that's it exactly.\n\nYour grandmother knew something about time that clocks don't measure.\n\nThree seconds will teach you what she knew.",
  "user8": "She really did know something about time... I remember her stirring soup and it was like she was conducting a symphony, not just making dinner. Everything had this rhythm to it.\n\nI want to learn that rhythm. Not the startup pace I've been running at for twenty years, but something deeper. Something that knows dinner with family matters more than any board meeting.\n\nThree seconds. My grandmother's time. I think I'm starting to understand.",
  "system9": "That's the rhythm - conducting dinner like a symphony instead of a startup pitch.\n\nThree seconds will stretch into that deeper time. Let it.",
  "user9": "Yeah... let it stretch. I keep wanting to rush this transformation like it's another company to scale, but maybe that's exactly what I need to unlearn.\n\nThree seconds to feel the difference between conducting and pitching. Between being and performing.\n\nThank you for helping me find words for what I've been chasing. I think I'm finally ready to stop running and start... arriving.",
  "system10": "Arriving instead of scaling. That's the shift.\n\nKeep those intentions close. They'll remind you when you forget.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user10": "Arriving... yeah. That's exactly it. Not another mountain to climb, just... being here.\n\nI'll keep them close. In my wallet, on my phone, everywhere. So when I forget - and I will - I can find my way back to three seconds.\n\nThank you. Really. I feel... grounded in a way I haven't in years.",
  "system11": "Grounded is good. Trust that feeling.\n\nThree seconds will bring you back when you drift.",
  "user11": "I will. Trusting this feeling... trusting myself. That's new too.\n\nThree seconds. Grounded. I'm ready for whatever comes next.",
  "system12": "Good. You've got what you need.\n\nLet the grounded carry you forward.",
  "user12": "It will. All of it will.\n\nThank you\u2014for helping me find my way back to something real.",
  "system13": "You found your own way back. I just helped you see the path.\n\nTrust what you found.",
  "user13": "I will. I found it, and I\u2019m not letting go this time.",
  "system14": "Hold it. Live it. Let it hold you too.\n\nThe rhythm\u2019s yours now.",
  "user14": "I feel it. Finally, I feel it.",
  "system15": "Let that feeling settle in your bones.",
  "user15": "It\u2019s settling. Deep. Like it belongs there.",
  "system16": "Good. Let it stay.",
  "user16": "I will. I\u2019m not running from it this time.",
  "system17": "Then you're already doing the work.",
  "user17": "Then maybe I\u2019m finally ready to live what I keep saying I believe.",
  "system18": "That\u2019s the line between saying and becoming.",
  "user18": "Yeah\u2026 and I\u2019m walking it now.",
  "system19": "Keep walking.",
  "user19": "One foot in front of the other. Even when the path feels like it\u2019s disappearing under me."
