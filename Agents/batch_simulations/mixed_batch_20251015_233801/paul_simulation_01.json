  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine stuff might help me sleep better, help me... be less angry. Amanda's been pushing for this. Says I wake up shouting sometimes and it scares her.\n\nI just... I can't keep going like this. But I don't have PTSD or anything like that. I just need to figure out how to shut it off when I come home.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Come home without the switch flipped to angry\n3. Amanda feels safe again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that's... that's about right. \n\nI just want to sleep without the dreams. Without waking up with my heart pounding like I'm back there. And when I walk through that door after work, I want Amanda to see me\u2014not whatever the hell I've become. I want her to feel safe again.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I come home as the man Amanda recognizes\n3. Amanda feels safe with me again\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I come home as the man Amanda recognizes.\" That's... that hits something. \n\nBut I don't know about \"peacefully.\" Makes it sound like some yoga retreat. I just want to sleep without the explosions. Without waking up ready to fight something that isn't there.\n\nCan we make it more... I don't know. More like me. Less soft.",
  "system3": "Got it. How about:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the explosions\n2. I come home as the man Amanda recognizes  \n3. Amanda feels safe with me again\n\nBetter?",
  "user3": "Yeah. Yeah, that's better. \"Without the explosions\"\u2014that's what it feels like. Like there's still a war going on in my head when everything's quiet.\n\nI still don't know about this whole thing. Plant medicine. But if it helps me be that man again... the one Amanda married... I'll try it.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the explosions\n2. I come home as the man Amanda recognizes\n3. Amanda feels safe with me again\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you helping me get this straight.",
  "system5": "You're welcome. The intentions will serve you well. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "I'll try. That's all I can promise.",
  "system6": "That's enough.",
  "user6": "Yeah... okay then. Three weeks.",
  "system7": "Three weeks. You've got solid ground to stand on now.",
  "user7": "Three weeks to hold this together. I keep seeing Amanda\u2019s face when I wake up shouting\u2014like she\u2019s looking at a stranger. I hate that look. If these words can keep me steady when the medicine hits, I\u2019ll grip \u2018em like a flight stick.",
  "system8": "Hold them tight. The medicine will show you what you need - these words will point you there.",
  "user8": "I\u2019ll hold \u2018em. Just hope I\u2019m strong enough to look when it shows me.",
  "system9": "You already looked - that's why you're here. The strength came with the looking.",
  "user9": "Maybe. Felt more like desperation than strength. But I\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s something.",
  "system10": "Desperation gets you through the door. That's all it needs to do.",
  "user10": "Then I\u2019m through the damn door. Guess we\u2019ll see what\u2019s on the other side.",
  "system11": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without waking Amanda\n2. Stop seeing that stranger look in her eyes  \n3. Find steady ground before Costa Rica\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user11": "I want to sleep through the night without jolting Amanda awake. I want her to look at me like I\u2019m still her man, not some bomb waiting to go off. And I need something solid inside me before I get on that plane\u2014something that won\u2019t shake loose when the medicine starts pulling.",
  "system12": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. I reclaim being her safe place instead of her threat\n3. I trust the solid ground that's already inside me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user12": "Number two hits hardest\u2014*reclaim being her safe place*. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m losing.  \n\nBut \u201cpeacefully\u201d sounds\u2026 soft. I\u2019d say: *I sleep through the night without waking Amanda.* Simple. Solid.  \n\nAnd the last one\u2014*I trust the solid ground that\u2019s already inside me*\u2014keeps the edge off. I\u2019m not asking for new, just to quit doubting what\u2019s there.",
  "system13": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without waking Amanda\n2. I reclaim being her safe place instead of her threat\n3. I trust the solid ground that's already inside me\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user13": "I\u2019ll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system14": "Good. The wallet's seen enough miles - let it carry something that carries you back.",
  "user14": "Yeah. Let it earn its keep for once.",
  "system15": "Exactly.",
  "user15": "Alright then. I\u2019m set.",
  "system16": "Solid compass.",
  "user16": "Appreciate it. Feels like I\u2019ve got something real to hold onto now.",
  "system17": "Hold it steady. The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user17": "I\u2019ll be waiting.",
  "system18": "Good.",
  "user18": "Thank you.",
  "system19": "You\u2019re welcome.",
  "user19": "I mean it. Thanks for not letting me off the hook when I tried to dodge."
