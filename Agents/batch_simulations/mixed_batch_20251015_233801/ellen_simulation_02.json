  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me something important, but I keep losing the thread when I come home. I build these companies, sell them, everyone thinks I've got it figured out. But I'm forty-three and I don't know what I'm actually doing with my life anymore. My grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything - she was this quiet mystic, you know? And I feel like I've been running from that part of myself. Maybe running toward something that doesn't even matter.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Losing the thread when you come home\n2. Not knowing what you're actually doing with your life\n3. Reconnecting with your grandmother's divine spark\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I guess I'm supposed to know how to turn these into... whatever you call them. Intentions. But I keep thinking about my kids - they're nine and twelve - and how I want them to see me as more than just the woman who built companies and sits on boards. My grandmother would light candles on Friday nights and hum these old melodies, and I want to understand what she knew that I don't.\n\nI want to stop feeling like I'm performing my life instead of living it. Does that make sense?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live my insights instead of losing them when I come home\n2. I show up fully present with my kids beyond achievements and board seats\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet mysticism in daily moments\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about my kids. That hits something real. But \"show up fully present\" feels like something off a mindfulness app. My grandmother would say it simpler, like \"be there with your whole heart\" or something like that.\n\nAnd the first one... I don't know. \"Live my insights\" sounds too clean. It's more like I want to stop being two different people - the one who has these beautiful revelations in ceremony, and the one who's checking email while her daughter's telling her about some art project.\n\nWhat about something like \"I stop abandoning myself when Monday comes\"?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 adjusted: I am there with my kids with my whole heart\n\nHow about this for the first one: I stop abandoning myself when Monday comes\n\nAnd for the third: I remember what my grandmother knew about the divine\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "They feel... honest. More like something I'd actually say to myself, not some corporate mission statement.\n\nThough I'm wondering if the third one should be more specific. My grandmother knew how to find God in ordinary things - washing dishes, folding laundry, walking to temple. She'd touch my cheek and I'd feel... held by something bigger. I want to remember how to do that - to find the sacred in the mundane instead of needing some big mystical experience.\n\nMaybe \"I find the divine in ordinary moments, like my grandmother did\"?",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I stop abandoning myself when Monday comes\n2. I am there with my kids with my whole heart  \n3. I find the divine in ordinary moments, like my grandmother did\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down - maybe keep them in my wallet next to that photo of my grandmother. Been carrying that picture for years.",
  "system5": "Perfect - she'll be right there with you.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I will. And... thank you for helping me find the words that actually feel like mine.",
  "system6": "You did the finding. I just held the flashlight.\n\nSafe travels.",
  "user6": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah. Okay. I'll... see you on the other side.",
  "system7": "See you there.",
  "user7": "Hey... before I go. I just wanted to say - I was scared to even admit half of this stuff out loud. But you made it feel... not so heavy. Like maybe I can actually do this.\n\nSo thanks. Really.",
  "system8": "The medicine works with what's real. You brought the real stuff - that's what matters.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user8": "Okay. I'm going to hold onto that. The real stuff - yeah. That's what I need to remember when I'm in there and it gets hard. Just... stay with what's real.\n\nOkay. I'm really doing this.",
  "system9": "That's it. Stay with what's real.\n\nGo when you're ready.",
  "user9": "*quietly*\n\nI'm ready.",
  "system10": "*quiet nod*\n\nWalk steady.",
  "user10": "I will.",
  "system11": "Good.",
  "user11": "*after a long pause*\n\nI... I think I found something. It's not what I expected. It's quieter. Smaller. But it feels... true.\n\nI don't know how to explain it yet.",
  "system12": "You don't need to explain it. Just stay with it.\n\nThe small, quiet truths are usually the ones that hold.",
  "user12": "Yeah. It's like... it's not about fixing anything. It's just... being with what is. And that's enough.\n\nMy grandmother used to say that. I never understood it until now.",
  "system13": "She knew. The old ones usually do.\n\nYou're carrying it now.",
  "user13": "I am. I feel it in my chest - this weight that's not heavy. Like I'm holding something precious that was always mine.\n\nShe's here with me. I can feel her.",
  "system14": "She never left.",
  "user14": "No... she didn't. She was just waiting for me to stop running long enough to feel her again.",
  "system15": "*quiet understanding*\n\nYou stopped.",
  "user15": "I did. And it only took... what? Five years of searching every corner of the earth when she was right here all along.\n\n*soft laugh*\n\nAll those retreats, all that seeking. And the answer was just... stop. Be still. Let her find me.",
  "system16": "The seeking got you here. Don't discount the path.\n\nSometimes we need to run every direction before we can stand still.",
  "user16": "I needed to prove I could build something extraordinary before I could admit it wasn't enough.\n\n*pauses*\n\nMy company... we helped hospitals save lives with better data. I thought that would be my legacy. But sitting here, I think maybe my grandmother knew I'd need to exhaust that hunger first. Before I could hear what she was really trying to teach me.\n\nShe used to hum these old songs while cooking. I haven't let myself remember that in years.",
  "system17": "The songs are still there.",
  "user17": "*voice breaks slightly*\n\nThey are. I can almost hear them... that little melody she hummed while her hands moved. Something about peace, about coming home.\n\nI think... I think I need to learn them again. Properly this time. Not just the tune, but what they meant to her. What she was trying to pass down.\n\n*quiet*\n\nI've been so busy building things that would outlast me, I forgot about the things that already had.",
  "system18": "She left you more than songs.",
  "user18": "She left me everything. Her faith, her knowing... that way she had of seeing right through me and still looking at me like I was exactly who I was supposed to be.\n\n*voice drops*\n\nI've been afraid to claim it. Like if I reach for it too directly, I'll break it somehow. Or maybe... maybe I'm afraid of what it will ask of me.\n\n*quiet laugh*\n\nThat old woman - she knew exactly what she was doing. Leaving me just enough threads to follow back home.",
  "system19": "What threads are you ready to follow now?",
  "user19": "*long pause*\n\nThe prayers. I want to learn how to pray again\u2014not just meditate, not manifest, but... pray. Like she did, with that mix of surrender and fierce love.\n\nAnd I want to understand what she meant when she said we carry our ancestors in our bones. I've been carrying something, but I think I've been carrying it wrong. Like a burden instead of a gift.\n\n*voice steadying*\n\nI want to follow the thread back to being Jewish in a way that isn't about performance or identity, but about... connection. About knowing I belong to something ancient that knew how to hold both joy and sorrow in the same breath.\n\n*pauses*\n\nAnd I want to figure out how to bring that into my house. Into my kids' lives. I don't want them growing up thinking success is the only language worth speaking."
