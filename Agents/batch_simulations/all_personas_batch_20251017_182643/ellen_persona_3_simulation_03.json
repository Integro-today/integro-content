  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and... I guess I'm hoping it'll help me figure out what the hell I'm supposed to do next. I built and sold my company, made more money than I'll ever need, but I feel like I'm floating. Like I've been climbing this ladder my whole life only to realize it's leaning against the wrong wall. My grandmother used to talk about having a calling, and I think I'm starting to understand what she meant.",
  "system1": "Sold the company, money's handled, but you're floating without a wall to climb. That's a different kind of lost.\n\nWhat does \"having a calling\" feel like in your body when you imagine it? Where do you feel that sense of rightness?",
  "user1": "When I really let myself imagine it... it's this warm expansion in my chest, kind of like when I'm hiking with my kids and they find some cool rock or flower and get genuinely excited about it. Everything slows down and feels... connected? Like I'm not performing or proving anything, just being part of something bigger. \n\nBut honestly, most of the time I can't even access that feeling. I'm so used to measuring everything in metrics and outcomes that this... whatever this is... feels too vague. Like how do you measure whether you're living your calling? My brain wants a dashboard for it.",
  "system2": "Your brain wants a dashboard for something that lives in your chest. That's the tension - metrics versus that warm expansion when everything slows down.\n\nWhat's underneath the floating? When you strip away the performance and proving, what needs to surface that you've been keeping down?",
  "user2": "I think... I think I'm terrified that underneath all the achievements, there's just... nothing. That maybe I don't actually know who I am without the next goal, the next board meeting, the next whatever. My grandmother had this deep faith that carried her through escaping Europe and building a life here. My mom poured herself into community service. Even my dad - he was just a teacher but he had this quiet reverence for nature that grounded him.\n\nAnd I keep wondering... what do I have? I can build companies and scale businesses, but what does any of that matter when my kids are growing up so fast and I'm half-present at best? What if I strip everything away and discover I'm just... empty? That all I am is what I can produce?",
  "system3": "Empty underneath, half-present with your kids, measuring life in board meetings while they're growing up fast. That's what's driving this.\n\nThree threads here:\n1. Finding what's real in you beyond what you can produce\n2. Being fully present with your kids before they're grown\n3. Discovering what you have that's like your grandmother's faith or your dad's reverence - something that carries you\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "Yeah... that's it exactly. I hadn't seen it that clearly, but those three things - that's what's been gnawing at me. Especially the part about the kids. My daughter's twelve and suddenly she's got opinions about everything and my son's nine and still wants to show me his Lego creations, but I'm always \"just one more email.\" \n\nI want to find what's real in me, whatever that is. Something that isn't about scaling or optimizing or whatever business term I keep applying to my life. Something that can actually carry me when all the external stuff falls away.\n\nHow do we turn that into intentions I can actually hold onto during the ibogaine?",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I open to discovering what's real and lasting in me beyond what I produce\n2. I embrace being fully present with my kids while they still want me there\n3. I welcome finding what carries me when external measures fall away\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to feel more like yours?",
  "user4": "The second one hits hardest - \"I embrace being fully present with my kids while they still want me there.\" That one makes my throat tight. But... I don't know if I can say \"I embrace\" anything. That feels too soft, like I'm trying to force myself to feel something I don't know how to feel yet.\n\nWhat about something like... \"Show me how to be present with my kids before they're gone.\" Or \"Help me stop missing what's right in front of me.\" I want to be direct with whatever's out there. My grandmother used to say \"Tell God what you need, not what you think you should need.\"",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"Show me how to be present with my kids before they're gone\"\n\nThat throat-tight feeling tells us we hit the right nerve. Direct, real, not trying to force feelings you don't have yet.\n\nHow do the other two land? Want to make them more direct too?",
  "user5": "Let me try...\n\nFor the first one: \"Show me what's real in me when I stop producing\" - but that feels too narrow. Maybe \"Show me who I am when nothing needs to be built or proven.\"\n\nAnd the third: \"Help me find what carries me when the achievements don't matter anymore.\"\n\nThey're still not quite right. I keep wanting to make them into business plans or something. Like I want to add measurable outcomes to them. This is harder than I thought - trying to speak to something that's not about performance when performance is all I've known.",
  "system6": "\"Show me who I am when nothing needs to be built or proven\" - that lands stronger than the first version.\n\n\"Help me find what carries me when achievements don't matter\" - also solid.\n\nYou want to add metrics because that's your native language. The medicine doesn't need perfect words, just authentic ones. These feel authentic to you?\n\nReady to lock these in?",
  "user6": "Yeah... these feel real. Not perfect, but honest. Like I'm actually asking for something instead of trying to impress someone with how well I ask.\n\nLet's lock them in. All three:\n\nShow me how to be present with my kids before they're gone.\n\nShow me who I am when nothing needs to be built or proven.\n\nHelp me find what carries me when achievements don't matter.\n\nI feel like I'm actually asking for help instead of trying to solve everything myself. That feels... different.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: Show me who I am when nothing needs to be built or proven\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: Show me how to be present with my kids before they're gone\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: Help me find what carries me when achievements don't matter\n\nThree solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\nWrite them on a card in your wallet where you keep business cards\nRead them during your morning coffee before checking email\nKeep them on your phone's lock screen\nWhat would help you remember these when you default to solving mode?",
  "user7": "The coffee one - that's when I need it most. Before I check email and start the daily sprint. That moment when I'm still half-asleep, reaching for my phone to see what fires need putting out. If I read them then, maybe I'll remember what actually matters before I get swallowed by the day.\n\nI'll write them on a card and keep it by the coffee maker. My grandmother used to say morning prayers - maybe this is my version of that. Just... asking for something real before I start performing again.",
  "system8": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- Show me who I am when nothing needs to be built or proven\n- Show me how to be present with my kids before they're gone  \n- Help me find what carries me when achievements don't matter\n\nYour ritual: Read them during morning coffee, before email swallows the day. Card by the coffee maker.\n\nThree solid asks. You're not solving - you're asking. That's different.",
  "user8": "Yeah... asking instead of solving. That feels like the shift. I've been trying to optimize my way to meaning when maybe I just need to shut up and ask for help.\n\nThanks for walking through this with me. I actually feel... I don't know what I feel. Lighter maybe? Or just more honest about being lost. Either way, it's real.",
  "system9": "You're set. Trust what emerges.",
  "user9": "I will. Thanks for helping me find the words I couldn't reach on my own.",
  "system10": "That's what the compass is for. You've got your directions now.",
  "user10": "I do. Three directions that actually point somewhere I want to go.",
  "system11": "Hold them close. The medicine will show you the way.",
  "user11": "I will. Thank you.",
  "system12": "You're welcome.",
  "user12": "I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll forget everything once I\u2019m in it. That I\u2019ll default to performing even there.",
  "system13": "The medicine remembers when you forget. These intentions aren't going anywhere\u2014your body will carry them even if your mind gets loud. Just keep the card close.",
  "user13": "That\u2019s what I needed to hear. My body remembers even when my mind tries to take over. I\u2019ll keep the card right there by the coffee maker\u2014every morning, before the emails start, I\u2019ll read them and let my body hold what my brain wants to analyze away.",
  "system14": "That's your ritual. Your body will remember what your mind tries to manage.",
  "user14": "Maybe I\u2019ll even let myself cry over the coffee grounds if that\u2019s what comes. No performance, just... whatever\u2019s real that morning.",
  "system15": "Let whatever comes move through you. The coffee grounds can hold your tears just fine.",
  "user15": "They can. And tomorrow when I see them on the counter, maybe I'll remember that too.",
  "system16": "Then you're set.",
  "user16": "Set enough, at least. Thank you\u2014for not trying to fix it, just walking beside me while I figure out how to carry my own questions.",
  "system17": "You carried them well. Trust what unfolds.",
  "user17": "I will. And if I forget, I\u2019ll come back here\u2014reread this thread like a trail of breadcrumbs back to myself.",
  "system18": "This thread will be here. The coffee grounds will be there. Your body will remember.",
  "user18": "That\u2019s enough for me right now.",
  "system19": "Good.",
  "user19": "Yeah... good."
