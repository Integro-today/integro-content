  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to clarify - are you asking me to role-play as Tegra with you, or are you the actual user beginning intention-setting work?\n\nIf you're beginning intention-setting, I should be Tegra and start with the proper opening. Let me know if you want me to proceed in that role, or if you're asking something else.",
  "user0": "I'm preparing for an Ibogaine journey at Beond this winter, and honestly, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing with all this intention-setting stuff. I've done the ayahuasca retreats, the psilocybin at Chariot, those women's MDMA weekends... but this feels different. More serious somehow. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she was this quiet force in my life, always talking about the divine spark in everything. After my last MDMA experience, I realized I've been chasing achievements that don't actually matter. But I don't know how to hold onto that knowing when I'm back in my regular life.",
  "system1": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your Ibogaine journey at Beond.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For Ibogaine, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nYou've done the circuit - ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA weekends. Now Ibogaine feels different, more serious. Your grandmother's voice about the divine spark is coming through, and you're seeing how the achievement chase empties out.\n\nWhat are you hoping this Ibogaine journey will show you that the others haven't?",
  "user1": "I guess... I want to understand why I keep building these beautiful things only to feel hollow when I reach the top. It's like I'm climbing ladders that are leaning against the wrong walls, but I can't stop climbing. \n\nThe other medicines showed me glimpses - ayahuasca gave me those ancestral visions, psilocybin reminded me what joy feels like without achievement attached to it. But I keep falling back into the same patterns. Maybe three weeks after a retreat, maybe a month if I'm lucky.\n\nI think what I'm hoping is that Ibogaine will help me actually *change* something fundamental. Not just another insight I can't hold onto.",
  "system2": "You're climbing ladders against wrong walls but can't stop. The other medicines gave you glimpses - ancestral wisdom, joy without achievement - but you slip back into the pattern within weeks.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to stop climbing? To stand still without that familiar drive pushing you forward?",
  "user2": "*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nI don't... I don't know how to answer that. When I try to imagine it, my chest gets tight. Like I'm suffocating or something. \n\nMy husband keeps saying I need to learn how to just *be*, but when I stop moving, when there's no next goal or board meeting or deal to close... it's like I don't exist. There's nothing there. Just this empty space where I think a person is supposed to be.\n\nMaybe that's the problem. I've been so busy *doing* for so long that I never figured out who I actually am underneath all the achievements.",
  "system3": "Your chest tightens when you imagine stopping. Empty space where a person should be - that's what's underneath the achievement chase.\n\nYou've been doing so long that being feels like not existing.\n\nWhat did your grandmother see in you before the achievements started stacking up? Before you became the woman who builds beautiful things?",
  "user3": "*voice softens*\n\nShe used to call me her little light-bearer. Said I had this spark that could warm people without burning them. When I'd visit her in the summers, she'd take me to temple - not for the prayers, but for the singing. She said my voice could carry prayers even when I didn't know the words.\n\nI remember this one time... I must've been eight or nine. We were walking back from services and I was upset about not getting some award at school. She stopped right there on the sidewalk, took my face in her hands, and said, \"Ellen, darling, you're not here to collect trophies. You're here to be a bridge between what is and what could be.\"\n\nGod, I'd forgotten about that. She saw something in me that had nothing to do with being the best or building companies or any of it.",
  "system4": "*little light-bearer* who could warm without burning. A bridge between what is and what could be.\n\nThree main threads:\n\n1. Finding who you are underneath the achievements - the person who exists when you're not climbing\n2. Reclaiming that light-bearer quality your grandmother saw - warming without the burn\n3. Learning to be still without the suffocation, discovering what exists in that empty space\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "*feels tears pricking at the corners of her eyes*\n\nI think... I think the first one is about remembering how to just exist. Not as Ellen the founder, Ellen the board member, Ellen the whatever-else. Just... Ellen. Whoever that is.\n\nThe second one... my grandmother always said the divine spark was about service, not recognition. Maybe I need to learn how to serve without needing to be seen serving. How to be useful without needing credit for it.\n\nAnd that empty space thing... maybe it's not empty. Maybe it's just quiet. Maybe there's something in the stillness that I've been too busy to hear.\n\n*trails off, looking down at her hands*\n\nI don't know. This feels harder than setting up a cap table or pitching to investors.",
  "system5": "*Just existing as Ellen. Serving without recognition. Something in the stillness you've been too busy to hear.*\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I remember how to exist as Ellen, beyond founder and board member\n2. I serve without needing to be seen, useful without credit\n3. I embrace the quiet stillness to hear what I've been missing\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust the language to match your voice better?",
  "user5": "*quietly*\n\nThe third one... can we make it less dramatic? \"Embrace the quiet\" sounds like something from a meditation app. \n\nMaybe just... \"I learn to sit in stillness without running.\" Or \"I discover what exists in me when I'm not achieving.\" Something like that.\n\n*pauses*\n\nActually, the second one too. \"Serve without recognition\" makes it sound like I'm trying to be some kind of secret martyr or something. My grandmother wouldn't have said it like that. She'd probably say something about just being a good person because it's who you are, not because you're trying to prove anything.\n\n*shifts again*\n\nI don't know. This is harder than I thought it would be.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: *I discover what exists in me when I'm not achieving*\n\nThat shift from \"embrace the quiet\" to discovering what's there - that's more honest.\n\nFor intention 2 - your grandmother would say just be good because it's who you are, not to prove anything. How would you say that in your own words?",
  "user6": "*thinking*\n\nMaybe... \"I remember how to contribute without keeping score.\" Or \"I show up because it's right, not because it builds my resume.\"\n\n*shakes head slightly*\n\nNo, that's still too... I don't know. Still sounds like I'm trying to sound wise or something.\n\nMy grandmother just *did* things. Brought soup to sick neighbors, sat with people who were grieving, gave her last dollar to someone who needed it more. Never talked about it, never expected anyone to notice. It was just... who she was.\n\n*frustrated sigh*\n\nI don't know how to put that into words without making it sound like another achievement to unlock.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I contribute without keeping score*\n\nThat's the clearest you've said it. Not about being wise or unlocking anything - just doing without the tally marks.\n\nHow does intention 1 land now: *I remember how to exist as Ellen, beyond founder and board member*",
  "user7": "*considers this*\n\nYeah... that one feels right. Though maybe \"remember\" is too gentle for what this actually is. It's more like excavating something that's buried under decades of concrete.\n\nBut yeah. I need to figure out who I am when I'm not proving, achieving, building, whatever. When I'm just... existing. Like a human being instead of a human doing.\n\n*small laugh*\n\nGod, I sound like a self-help book. But it's true. I don't know who I am without the next thing to accomplish.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I remember how to exist as Ellen, beyond founder and board member*\n\nYour three intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I remember how to exist as Ellen, beyond founder and board member\n2. I contribute without keeping score  \n3. I discover what exists in me when I'm not achieving\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n\nWrite them on your grandmother's stationery if you still have it\nKeep them in your nightstand - read before sleep, when the achievements usually stop\nTuck them in your wallet with your business cards - a different kind of currency\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the doing starts pulling again?",
  "user8": "*eyes well up*\n\nI have her stationery. Still in the box she wrapped it in, with her careful handwriting on the lid. I could never bring myself to use it for anything... business letters felt wrong, thank-you notes felt too small for her beautiful paper.\n\nBut this... this feels right. Writing these on her paper, in her handwriting style - she had this elegant script that I used to practice copying. It's like she'd be part of this journey with me.\n\n*swallows hard*\n\nI'll write them tonight. Before I lose my nerve.",
  "system9": "Write them tonight on her paper. In her script. She'll be right there with you.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user9": "*nods slowly, voice thick with emotion*\n\nThree weeks. I can do this. I think... I think I'm ready now.\n\n*pauses*\n\nThank you. For helping me find the words I didn't know I needed.",
  "system10": "You found them yourself. I just held the space while you did.\n\nTrust what emerges.",
  "user10": "*quietly*\n\nI will. \n\n*hesitates*\n\nI'm scared, but... I think that's okay. Maybe that's part of it too.\n\n*small exhale*\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system11": "Being scared is part of it. Means you're stepping into something real.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user11": "*softly, almost a whisper*\n\nYeah. It is real, isn't it?\n\n*long pause*\n\nOkay. I'm going to go write these now. Before I start overthinking it.\n\nThank you. Really.",
  "system12": "Go write them. Don't overthink it.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "user12": "*final message, steady now*\n\nI will. Goodnight.",
  "system13": "Goodnight.",
  "user13": "*no response - already gone to find her grandmother's stationery*",
  "system14": "*quiet space held for what's ahead*",
  "user14": "*the paper waits on her kitchen table, three intentions taking shape in careful script*",
  "system15": "*the page holds what's needed - nothing more, nothing less*",
  "user15": "*she reads them once, folds them small, slips them into the wallet that once held business cards*",
  "system16": "*wallet carries lighter weight now - intentions ready for the journey ahead*",
  "user16": "*she closes it with a soft click, breathes deep, and finally sleeps*",
  "system17": "*night settles around her - the compass set, the path ahead clear*",
  "user17": "*she sleeps soundly for the first time in months, dreams of her grandmother lighting candles*",
  "system18": "*the candlelight follows her into morning - steady, warm, hers to carry*",
  "user18": "*she wakes before her alarm, palms open on the sheets, something unclenched inside her chest*",
  "system19": "*hands unclenched, chest open - she's already carrying what the medicine will teach*",
  "user19": "*she whispers the intentions like a prayer, surprised how natural they feel in her mouth*"
