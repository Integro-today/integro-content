  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "jamie_adhd_persona_1",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know more about your specific journey to guide you properly. What medicine are you working with, and where are you in your process?",
  "user0": "Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks for ayahuasca. Amanda thinks this'll fix everything. I dont know man. Never done any of this stuff before.",
  "system1": "Three weeks to Costa Rica for ayahuasca. Amanda's hoping this fixes everything, and you're walking in not knowing what to expect.\n\nHeroic Hearts works with veterans, so I'm guessing there's some heavy stuff you're carrying. What are you hoping this medicine might help you with?",
  "user1": "Just want the nightmares to stop. Wake up screaming, she's exhausted. Kids look at me like... idk. Like Im a stranger. \n\nIf this plant stuff can stop that, maybe I can be normal again.",
  "system2": "Nightmares every night, waking up screaming. Kids looking at you like you're someone they don't recognize. That wears on everyone.\n\nWhen you imagine the nightmares stopping - what changes beyond just sleeping through the night? What would Amanda notice first?",
  "user2": "Maybe I dont jump when the car backfires. Maybe I can sit through dinner without snapping at Michael for talking too loud. Maybe Amanda stops sleeping in the guest room.\n\nI dont know. Just want her to look at me like she used to.",
  "system3": "No more jumping at backfires, no more snapping at Michael for being loud, Amanda sleeping next to you again. You want her to look at you like she used to.\n\nWhat's underneath the jumping and snapping? What's your body still protecting you from?",
  "user3": "Look. I dont want to go there. Just tell me what I need to do before this ceremony thing.",
  "system4": "Got it. You want practical steps, not deep dives.\n\nThree main threads:\n1. Stop the nightmares so Amanda can sleep with you again\n2. End the hypervigilance - no more jumping at sounds or snapping at the kids\n3. Get Amanda to look at you like she used to\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry into ceremony.",
  "user4": "Yeah. That sounds right. \n\nHow do I make intentions out of that? I dont want to mess this up.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I release the hypervigilance, teaching my body it's safe at home\n3. I open to being present with my family without scanning for threats\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "Can we make it simpler? This feels... I dont know. Too fancy.\n\nLike \"I want to sleep through the night\" and \"I want to stop jumping at everything\" and \"I want to be a better husband.\"\n\nThats it.",
  "system6": "Got it. Simple and direct:\n\n1. I want to sleep through the night\n2. I want to stop jumping at everything\n3. I want to be a better husband\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I want to sleep through the night\n\nThese are your words, not mine. How do the other two land?",
  "user6": "Yeah. Those three.\n\nGuess Im ready then.",
  "system7": "Good. You've got three solid intentions.\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card in your wallet\n- Keep them on your phone lock screen\n- Read them each morning before the ceremony\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user7": "Phone lock screen I guess. Always got that on me.",
  "system8": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I want to sleep through the night\n- I want to stop jumping at everything  \n- I want to be a better husband\n\nYour ritual: phone lock screen. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user8": "yeah. okay. \n\nidk if thisll work but at least i know what im aiming for.",
  "system9": "That's the point. You know what you're aiming for. That's enough for now.",
  "user9": "yeah. thats all i got.",
  "system10": "Then you're ready.",
  "user10": "yeah. guess i am.",
  "system11": "Good. Three weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user11": "yeah. three weeks.",
  "system12": "See you on the other side.",
  "user12": "yeah. see you.",
