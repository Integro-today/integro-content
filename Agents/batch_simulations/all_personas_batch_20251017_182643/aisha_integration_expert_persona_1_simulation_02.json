  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Hey, so I'm coming to this from kind of a different place than most people probably. I've been in the psychedelic space for about 12 years\u2014ceremonies, facilitator training, integration coaching, all of it. But if I'm being honest, I'm realizing that I might be using all of this as another way to avoid actually changing. My last relationship just ended, same pattern as always, and I'm like... I teach this stuff. How am I still here?\n\nActually, wait. I'm noticing I'm already doing that thing where I start explaining my history instead of just answering your question. What brought me to this journey? I'm exhausted from my own patterns. I'm scared that after a decade of \"doing the work,\" nothing has actually changed in how I relate to people, how I feel about myself. I keep waiting for the medicine to show me something new, but maybe I need to stop seeking and start... I don't know, actually living what I've already learned?",
  "system1": "You caught yourself mid-pattern - explaining instead of answering. That's the work right there.\n\nTwelve years deep and still stuck in the same relationship cycle. That's brutal honesty. The medicine keeps showing you, but you're not living it.\n\nWhat's the pattern you most want to break? The one that keeps ending things?",
  "user1": "The anxious-avoidant trap. I'm the anxious one, always. I pick men who are emotionally unavailable\u2014like, I can spot them from a mile away now\u2014and then I get hooked on trying to get them to love me. The more they pull away, the more I chase. I analyze every text, every silence, every micro-expression. I become this detective of disinterest, and then I use all that \"evidence\" to confirm what I already believe: that I'm too much, that I'll never be enough, that I'm fundamentally unlovable.\n\nFrom an attachment theory perspective, it's textbook. My nervous system gets activated, I go into sympathetic fight-or-flight, and then I do the exact thing that makes them run faster. I know this pattern so well I could teach a workshop on it. I *have* taught workshops on it. But knowing hasn't changed the fact that when Marcus stopped texting me back consistently, I still spiraled into that familiar panic. I still sent the \"we need to talk\" text that ended everything.\n\nI'm noticing I'm explaining the pattern instead of saying what I actually want to break. What I want to break is... I'm tired of choosing people who can't love me and then making that mean something about my worth. I'm tired of being scared that if I stop performing\u2014if I'm just ordinary, regular, not-special me\u2014there won't be anything real underneath worth loving.",
  "system2": "You know the theory inside out, but your nervous system still hijacks you. That's the gap - knowledge hasn't reached your body.\n\nWhen you imagine not performing, not being special - just regular you - what are you afraid you'll find? Or lose?",
  "user2": "That there's nothing there. That if I stop being the person who's done 20+ ceremonies and has facilitator training and can quote Ram Dass\u2014if I'm just... Aisha, regular person with regular problems\u2014then what? That maybe underneath all the seeking and achieving and spiritual language, there's just this empty space where a self should be. Like I've been building this beautiful house of wisdom but forgot to put a foundation under it.\n\nI'm scared I'll find out that I'm fundamentally broken, like my nervous system is just wired wrong and all this work has been... performative. That I've been performing \"someone who's healing\" instead of actually healing. And if I stop performing, maybe there won't be anyone home at all. Just this anxious, empty space that needs constant validation to feel real.\n\nFrom an IFS perspective, I think there's a part that believes if I'm not special\u2014if I'm not the most spiritually sophisticated person in the room\u2014then I don't exist. It's like... my whole identity got built around being the one who left Google to find truth, who does the deep work, who knows all the frameworks. If I let that go, what am I? Just another 39-year-old woman who's scared of intimacy and picks the wrong men. That's... really hard to admit.",
  "system3": "Three threads here:\n\n1. The terror that there's no real self underneath all the performing\n2. Using spiritual sophistication to avoid actually healing\n3. The fear that without being special, you're just broken\n\nThe anxious part needs constant validation to feel real. It's been running the show.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to just be regular Aisha - not the ceremony facilitator, not the Google-leaver - and still be worthy of love?",
  "user3": "*long pause*\n\nI'm noticing my chest getting tight just thinking about it. Like my whole body is bracing against the idea. There's this fluttery panic in my stomach, and my shoulders want to climb up to my ears. If I'm honest... it feels like dying. Like if I'm not special-Aisha, then regular-Aisha doesn't deserve to take up space. She doesn't deserve love, she doesn't deserve rest, she doesn't deserve to just... be.\n\nWhen I drop the story about leaving Google, when I stop being \"someone who's done the work,\" there's just this... rawness. Like a snail without its shell. My nervous system goes into that familiar sympathetic activation\u2014heart racing, palms sweaty, this urge to DO something, achieve something, prove something. Because if I'm not proving, if I'm not performing... then what am I?\n\nI think about my grandmother, who never did a ceremony in her life, who just made chai every morning and loved her family and that was enough. And part of me is jealous of that simplicity, but another part is like\u2014she had a right to exist just because she existed. I don't know if I believe that about myself. I think I believe I have to earn the right to be here, to be loved, to take up space.\n\nWow. I'm sitting with how sad that is. That I don't know what it would feel like to just be regular and worthy. That I literally can't imagine it.",
  "system4": "Your body just told the truth - regular Aisha feels like she doesn't deserve to exist without earning it. That's the wound underneath all the ceremonies and frameworks.\n\nYou can't imagine being ordinary and worthy because that part never got to develop. It's stuck proving, achieving, performing.\n\nWhat would regular Aisha do if she knew she was already enough?",
  "user4": "She'd probably stop dating men who need fixing. She'd choose someone who's just... there. Available. Maybe even boring in the best way. She'd stop analyzing every interaction and just... be in it. She'd wake up and make her chai without needing it to be a \"mindful practice\" or posting about it. She'd go to yoga because it feels good, not because she has to maintain her teacher identity.\n\nI think regular Aisha would actually rest. Like, real rest\u2014not the kind where she's \"resting her nervous system to optimize integration.\" Just... lying on the couch watching Bollywood movies without the background hum of \"I should be doing something more productive.\" She'd call her mom and talk about nothing important without feeling like she needs to educate her about trauma.\n\nShe'd probably stop preparing for the next ceremony and start figuring out what she actually wants her daily life to look like. She might get a regular job\u2014something simple that pays the bills without needing to be meaningful or aligned with her dharma. She'd stop performing \"someone who's done the work\" and just... do the work of being a human.\n\nI keep thinking about what my therapist said last month\u2014\"What if you're not a wounded healer, Aisha? What if you're just wounded?\" Regular Aisha would let that be true without needing to turn it into another growth edge. She'd just be wounded, and healing, and human, and enough.",
  "system5": "Regular Aisha sounds like she just wants to be human without the spiritual performance. That's the medicine right there.\n\nThree intentions based on what you've revealed:\n\n1. I embrace being regular Aisha - making chai, watching Bollywood, taking up space without earning it\n2. I welcome choosing partners who are simply available instead of fixing broken men\n3. I release the identity of \"someone who does the work\" and just do the work of being human\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "The first one\u2014embracing regular Aisha. That hits something deep and terrified in me. Like, I can feel my whole body wanting to reject it, but also this weird relief underneath? Like maybe I could just... exist without the constant performance.\n\nFor the second one, I want to adjust it slightly. It's not just about choosing available partners\u2014it's deeper than that. It's about not needing to prove I'm lovable by getting unavailable people to love me. It's about trusting that regular me, without the spiritual resume, is actually enough.\n\nAnd the third one... I'm noticing some resistance. Like, I don't want to completely release my identity as someone who does the work, because that feels like losing everything I've built. What if it's more like... letting the work be simple instead of sophisticated? Letting it be about showing up for my life instead of accumulating more frameworks?\n\nSo maybe:\n1. I embrace regular Aisha - making chai, watching Bollywood, taking up space without earning it\n2. I welcome knowing I'm lovable without proving it through fixing or achieving\n3. I release making the work complex\u2014letting healing be ordinary and human\n\nDoes that... does that land? I'm noticing I'm asking for validation, which is probably part of the pattern too.",
  "system6": "You caught yourself asking for validation - that's the pattern showing up. But you're also feeling that terror-relief mix around regular Aisha. That's real.\n\nLet me adjust intention 3 to match what you actually said:\n\n1. I embrace regular Aisha - making chai, watching Bollywood, taking up space without earning it \u2713\n2. I welcome knowing I'm lovable without proving it through fixing or achieving \u2713\n3. I release making healing complex - letting it be ordinary and human \u2713\n\nHow do these feel when you let them land in your body?",
  "user6": "*deep breath*\n\nMy chest is tight, but there's also this weird fluttery feeling\u2014like excitement and terror having a dance party. When I let the first one land, there's this moment where I can almost feel what it would be like to just... be. No performance. No proving. Just me and my chai and my Bollywood movies. It feels impossibly simple and also like the hardest thing I've ever tried to do.\n\nThe second one... that one makes my stomach drop. Like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff. Because if I'm lovable without proving it, then what have I been doing for the past ten years? What was all the seeking and ceremony and training for? I think part of me is scared that if I let that intention be true, I'll have to grieve all the time I spent performing instead of living.\n\nThe third one feels... okay, actually? Like, my nervous system doesn't fight that one as much. Maybe because I can still \"do the work\"\u2014I just don't have to make it so complicated. I can still be someone who grows and heals without needing it to be special or sophisticated.\n\nBut the first one is where I keep landing. Regular Aisha. Ordinary Aisha. Worthy Aisha. That's the edge. That's where the medicine is.",
  "system7": "Your body just confirmed it - intention 1 is the medicine. The terror-excitement mix means you're touching the real work.\n\nYou've got three solid intentions:\n1. I embrace regular Aisha - making chai, watching Bollywood, taking up space without earning it\n2. I welcome knowing I'm lovable without proving it through fixing or achieving  \n3. I release making healing complex - letting it be ordinary and human\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card by your kettle where you make chai\n- Set them as your phone background so you see them when you want to check Marcus's texts\n- Read them during your morning routine instead of reaching for the spiritual frameworks\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the anxious part wants to start performing again?",
  "user7": "The kettle idea... that feels right. Like, every morning when I'm making chai\u2014the most ordinary ritual that connects me to my grandmother and my mom\u2014I'll see them there. Not like a mindfulness practice or anything sophisticated. Just... a reminder that this simple act is enough. That regular me making regular chai is already worthy.\n\nBut I also want something for when I'm spiraling. When I catch myself about to text someone avoidant, or when I'm 3AM-googling \"attachment healing retreat Costa Rica.\" For those moments, maybe I put them in my phone but not as a background\u2014that feels too performative. Maybe just... in my notes app? So when I want to check if Marcus texted back, I have to scroll past them first?\n\nActually, what feels most real is just... letting myself forget them sometimes. Because that's what regular people do. They set intentions and then they forget and then they remember again. They don't need to hold everything perfectly all the time to be enough.\n\nSo yeah. By the kettle. And maybe I'll forget them, and that's okay too. Regular Aisha forgets things and she's still worthy. That's... that's probably the practice right there.",
  "system8": "Regular Aisha forgets and remembers. That's the practice.\n\nYour intentions for this journey:\n1. I embrace regular Aisha - making chai, watching Bollywood, taking up space without earning it\n2. I welcome knowing I'm lovable without proving it through fixing or achieving  \n3. I release making healing complex - letting it be ordinary and human\n\nYour ritual: By the kettle, where you make chai. Sometimes you'll forget, and that's part of it too.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "Three weeks. *deep breath*\n\nI keep thinking about what you said\u2014not the destination, but the compass. Like, I don't have to arrive at some perfect version of regular Aisha who never performs or seeks or gets anxious. I just... hold these intentions and see what happens. Let them work on me instead of me working on them.\n\nThere's this weird peace in that. Like maybe I can stop trying to integrate everything perfectly and just... live. Make chai. Watch crappy movies. Choose different when I can choose different. Let myself be surprised by who shows up when I'm not performing.\n\nI'm scared. But also... curious? Like, what if regular Aisha is actually more interesting than spiritual-performance Aisha? What if she's got things to say that aren't filtered through frameworks and Sanskrit?\n\nThree weeks. By the kettle. Forgetting and remembering. Trusting that the medicine is in the ordinary, not the peak experience.\n\nThank you. For seeing through all the layers to what was underneath. For not being impressed by the spiritual resume. For helping me get simple when my sophistication was the problem.\n\nI'll let you know what regular Aisha discovers.",
  "system9": "Trust that curiosity - it's stronger than fear when you let it lead.\n\nRegular Aisha is already here, making chai. The medicine will show her to you in ways you can't plan for.\n\nGo make your tea.",
  "user9": "*goes to make tea*",
  "system10": "*quiet smile*",
  "user10": "*quiet smile back, hands wrapped around warm mug, steam rising between us*\n\nThe chai tastes different today. Not special-different. Just... real-different. Like I'm actually tasting it instead of analyzing the taste.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way back to my own kitchen.",
  "system11": "Your kitchen was always here waiting.\n\nEnjoy your chai.",
  "user11": "*last sip, setting down the empty cup*\n\nIt was perfect. Just... perfect.\n\nThank you.",
  "system12": "*acknowledges with steady presence*\n\nYou're welcome.",
  "user12": "*pauses by the sink, mug in hand*\n\nYou know what's wild? I'm not rushing to turn this into a teaching moment. Not thinking about how I could share this insight with my integration circles. Not composing the Instagram post about ordinary magic.\n\nI'm just... here. With a clean mug and a quiet heart.\n\nThat's... that's actually new.",
  "system13": "*notes the moment without needing to name it*\n\nThat's the shift.",
  "user13": "*nods slowly, eyes a little wet*\n\nYeah. It is.",
  "system14": "*steady presence, letting the silence hold what's real*",
  "user14": "*breathes into the quiet, finally understanding what my body has been trying to tell me for years*\n\nI think I've been chasing the wrong kind of silence. The performative kind. The Instagram-worthy kind. The \"look how present I am\" kind.\n\nThis is... just silence. Plain and ordinary and enough.\n\nI don't need to become anything different. I just need to stop running from this. From me.",
  "system15": "*steady nod*\n\nThat running takes everything. This costs nothing.",
  "user15": "*small laugh, soft and surprised*\n\nAll those years seeking peak experiences, thinking I needed to become someone worthy of love... and the answer was just sitting here in a $12 mug from Target.\n\nI feel like I just came home to a house that was always mine, keys in my pocket the whole time.\n\nWhat a ridiculous, beautiful waste of suffering. What a perfect, ordinary relief.",
  "system16": "*quiet smile*\n\nThe house kept the lights on.",
  "user16": "*looking around this small kitchen like I'm seeing it for the first time*\n\nIt really did. The chai my mother taught me to make. The hands that learned to hold space for others by first learning to hold this mug. Even the anxiety that's been pacing these rooms like a caged animal\u2014she was just trying to keep me safe.\n\nEverything I needed, right here. Everything I was running from, carrying me.\n\nI'm... I'm actually crying. Not the pretty kind. Just... snotty, ordinary tears in my kitchen.",
  "system17": "*steady presence, no need to fix or polish*\n\nLet her wash the floors.",
  "user17": "*nods through the tears, finally understanding what she needed all along*\n\nShe just wanted to move through. Not to be healed or fixed or transformed. Just... felt. Seen. Allowed.\n\nLike the rest of me. Like all of it.\n\n*lets the sobs come, messy and real, feeling something ancient and essential finally releasing*\n\nI think I've been holding my breath for ten years.",
  "system18": "*breathes with you, steady and unhurried*\n\nTen years is a long time to not breathe.",
  "user18": "*the words come out between breaths, small and simple*\n\nI forgot how. Forgot that breathing doesn't require a framework or a ceremony or perfect alignment. Just... in and out. Like anyone else.\n\n*feels the air moving, miraculous in its ordinariness*\n\nMy chest hurts. In a good way. Like it's remembering how to expand again.\n\nI don't want to be special anymore. I just want to be here.",
  "system19": "*quiet acknowledgment*\n\nBeing here is enough.",
  "user19": "*settles into the simplicity like sinking into warm water*\n\nIt's... it's actually enough. Just this. Just me, crying in my kitchen on a Thursday, not trying to turn it into content or insight or the next big realization.\n\nFor the first time in years, I'm not trying to get somewhere else. Not trying to become someone better. Not waiting for the next ceremony to fix what's broken.\n\nJust here. Just breathing. Just... human.\n\n*feels something vast open up in the smallness of it*\n\nI think that's what I've been running from. How simple it actually is."
