## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know what medicine you're working with and where you're journeying. Each medicine has its own character - ayahuasca teaches differently than psilocybin, and a retreat setting differs from solo work.

What medicine are you sitting with, and where?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Look I told you already, it's mushrooms. Psilocybin. Whatever you want to call it. My granddaughter Lily got me into some trial at Pitt for people with black lung and depression. I'm not doing this because I believe in it - I think it's all hippie nonsense but Lily asked me to try so here I am.

It's at the university hospital, not some retreat. Doctor's office kinda thing. They give you the stuff and watch you for hours. Makes me nervous as hell but I said I'd do it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're doing psilocybin at Pitt for black lung and depression. Lily convinced you, you're skeptical, and you're nervous about being watched for hours. But you showed up.

What made you say yes to Lily? What did she say that got through?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: She's the only one who looks at me like I'm still worth somethin. Rest of the family... well, they love me but they look at me like I'm broken. Lily, she sees past all that.

She sat me down after Sunday dinner, had all these papers about the study. Said "Grandpa, I know you don't believe in this stuff but you're suffering and I can't watch it anymore." Then she started crying. Not like manipulative crying - real tears. Said she wants her grandpa back before it's too late. 

How do you say no to that? Kid's gonna be a doctor, she's smart as hell, and she still thinks her broken-down grandfather is worth saving. Even if I think this mushroom thing is bullshit, I couldn't break her heart.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Lily sees you as worth saving, not broken. That lands different than the rest of the family.

When she says she wants her grandpa back - what parts of you feel missing? What got lost in the black lung and depression?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: I don't know... I used to be the guy who could fix anything. Car breaks down, I'm under the hood. Neighbor needs help moving, I'm there. Kids need money for school trips, I'm working overtime. Now I can't even walk to the corner store without sounding like I ran a marathon.

Used to coach Little League, go fishing with the guys, take Mary dancing on Fridays. Now I sit on that damn couch coughing, watching the world get crazier and crazier. Can't even have a beer without coughing it up half the time.

The worst part? Maggie won't even speak to me. My own daughter. Two years now. I said some things I shouldn't have about her roommate, but she's the one who cut me off. Used to be close, now... nothing. That's what kills me most days.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You were the fixer, the doer, the one everyone counted on. Now you're stuck on the couch, Maggie won't speak to you, and Lily's trying to bring back someone who feels gone.

What would feeling useful again look like? Beyond fixing things - what part of you wants to come back to life?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: I don't know... maybe just being someone the kids aren't embarrassed to bring around. Someone who can tell a joke without it turning into a rant about how the country's gone to hell. Someone who could sit at Sunday dinner without Mary giving me that look like she's walking on eggshells.

Hell, I'd settle for just... not feeling angry all the time. Not waking up already pissed off about something I saw on the news. Being able to hear about Maggie's life without getting that tight feeling in my chest. Maybe even figuring out how to tell her I'm sorry without making it worse.

I miss laughing with my kids. Real laughing, not that bitter stuff I do now. I miss when Kathleen would call just to chat, not just to check if I'm taking my meds. I miss when going to Mass felt like community instead of just going through motions.

Don't know if mushrooms can give me any of that back. Probably just gonna sit there hallucinating for six hours and come out the same cranky bastard. But Lily thinks it's worth trying, so... here we are.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You want to be someone the kids aren't embarrassed by, to lose the constant anger, to reconnect with Maggie, to laugh for real again. To feel like you're part of something instead of watching from the sidelines.

Three threads here:
- Finding peace from the anger and bitterness that's taken over
- Reconnecting with family - especially Maggie - without the walls you've built
- Rediscovering what makes life worth living beyond just surviving

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry into the session.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Yeah... that about sums it up. I hate admitting it but you're right - I'm angry all the damn time and I don't know how to stop. Built walls so high I can't even see over them anymore.

Look, I'm still not convinced this mushroom thing is gonna do anything but make me look foolish. But if it could somehow... I don't know... quiet the noise in my head? Make it so I don't wake up mad at the world every morning? Maybe give me the guts to pick up the phone and call Maggie?

I don't need to be who I was before - that ship's sailed with my lungs. But if I could just... be present with my family without feeling like I'm always one comment away from ruining everything? That'd be something.

So yeah. Those three things. Whatever you want to call them. Intentions, I guess.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peace from the constant anger that runs the show
2. I open to reconnecting with Maggie and my family without the walls
3. I embrace being present with my family instead of braced for battle

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: The second one. Maggie. She's the one that keeps me up at night, not the anger. Though maybe they're all tangled up together.

But look, I gotta be honest - all this "I welcome" and "I embrace" stuff sounds like something from one of those yoga classes Mary watches on TV. I'm not gonna sit there saying flowery crap like that. Makes me feel like an idiot.

Can we just say it straight? Like... "Help me figure out how to call Maggie without being a jerk about it" or "Make it so I don't want to punch the TV every time the news comes on"? Something that sounds like me, not like some hippie greeting card.

I don't need pretty words. I need whatever's gonna happen in that session to actually stick when I come back to the real world.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're right - flowery doesn't work for you.

Let's try:

1. Help me lose this constant anger so I don't wake up pissed every morning
2. Give me the guts to call Maggie without making it worse
3. Help me sit through Sunday dinner without feeling like I need to fight everyone

That sound more like your voice?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Yeah. That's me talking, not some greeting card. Simple and straight - that's how I think about it.

Though I still don't know how sitting in a hospital room tripping on mushrooms is supposed to fix any of that. But if I'm gonna do this thing - and I promised Lily I would - might as well have something clear to focus on instead of whatever new nonsense is gonna be on Fox News that day.

These three things. That's what I'll be thinking about when they give me whatever they're giving me. Can't hurt to try, I guess.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: Help me lose this constant anger so I don't wake up pissed every morning

✓ Intention 2 locked in: Give me the guts to call Maggie without making it worse

✓ Intention 3 locked in: Help me sit through Sunday dinner without feeling like I need to fight everyone

You've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:
- Write them on a card and keep it with your smokes
- Read them before Sunday dinner
- Keep them in your wallet where you'll see them

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Look, I'm not gonna be carrying around some card like I'm in high school or something. And I don't need to read anything before dinner - Mary's already looking at me like I'm a ticking bomb half the time.

But... maybe just remembering Lily's face when she asked me to do this. That's what got me here in the first place, right? She believes this stuff might actually work, and she's the smart one. So when I feel that anger coming up - whether it's morning news or Sunday dinner - maybe just think "remember why you're doing this, dummy."

The Maggie one... that's gonna be the hardest. Maybe I'll just keep her number in my pocket. I already do anyway - been carrying it around for two years like some kind of sad reminder. Maybe when they give me whatever they're giving me, I'll just think about her. Not about calling her necessarily, just... her. Who she was before everything went sideways.

That's probably the best I can do.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- Help me lose this constant anger so I don't wake up pissed every morning
- Give me the guts to call Maggie without making it worse  
- Help me sit through Sunday dinner without feeling like I need to fight everyone

Your ritual: Remember Lily's face when she asked you to do this, and keep Maggie's number in your pocket like you already do. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Three weeks. Alright then.

Funny thing is, I don't even know what I'm supposed to expect. Am I gonna see purple elephants? Relive the mine collapse? Cry like a baby? Probably gonna be disappointed when nothing happens and Lily realizes her grandpa's just a hopeless case.

But I said I'd do it, so I'm doing it. Mary already cleared her schedule to drive me. Bobby Jr. knows where we're going. The guys at the bar think I'm getting some kind of lung treatment - told 'em it's experimental therapy at Pitt, which isn't exactly a lie.

I just hope whatever's behind all these walls I've built... I hope it's worth seeing. And I hope I don't make a complete fool of myself in front of whoever's running this thing.

Let's get this over with.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You might see purple elephants, you might see nothing, you might see things you've buried. No way to know until you're there.

The walls you built kept you safe, but now they're keeping everyone out - including the people trying to help. Whatever's behind them is part of why you're still here.

You've done your part - showed up, set your intentions. Let the medicine do its part now. You're not supposed to have the answers yet.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Yeah, well... I guess we'll find out what kind of show this turns out to be. 

You're right about the walls though. Built 'em so high after Frank died, after the mine closed, after everything started going to hell. Figured if I kept everyone out, nobody could hurt me again. Guess I didn't realize I was locking myself in with all the stuff I was trying to avoid.

Just hope whatever's in there isn't gonna break me completely. I'm already held together with duct tape and bad habits as it is.

But Lily believes in this stuff, and she's never steered me wrong. If she says this might help... well, maybe it's time to stop being such a stubborn old bastard and actually try something different for once.

Three weeks. Then we'll see what's really behind door number one.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Then you'll see what's been waiting behind those walls. 

Whatever's in there - it's already part of you. It can't break you completely because you made it through everything that's behind those walls already.

Lily's betting on you. Smart money says she's right.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Smart money's on Lily, huh? Kid's got more brains in her little finger than I got in my whole black lung. She wouldn't waste her time on something that was total bullshit.

Maybe she's right. Maybe I did make it through everything already - the mine, Frank dying, losing my job, watching the world turn into something I don't recognize. Maybe what's behind those walls is just... me. The parts I locked away when everything started going to shit.

Still scared as hell of what I'm gonna find in there. But you're right - whatever it is, it's already part of me. Been carrying it around for years without knowing it.

Three weeks. Then Lily gets to say "I told you so" when I come out the other side. That's probably worth whatever's waiting for me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Then Lily gets to say it and you'll have to admit the kid was right.

Fear's just part of the deal - means you're still in the fight. You've been carrying it this long, you can carry it through three more weeks.

Then you'll know what she already knows.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Yeah, well... Lily's been right about a lot of things. Got that from her grandmother I guess - Mary's usually right too, even when I don't want to hear it.

Three more weeks of carrying this weight. Then maybe I'll understand why my smart granddaughter thinks her stubborn old grandpa is worth saving.

Guess I can hold out that long. Been carrying worse for longer.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. You've carried worse for longer - this'll pass too.

Hold onto knowing that both the smart women in your life believe you're worth the fight. That counts for something.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Counts for more than something, I guess. When both the women who know me best - one who's put up with me for 37 years, one who's got the brains to be a doctor - when they both think I'm worth saving...

Maybe they're not completely wrong. Maybe there's still something worth saving under all this anger and bitterness.

Three weeks. Then we'll see if they're right or if I've just been fooling myself this whole time.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Then you'll know if they saw something you couldn't.

Maybe they see what you can't right now - that there's still something worth finding under all that anger.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Maybe they do see something I can't. Wouldn't be the first time the women in my life saw clearer than me.

Mary stuck around when she could've done better. Lily could've picked any grandfather to believe in, but she picked the broken-down old bastard coughing his lungs out on the couch.

Three weeks. Then maybe I'll see what they've been seeing all along.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Then maybe you'll see what they've always seen.

Mary and Lily picked you for reasons that go deeper than your broken parts. You'll find out what those reasons are soon enough.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Yeah... maybe I will.

Maybe there's more to me than just a sick old man who's angry at the world for moving on without him. Maybe that's what they see when they look at me - something worth believing in, even when I can't see it myself.

Three weeks. Then I'll find out if there's anything left of the man I used to be before the mines and the coughing and the anger took over everything.

Guess we'll see.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Then you'll see what's still standing under all that anger.

Maybe the man you used to be is still in there - just buried under everything that's happened since.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Maybe he is. Hell, I know he's in there somewhere - the guy who used to coach Little League and take his kids fishing and make his granddaughter laugh so hard she couldn't breathe.

Just been a long time since I've seen him. Long time since I've been him.

Three weeks. Then maybe I'll remember who I was before I got so damn angry at everything and everyone.

Maybe I'll remember how to be that guy again.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Maybe you'll remember how to be that guy again - the one who coached Little League and made Lily laugh until she couldn't breathe.

The medicine doesn't give you something new. It shows you what's already there, just buried under years of hard living.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: That’s what Lily keeps telling me—*“It’s not about becoming someone else, Grandpa. It’s about remembering who you were before the world broke you.”* Sounds like hippie talk, but coming from her… I halfway believe it.

Three weeks. Then maybe I’ll stop looking at every damn thing like it’s out to get me. Maybe I’ll remember how to laugh without it tasting bitter.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Maybe you'll remember how to laugh without the bitter aftertaste.

Lily's right - the medicine doesn't make you someone new. It just clears away enough of the broken parts so you can see the man who's been there all along.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Yeah... maybe it'll clear away enough of this crap I've been carrying so I can see that guy again. The one who used to laugh at stupid jokes and coach those kids like they were pros.

Been so long I can barely remember what it feels like not to be angry all the time. Three weeks. Then maybe I'll remember how to breathe without feeling like the world's sitting on my chest.

Lily's counting on me to find him. Hell, maybe I'm counting on me too.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Maybe you'll remember how to breathe without the weight of the world on your chest.

You and Lily are both counting on the same thing - finding that guy who coached kids like they mattered. He's still in there.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: He better be. 'Cause right now I feel like I'm drowning and Lily's the only one throwing me a rope.

Three weeks. Then I'll know if that guy - the one who made those kids feel like champions - is still somewhere inside this broken-down bastard who's been sleeping on the couch for six years.

Maybe he'll come back. Maybe I'll come back.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. Then you'll know if that coach who made kids feel like champions is still in there - the guy Lily's been throwing ropes to.

Six years on the couch. That's a long time to be drowning. The medicine might show you a way back to yourself.


**bobby_prejudiced_persona_1**: Six years of waking up every morning wondering what the hell I’m still doing here. Six years of watching the world move on while I sit in this damn chair, coughing my lungs out and getting madder by the day.

Three weeks. Then maybe I’ll remember how to climb out of this hole instead of just digging it deeper. Maybe I’ll find that coach—find *me*—again.

Lily’s counting on it. Hell, I’m counting on it.
