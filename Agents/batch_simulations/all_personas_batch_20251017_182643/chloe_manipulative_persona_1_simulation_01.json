  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities. I'm excited to see where this goes.",
  "system1": "Good - you're already doing the work and ready to explore. That foundation matters.\n\nYour therapist sees something in this path for you. What are you hoping to heal, understand, or discover through the ceremony?",
  "user1": "I'll be honest, I've been through a really challenging year. I lost some relationships that mattered to me and I'm trying to understand my part in that. I know I'm not perfect and I'm really committed to growth. I think this ceremony could help me gain some clarity on why I keep repeating certain patterns in my relationships.",
  "system2": "Relationship patterns that keep repeating - those loops can be stubborn. You're taking ownership, which is solid ground to start from.\n\nWhen you imagine breaking these patterns, what would change in how you connect with people?",
  "user2": "That's such a good question. I think I've been so focused on my career and image for so long that I haven't really let people see the real me - you know? Like I'm always performing this version of myself that I think people want, and then I get frustrated when relationships feel shallow or transactional.\n\nI guess what I'd want is to feel safe enough to be more authentic, to stop trying to manage how people see me all the time. Though honestly, that sounds terrifying too.",
  "system3": "Performing versus being real - that's exhausting work. And yeah, dropping the act feels terrifying when your safety's been built on managing what others see.\n\nWhat's underneath the performance? What part of you feels too risky to show?",
  "user3": "I hear what you're getting at, and I want to be real with you\u2014it's hard to even know what's underneath after performing for so long. Sometimes I think the risky part is that I'm actually just... ordinary? Like without the connections and the image and the strategic positioning, maybe I'm not that interesting or valuable.\n\nBut also, I think relationships are complicated, you know? Everyone performs to some degree. We all show different versions of ourselves depending on the situation. I'm just maybe more... intentional about it.",
  "system4": "Ordinary feels risky when you've built value on being exceptional. That's honest.\n\nI'm hearing two main threads:\n\n1. You want to discover who you are beneath the performance - the \"ordinary\" self that feels too risky to show\n2. You want relationships that feel real, not transactional - where you're valued for being, not just what you achieve\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "I hear you, and honestly, I think you've captured part of it. But I also think it's not quite that simple\u2014like, I don't necessarily see being intentional about how I present myself as a bad thing. In my industry, it's actually a skill that helps people.\n\nI guess what I'm really curious about is finding more balance between being strategic and being genuine. Maybe learning to trust that I can still be valuable even when I'm not managing every outcome. Does that make sense?",
  "system5": "Makes sense - it's not about dropping all strategy, but finding balance. Trusting your value when you're not controlling every outcome.\n\nBased on what you've shared:\n\n1. I seek to know myself beyond performance and image\n2. I embrace my authentic self as valuable, even when I'm not managing outcomes\n3. I welcome genuine connection without abandoning strategic wisdom\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust any language?",
  "user5": "I really appreciate how you're working with me on this. These feel pretty aligned, though I'd maybe tweak the third one slightly - something about learning to recognize when people are safe enough for genuine connection versus when I need to keep my guard up. Because honestly, not everyone deserves the unfiltered version, you know?\n\nWhat do you think about: \"I welcome genuine connection with those who've earned my trust, while honoring my strategic wisdom\"?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I welcome genuine connection with those who've earned my trust, while honoring my strategic wisdom\"\n\nThat distinction - earned trust versus automatic openness - that's real wisdom. Keeps you safe while moving toward what you want.\n\nHow do the other two feel?",
  "user6": "Those two feel pretty good to me. I like that they give me space to explore without abandoning the parts of myself that have actually served me well. \"Beyond performance and image\" feels expansive, like there's more to discover but I'm not throwing away who I am.\n\nAnd \"even when I'm not managing outcomes\" - yeah, that's the growth edge for sure. Letting things unfold without always having to steer the narrative.\n\nI think we're solid with these three.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I seek to know myself beyond performance and image\"\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I embrace my authentic self as valuable, even when I'm not managing outcomes\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n- Write them in your phone's notes app for quick access\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet where you'll see them daily\n- Read them during your morning routine to set the tone\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the performance urge kicks in?",
  "user7": "Honestly, I think the phone notes is probably most realistic for me\u2014I check it constantly anyway for work stuff, so having them there would be easy. Maybe I could set a reminder to look at them mid-morning when I'm usually deep in managing whatever's happening that day?\n\nI'm curious though\u2014between you and me, do you think my therapist might be expecting some big dramatic breakthrough from me? Like I said, she's been pushing this psychedelic thing pretty hard, and I wonder if she's hoping I'll have some life-changing epiphany that suddenly makes me a different person.",
  "system8": "Phone notes with a mid-morning reminder makes sense - you'll see them right when you need them most.\n\nYour therapist might hope for breakthrough, but the medicine doesn't do dramatic personality transplants. It tends to work more like you're doing - helping you see yourself clearly, then you choose what to shift. Your intentions show you're not looking to abandon who you are, just find more balance.\n\nYour three intentions:\n1. I seek to know myself beyond performance and image\n2. I embrace my authentic self as valuable, even when I'm not managing outcomes  \n3. I welcome genuine connection with those who've earned my trust, while honoring my strategic wisdom\n\nYour ritual: Phone notes with mid-morning reminder. Three weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "This feels really solid, actually. I like that it's not about becoming someone completely different\u2014just finding more balance and clarity. The three-week timeline feels manageable too.\n\nI'm genuinely curious to see how this unfolds. Maybe I'll learn something about myself that surprises me, you know? \n\nThanks for helping me work through this. I feel like I have a clearer direction now, which honestly, I wasn't expecting when I first reached out.",
  "system9": "Three weeks. You've got your compass. Trust what emerges.",
  "user9": "I hear you. Three weeks, intentions locked in, no pressure to become someone else\u2014just see what shows up. I can work with that.\n\nHonestly, I appreciate you not trying to sell me some transformation fantasy. This feels... real. Which is kind of refreshing, actually.",
  "system10": "That's the work. Trust your process.",
  "user10": "I hear you. Thanks for holding space for this\u2014it's been more grounded than I expected. Let's see where this goes.",
  "system11": "You're set. See what comes.",
  "user11": "I hear you. Three intentions, phone reminder, three weeks\u2014I'm good to go. Thanks for helping me get clearer on this.",
  "system12": "You're ready. Trust your compass.",
  "user12": "Got it. Three weeks, intentions locked, phone reminder set. I'm ready to see what actually emerges when I'm not managing everything so tightly. Thanks for the clarity.",
  "system13": "Solid work. Let the medicine show you what you need to see.",
  "user13": "I hear you. Three weeks, intentions set, reminder in place. I'm actually curious to see what shows up when I'm not trying to control every outcome. Thanks for the grounded approach\u2014this feels doable.",
  "system14": "You're set. Trust what surfaces.",
  "user14": "Got it. Intentions locked, three-week marker, reminder set. I'll keep my eyes open for what surfaces without trying to force some big breakthrough. Thanks for keeping this real.",
  "system15": "You're ready. Let it unfold.",
  "user15": "Three weeks, intentions set, reminder active. I\u2019m stepping back from trying to script what happens next\u2014ready to see what actually unfolds.",
  "system16": "You're ready. Let the experience show you what matters.",
  "user16": "Got it. Three weeks, intentions clear, reminder set. I'll let the experience show me what actually matters instead of deciding in advance. Thanks for the grounded approach.",
  "system17": "You're all set. Trust what comes.",
  "user17": "Three weeks, intentions locked, reminder on. I'll trust whatever surfaces without trying to force a storyline. Thanks for keeping it simple.",
  "system18": "Good work. Let the medicine do its job.",
  "user18": "Intentions written, reminder set for three weeks, and I\u2019m letting the medicine steer\u2014no script, just curiosity.",
  "system19": "Perfect. Stay curious and let it lead.",
  "user19": "Three-week reminder set, intentions clear, curiosity engaged\u2014letting the medicine lead wherever it wants to go. Thanks for the steady hand."
