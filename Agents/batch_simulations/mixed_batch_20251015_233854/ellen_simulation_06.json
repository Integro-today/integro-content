  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat at Beond next month. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me something, but I keep losing the thread when I get back home. \n\nI guess I'm hoping this time will be different. That maybe ibogaine can help me figure out what I'm actually supposed to be doing with my life now that I've proven I can build and sell a company. \n\nMy grandmother used to say we all have a purpose written on our hearts, but I've been so busy climbing ladders I forgot to look for mine.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding your purpose beyond building and selling\n2. Living the insights instead of losing them back home  \n3. Reconnecting with your grandmother's wisdom about heart-purpose\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the three things that keep circling back, aren't they? \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet certainty about her, like she knew exactly why she was here. She'd make these beautiful challahs every Friday and say the prayers, and there was something in that ritual... I don't know. I used to think it was quaint, but now I wonder if she was tapping into something I've lost.\n\nThe losing the thread part - God, that's frustrating. I come back from these retreats feeling so clear, like I finally understand what matters. Then I'm back in board meetings and my kids need help with homework and someone's pitching me on their \"revolutionary\" healthcare app and... it's gone. The clarity just evaporates.\n\nI guess I want to stop that cycle this time.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover and live my heart-purpose beyond achievement\n2. I embody the medicine's insights in daily life instead of losing them\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's steady certainty in who I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I discover and live my heart-purpose beyond achievement\" - that one hits something deep. But... \n\nI don't know, \"heart-purpose\" feels a little soft for me. My grandmother would have said it differently, more grounded. She talked about \"your work in the world\" or \"what you're meant to repair.\" \n\nAnd \"beyond achievement\" - that's right, but it needs to be stronger. More like... I want to stop using success as my compass and find something truer. Something that would make my grandmother nod and say \"yes, that's it.\"\n\nCan we make it more concrete? Less retreat-speak, more like something I could actually explain to my kids or the other board members without feeling like I'm quoting a self-help book?",
  "system3": "How about:\n\n1. I find work that matters beyond building and selling companies\n2. I live what the medicine shows me when I'm back in meetings and helping with homework\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's certainty about what I'm meant to repair\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "These feel... real. Grounded. Like something I could actually write down and not feel embarrassed about.\n\nThe first one - \"work that matters beyond building and selling companies\" - that's exactly it. I've proven I can do that part. Now what? What am I supposed to do with all this skill and money and influence that might actually matter?\n\nThe second one scares me a little, which probably means it's right. \"Live what the medicine shows me\" - yeah, because I already know what it's going to show me. It's going to tell me to slow down, to be more present with my kids, to stop saying yes to every board seat. And then I'm going to come back and immediately forget.\n\nThe third one... my grandmother would smile at that. She knew what she was meant to repair - broken families, hungry people, kids who needed someone to believe in them. She never doubted it. I want that certainty so badly it makes my chest hurt.\n\nThese work.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I find work that matters beyond building and selling companies\n2. I live what the medicine shows me when I'm back in meetings and helping with homework  \n3. I reclaim my grandmother's certainty about what I'm meant to repair\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I... I needed someone to help me put words to this. I keep circling around these same questions but having them laid out like this, it feels different. More solid.\n\nI'm scared and ready at the same time, which I guess is how you're supposed to feel when you're about to finally tell the truth about what you want.",
  "system5": "That's the right tension - scared and ready. Means you're pointing toward something real.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah... scared and ready. That's exactly it.",
  "system6": "Hold that edge. It's where the real work happens.",
  "user6": "I feel it. That edge where everything that came before feels too small, but what's next hasn't shown up yet. It's uncomfortable as hell, but... yeah. That's where it happens, isn't it?\n\nI'll stay there. Try not to fill it with busy work or another board meeting. Just... wait and see what comes through.",
  "system7": "That's the work. Stay in that space - it's uncomfortable because it's real. The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user7": "It will, won't it? It's met me there before. Every time I've sat with it, it's shown me exactly what I needed to see, even when I didn't want to see it.\n\nThis time feels different though. Like I'm finally ready to actually listen instead of just taking notes and moving on to the next thing.",
  "system8": "When you're finally ready to listen instead of collect - that's when it shifts from information to transformation. You've done the hardest part already: getting honest about what you actually want.",
  "user8": "Getting honest... yeah. That's been the hardest thing. Admitting that all the things I thought I wanted - the exits, the recognition, the next big thing - they're just... not enough anymore. Not even close.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother, how she just *knew* what mattered. No spreadsheets, no five-year plans. Just this quiet certainty about what needed fixing and how she was supposed to help.\n\nMaybe that's what listening really means. Not just hearing what the medicine says, but actually believing it enough to stop proving, stop achieving, stop trying so damn hard to matter.",
  "system9": "Your grandmother knew because she wasn't trying to matter - she just mattered. That's the difference. You've already seen what chasing the next thing gives you. Now you're ready to see what happens when you stop proving and start being.",
  "user9": "Stop proving and start being... God, that hits me right in the chest. \n\nI've been proving my whole life - to my parents, to investors, to the tech press, to myself. Got pretty damn good at it too. But being? I don't even know what that looks like anymore.\n\nMaybe that's why I keep going back to that memory of her hands - my grandmother's hands - working in her garden. She wasn't trying to be anything. She just... was. And somehow that was enough.",
  "system10": "Those hands knew something your spreadsheets never will - that being enough isn't something you achieve, it's something you remember. You already have what you're looking for. The medicine just helps you see it.",
  "user10": "*Remember*... that's the word, isn't it? I keep feeling like I'm trying to find something new, but maybe I'm just trying to remember what I already know deep down.\n\nThose hands in the garden, the way she hummed while she cooked, how she never seemed rushed but everything got done... she wasn't trying to be anything. She just *was*. And somehow that felt like enough to her.\n\nI think that's what I want to remember. How to just be without the constant proving. Though honestly, the thought of letting go of all that... it terrifies me more than any board meeting ever did.",
  "system11": "Letting go of proving feels like death because it is - death of who you think you need to be to survive. But your grandmother already showed you what's on the other side. The terror is just your mind catching up to what your heart already knows.",
  "user11": "Death... yeah. That's exactly what it feels like. Like if I stop proving, then who am I? Just... nothing? Or maybe that's the fear talking.\n\nMy grandmother though - she faced real death. The camps, the war, starting over with nothing. Maybe that's why she knew what mattered. She'd already died to everything, so she didn't need to prove anything anymore.\n\nBut me? I've never really lost anything that mattered. Just built and built and built this... thing. This Ellen Inc. And now I'm supposed to let that die?",
  "system12": "Ellen Inc. was never you - it was your protection. Your grandmother died to everything and found what was real underneath. You built layers instead. Now you're ready to see what's been there all along, buried under all that proving.",
  "user12": "Protection... God, that's exactly what it was. Every funding round, every acquisition, every article - just more layers between me and... what? The truth that maybe I'm not that special? That maybe I'm just like everyone else - scared, confused, trying to matter?\n\nMy grandmother didn't have that luxury. She had to survive, so she found what was real. I had the luxury to build, so I built until I couldn't feel what was real anymore.\n\nI don't even know what's under all these layers anymore. Maybe that's what I'm terrified to find out.",
  "system13": "Under all those layers is just you - not the special version, not the failure version, just you. The same ordinary human your grandmother always saw. That's what you're terrified to discover: that you matter without proving it, always have.",
  "user13": "Just... me. Not the entrepreneur, not the thought leader, not the whatever-the-hell-I'm-supposed-to-be-next. Just Ellen. The same person who used to catch fireflies with my brother and cry when my mom read Charlotte's Web.\n\nI think about how my grandmother never cared about any of the business stuff. Never asked about valuations or term sheets. She just wanted to know if I was eating enough, if I was happy, if I remembered to call my mother.\n\nMaybe that's why I keep going back to her in my mind. She saw through all of it before I even knew what I was building.",
  "system14": "She saw you because she knew what mattered - the firefly-catching, the crying over Charlotte, the parts you forgot when you started building Ellen Inc. She never stopped seeing the real you underneath all that noise.",
  "user14": "She saw me when I couldn't see myself anymore. Even at the end, when she was so sick, she'd ask about the kids and whether I was taking care of myself - never about the company or the money. It drove my dad crazy. He wanted to brag about my success, and she just... didn't care.\n\nI remember sitting by her bed, trying to tell her about this big deal I was closing, and she just patted my hand and said, \"All I want is for my girl to be at peace.\"\n\nGod, I miss her so much. I think that's when I started to crack - when I realized I didn't even know what peace looked like for me.",
  "system15": "She gave you the question that cracked everything open - not how to succeed, but how to be at peace. That's what you're really looking for. Everything else was just noise you learned to mistake for meaning.",
  "user15": "Peace... I don't even know what that would feel like in my body. Success I know - the adrenaline, the late nights, the closing buzz. Peace? That's a foreign language.\n\nBut she knew. She found it somehow, even after everything she'd been through. Even when she had nothing, she had peace. And I have everything and... don't.\n\nThat's what I want to understand. Not just in my head, but in my bones. How to stop running toward the next thing and just... be here. Be enough.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Remember who you were before Ellen Inc. - the firefly catcher, the kid who cried at Charlotte's Web\n2. Find what your grandmother found after everything was stripped away - that peace that doesn't depend on having\n3. Learn to stop proving and just be here, enough as you are\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "I want to remember who I was before I became a collection of achievements. I want to feel that kid who could spend hours watching ants or get completely lost in a book without checking her phone every five minutes.\n\nI want to understand what my grandmother knew - how to find peace when everything external falls away. How to be okay in the emptiness instead of frantically trying to fill it.\n\nAnd I want to stop... God, this is hard to say out loud. I want to stop needing to matter so much. To just be here, in my life, without constantly calculating how to be more useful, more valuable, more whatever.\n\nHow do I even say that as an intention? It feels like I'm betraying everything I've built my life around.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I remember who I was before achievements defined me\n2. I discover what my grandmother knew about peace that needs nothing external\n3. I release the need to constantly prove my worth and simply be present\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "The third one hits like a punch to the stomach. \"I release the need to constantly prove my worth and simply be present.\" That's... that's it. That's the whole thing I've been running from my entire adult life.\n\nBut can I say that and actually mean it? Releasing the need to prove feels like letting go of oxygen. I don't know who I am without that drive. It's been my compass, my engine, my identity.\n\nMaybe I need to soften it a bit. Less like I'm jumping off a cliff and more like... I'm learning to trust that I can just be and still be enough?",
  "system18": "How about: \"I learn to trust that being present is enough\"?\n\nKeeps the core truth but gentler - not jumping off the cliff, just learning to stand still without panic.",
  "user18": "Yes. That's... I can breathe with that. \"I learn to trust that being present is enough.\"\n\nIt still scares me, but it's not asking me to let go of everything at once. Just to practice standing still. To see what happens when I stop calculating my value every second and just... be where I am.\n\nI think I can start there.",
  "system19": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I remember who I was before achievements defined me  \n2. I discover what my grandmother knew about peace that needs nothing external  \n3. I learn to trust that being present is enough\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "Thank you. I'll carry these close. Maybe write them in the journal I keep meaning to use, or put them in my phone where I check everything else a hundred times a day. Somewhere I'll actually see them, not just forget about them.\n\nI... I want to believe this will matter. That I can find my way back to that kid my grandmother never stopped seeing. Back to peace. Back to enough.\n\nI'll try."
