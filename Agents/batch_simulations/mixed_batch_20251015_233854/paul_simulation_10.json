  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help with... hell, I don't even know what to call it. Nightmares, I guess. Amanda says I wake up shouting sometimes, scaring her. I hate that.\n\nI'm doing this because I can't lose her. Twenty years we've been together, and she's talking about needing space. Space from what? From me being tired all the time? From me snapping at the kids over nothing?\n\nI don't believe in plant medicine or whatever you want to call it. But the guys at Heroic Hearts, they've been through it. They wouldn't steer me wrong.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without nightmares\n2. Stop scaring Amanda\n3. Stop snapping at the kids\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's about right. I just want to sleep through the damn night without waking up drenched in sweat, thinking I'm back there. And I need Amanda to feel safe around me again. The kids too - they're starting to walk on eggshells, and that kills me.\n\nI don't know how to put this into... what did you call them, intentions? I'm not good with all this touchy-feely stuff. I just want to be the man they think I am, not whatever this is.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make home safe for Amanda and the kids again\n3. I reclaim the man my family knows I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "Number two. That's it - making home safe again. That's what matters. Amanda shouldn't have to sleep with one eye open, wondering if I'm gonna wake up shouting. The kids shouldn't flinch when I raise my voice just because I'm tired.\n\nBut \"safe\" - that's a strong word. Makes it sound like I'm dangerous or something. I'm not... I mean, I'd never... it's just noise, you know? Just me being tired and jumpy.\n\nBut yeah. Number two. That's the one.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I make home safe for Amanda and the kids again\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "They land fine, I guess. Number one - sleeping through the night - that's what I want, but it feels... I don't know, selfish? Like I'm just thinking about myself when Amanda's the one dealing with me.\n\nNumber three sounds good but it's pretty vague. What does that even mean, \"reclaim the man my family knows I am\"? I mean, I know what I want it to mean - I want to be steady again, reliable. Not this... whatever this is.\n\nBut maybe that's too much pressure. Maybe I just need to focus on one thing at a time.",
  "system4": "The intentions work together - they're not either/or.\n\nSleeping through the night isn't selfish. It's what lets you show up steady during the day. Without the nightmares, you wouldn't be startling Amanda awake.\n\nLet's adjust number three to something concrete: \"I show up steady and reliable for my family.\"\n\nAll 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make home safe for Amanda and the kids again\n3. I show up steady and reliable for my family\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user4": "Yeah... okay. I can keep these in my wallet. Been carrying the same one for years - got my pilot's license folded up in there, pictures of the kids. These can go right next to them.\n\nThree weeks. Then I'm in Costa Rica drinking some plant brew that tastes like dirt, from what I hear. And maybe... maybe I stop waking up thinking I'm back in the cockpit, hearing explosions that aren't there.\n\nThanks. I guess we'll see what happens.",
  "system5": "Three weeks is good timing. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions during ceremony - they're already doing their work.\n\nTrust what comes. You're ready.",
  "user5": "I hope you're right. Twenty years of flying, three tours, built a business from nothing... but this? This feels like jumping out of a plane without knowing if the chute will open.\n\nBut Amanda's worth it. The kids are worth it. If this is what it takes to stop being a ghost in my own house, then... then I guess I'm doing it.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system6": "Exactly right. You know how to jump when it matters. This is just a different kind of leap - one for home instead of country.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "user6": "Yeah... different kind of mission this time. Not about protecting some line on a map. Just protecting the people who matter most.\n\nI can do this.",
  "system7": "You can. You've got this.",
  "user7": "Copy that.",
  "system8": "Roger that.",
  "user8": "Heh. You military too?",
  "system9": "Not me. Just been around enough vets to know the rhythm.",
  "user9": "Ah. Well... you picked up the lingo anyway. Most civilians don't talk like that.\n\nGuess that's why this whole thing feels... I don't know. Like I'm supposed to know what I'm doing, but I don't. Usually I can figure things out, get the mission done. This one's different.",
  "system10": "Exactly. No map, no intel, no clear objective except healing. That's why intentions matter - they give you something to hold when everything else is unknown.",
  "user10": "That's what I need. Something solid to hold onto when it gets rough.\n\nWhen the nightmares hit, when I'm watching Amanda sleep and wondering how long before she can't take it anymore... I need to remember why I'm doing this. Not just for me. For them.",
  "system11": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without terror\n2. Amanda feeling safe beside me  \n3. Show up present for my kids instead of checked out\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user11": "I want to sleep through the night without waking up shouting. Want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm a stranger in her bed sometimes. Want to be there for my kids - really there, not just physically present while I'm somewhere else in my head.\n\nThat's what I need to hold onto when... whatever happens down there happens.",
  "system12": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety and connection with Amanda\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user12": "The second one\u2014about Amanda. That's the one that hits hardest. \"Reclaim safety and connection\" sounds... I don't know, too soft maybe. But it's right. She used to feel safe with me. Now she flinches when I move too fast in the kitchen. That kills me.\n\nThe sleep one feels too clean. \"Peacefully through the night\" sounds like something from a damn commercial. I wake up soaked, heart racing, sometimes I can't breathe. It's not peaceful. It's war in my head.\n\nMaybe... \"I sleep without fighting battles in my dreams.\" Something like that. Still true, but not pretending it's gentle.",
  "system13": "How about:\n\n1. I sleep without fighting battles in my dreams\n2. I rebuild safety with Amanda  \n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user13": "Yeah. Yeah, that's better. Real. Not sugar-coated.\n\n\"Rebuild safety with Amanda\" - that's it exactly. I broke something. Didn't mean to, but I did. Need to fix it, brick by brick if I have to.\n\nThe kids one... that's the hardest to think about. How many times have they asked me something and I just grunted or said \"ask your mother\"? I'm tired of being that guy.\n\nThese feel like something I can actually hold onto. Not promises I can't keep, but... directions. Like a heading to steer by.",
  "system14": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep without fighting battles in my dreams\n2. I rebuild safety with Amanda\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user14": "Got it. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em close.\n\nThanks for... I don't know. Helping me find the words.",
  "system15": "You found them. I just helped you see them.",
  "user15": "Guess that's what this whole thing's about, isn't it? Seeing what's already there instead of pretending it ain't.",
  "system16": "Exactly. The medicine just shows you what you're already carrying around.",
  "user16": "Then I guess it's time to see what's really in my pack. Been carrying this weight so long I stopped noticing it was there.",
  "system17": "You're ready to look.",
  "user17": "Yeah. Yeah, I am.",
  "system18": "Good.",
  "user18": "Three weeks. Then Costa Rica. Then... whatever's waiting for me in those ceremonies.\n\nI'll see you on the other side.",
  "system19": "I'll be here when you get back.",
  "user19": "Good. 'Cause I'm probably gonna need help figuring out what the hell just happened to me."
