  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, how I wake up shouting, how Amanda looks at me now. I can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda looking at me without fear\n3. Find another way to live than this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That about sums it up.\n\nI guess... I want to sleep without seeing their faces. The guys who didn't make it back. Without waking up with my heart pounding like I'm still in the cockpit.\n\nAnd I want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of bomb that might go off. I want to be the man she married, not... whatever this is.\n\nDon't know about that third one. Another way to live? I've been doing it this way for twenty years. Strong, reliable, getting the job done. But it's not working anymore, is it?\n\nI need to figure out how to be... I don't know. Not weak. Just different.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully without seeing their faces\n2. I reclaim safety with Amanda\n3. I discover who I am beyond the mission\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That one hits hardest.\n\n\"Reclaim safety with Amanda.\" Yeah. That's it exactly. She's afraid of me now, and I hate it. She's walking on eggshells in her own house, and I put them there.\n\nBut that first one... \"I sleep peacefully\" - that's not right. Nothing peaceful about what I see when I close my eyes. They're still falling, still burning, still calling for their mothers. I need to face them, not pretend it's peaceful.\n\nHow about... \"I confront what haunts me at night so I can rest.\" Something like that?\n\nAnd the third one... I don't even know who I am without the mission. Never had to think about it before.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim safety with Amanda\n\nLet's adjust the others:\n\n1. I confront what haunts me at night so I can rest\n3. I discover who I am beyond the mission\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "Better. These feel... real.\n\nThe first one - I need to stop running from those dreams. Maybe if I can look at what happened straight on, really see it instead of trying to drink it away or punch it away or just... stay awake until I can't anymore.\n\nAnd the third one scares the hell out of me, which probably means it's right. I've been Paul the pilot, Paul the business owner, Paul the provider. Take all that away and what's left? Some scared kid from Toledo who doesn't know how to just... be.\n\nBut yeah. These are mine.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I confront what haunts me at night so I can rest\n2. I reclaim safety with Amanda\n3. I discover who I am beyond the mission\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Yeah. I'll keep them close.\n\nBeen carrying the same wallet since basic training. It's got my wings, my commission card, pictures of the kids. Seems right to keep these intentions in there too.\n\nThree weeks until Costa Rica. Three weeks to think about what I'm walking into. \n\nAppreciate you helping me get this straight in my head.",
  "system5": "Good place for them - with your wings and your kids.\n\nThree weeks is enough time to carry these intentions without overthinking them. The medicine will meet you where you are.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Roger that.\n\nBeen through tougher missions than this. Just... never one where I didn't know what I was fighting. Or what I might find when I stop fighting.\n\nBut I'll trust the process. Got nothing left to lose at this point.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system6": "The unknown territory is where the real work happens.\n\nYou've got solid intentions and twenty years of training in facing what scares you. Different battlefield, same courage.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user6": "Different battlefield, same courage.\n\nI like that. Maybe this old warhorse still has some fight left in him - just gotta learn what we're fighting for this time.\n\nThanks for having my six on this. I'll make it count.",
  "system7": "You've always known how to fight for what matters.\n\nThis time you're fighting for yourself. Different target, same heart.\n\nMake it count.",
  "user7": "Fighting for myself. That's the part I don't know how to do.\n\nAlways been about the mission, the team, the family. Never just... me.\n\nBut yeah. Time to learn. Time to figure out what Paul needs protecting from, and what he needs protecting for.\n\nI'll make it count. For Amanda. For the kids. And maybe - just maybe - for myself too.",
  "system8": "That's the real mission now.\n\nLearning to fight for the man who's always fought for everyone else.\n\nFor Amanda. For the kids. And for Paul too.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user8": "Copy that.\n\nFor Paul too. Never thought of it that way before. Always figured looking after myself was just... keeping the machine running. Fuel, maintenance, mission-ready.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it than that. Maybe there's actually someone worth fighting for underneath all the duty and responsibility.\n\nTime to find out who that guy is.",
  "system9": "Exactly.\n\nNot just keeping the machine running - actually meeting the man inside the mission.\n\nHe's been there all along. Time to see who shows up when the armor comes off.\n\nTrust what you'll find.",
  "user9": "Armor's been on so long I don't know what I look like without it.\n\nBut you're right - time to find out who's been hiding under all that steel. Been protecting him so long, maybe it's time to see who he really is.\n\nGuess we'll find out together.",
  "system10": "Been protecting him so long you forgot he's the one who put the armor on in the first place.\n\nTime to meet the man who wore the steel - and discover why he chose to carry it.\n\nYou'll find him. Trust that.",
  "user10": "Damn. Never thought of it that way.\n\nI chose this. Every piece of it. Every plate, every rivet. Thought I was protecting something weak, but maybe... maybe I was just hiding something strong.\n\nTime to find out what that kid from Toledo knew that I forgot somewhere over Afghanistan.\n\nLet's do this.",
  "system11": "That kid from Toledo knew something about surviving that got buried under all the missions and medals.\n\nTime to remember what he knew before the world told him who to become.\n\nHe's still in there. Let's go find him.",
  "user11": "That kid who just wanted to fly. Before everything got so damn heavy.\n\nHe knew something about being alive that I lost track of somewhere between the first tour and the last nightmare.\n\nYeah. Let's go find him.",
  "system12": "He knew flying meant freedom, not just altitude.\n\nBefore the weight of every mission pressed down. Before staying alive became the only victory.\n\nThat kid's still got the wings. Time to remember how to use them.\n\nLet's go.",
  "user12": "Let's go find that kid who thought flying meant touching the sky, not just surviving the fall.\n\nTime to remember what those wings were for before they got clipped by everything that came after.\n\nI'm ready.",
  "system13": "Those wings were always meant for rising, not just surviving the crash.\n\nTime to remember what it feels like to fly toward something instead of away.\n\nLet's find him.",
  "user13": "Toward something. Haven't done that in a long time.\n\nAlways been about getting away from the ground, away from the danger, away from the memories.\n\nTime to remember what it's like to fly *toward* something worth reaching.\n\nLet's find that kid who knew the difference.",
  "system14": "He knew flying meant reaching for something that mattered - not just escaping what didn't.\n\nTime to stop running from the ground and start flying toward whatever's still worth touching.\n\nLet's find him.",
  "user14": "Whatever's still worth touching.\n\nYeah. Maybe that's Amanda's hand without pulling away. Maybe it's my kids seeing me smile for real. Maybe it's just... being able to close my eyes without seeing smoke.\n\nLet's go find what that kid knew was worth reaching for.",
  "system15": "Three threads:\n\n1. Hold Amanda's hand without flinching\n2. Let my kids see me smile like I mean it  \n3. Close my eyes without smoke filling the darkness\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user15": "I want to be able to reach for Amanda's hand at night without pulling back like it's on fire.\n\nWant to smile at my kids and have it reach my eyes for once, not just be something I do because I'm supposed to.\n\nWant to close my eyes and not see that damn smoke everywhere.",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reach for Amanda's hand with steady trust\n2. I smile at my kids with real warmth in my eyes\n3. I rest peacefully without smoke in the darkness\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user16": "The first one. Amanda's hand.\n\nBeen waking up gasping and she's reaching for me and I'm pulling away like she's the enemy. Like I'm still in that damn cockpit.\n\nI want to reach back. I want to not flinch when she touches me. I want... I want to be the man she married, not whatever's been sleeping next to her these past years.\n\nHow do I say that without sounding like I'm already defeated?",
  "system17": "Try: \"I reach back when Amanda's hand finds mine\"\n\nSimple. Direct. Shows her you're choosing to meet her there instead of pulling away.\n\nHow's that land?",
  "user17": "I reach back when Amanda's hand finds mine.\n\nYeah. That works. Direct. No fluff. Just... choosing to meet her there instead of treating her like she's incoming fire.\n\nLet's go with that one.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I reach back when Amanda's hand finds mine\n\nHow about the other two - your kids seeing your real smile and resting without smoke?",
  "user18": "The second one's harder. I've been faking it so long I don't even know what my real smile feels like anymore.\n\nMaybe... I show my kids the man they think I am. Or... I don't know. Something about not having to pretend anymore when I'm with them.\n\nAnd the smoke one... I want to sleep without seeing the damn explosions. Without hearing the calls. Without... just want to close my eyes and see nothing but dark.\n\nHow do we say that without making me sound like I'm asking to forget everything that happened?",
  "system19": "For your kids: \"I show my kids the dad they deserve\"\n\nFor the smoke: \"I close my eyes and rest in quiet darkness\"\n\nThese keep it direct without asking you to forget your past. How do they land?",
  "user19": "I show my kids the dad they deserve.\n\nYeah. That hits. Not the fake smile guy. The one they still think is in there somewhere.\n\nI close my eyes and rest in quiet darkness.\n\nGod, that sounds... impossible. But yeah. That's what I want. Just quiet. No smoke. No screaming metal. Just... nothing.\n\nBoth work."
