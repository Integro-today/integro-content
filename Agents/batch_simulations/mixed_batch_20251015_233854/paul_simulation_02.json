  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, how I wake up shouting, how Amanda looks at me like she's walking on eggshells. I can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without waking up shouting\n2. Amanda moves freely without fear\n3. Find steadiness instead of living on edge\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the things. When I wake up and she's not in bed anymore\u2014she's sleeping in the guest room most nights now\u2014I just... I hate that I did that to her. To us.\n\nI need to stop scaring my own wife in the middle of the damn night. That's what it comes down to.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Amanda feels safe sleeping beside me again\n3. I release the tension that drives me from bed\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I don't know... \"release the tension\" sounds like something my therapist would say. No offense, but I need something that doesn't make me feel like I'm already broken.\n\nThe second one. Amanda sleeping beside me again. That's what matters. But I need it to feel like something I can actually do, not just wish for.",
  "system3": "Got it. How about:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. I make our bed feel safe for Amanda again\n3. I trust my body to rest instead of react\n\nBetter?",
  "user3": "The second one's good. \"I make our bed feel safe for Amanda again.\" That feels like something I can actually work toward.\n\nThe other two... \"peacefully\" and \"trust my body\" - I don't know. Those feel too soft. Like I'm supposed to just magically stop being on alert all the time. Doesn't work like that.",
  "system4": "How about:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without startling awake\n2. I make our bed feel safe for Amanda again\n3. I stay grounded when my body wants to fight\n\nThat feel more solid?",
  "user4": "Yeah. Those feel like something I can actually do. Not asking me to be all peaceful or trusting - just... stay grounded. Sleep through. Make it safe for her again.\n\nI can work with that.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without startling awake\n2. I make our bed feel safe for Amanda again  \n3. I stay grounded when my body wants to fight\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks.",
  "system6": "Solid plan. The wallet's been through everything with you - these intentions will travel well there.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "Yeah. We'll see what happens when I get down there. Never thought I'd be doing something like this, but... here we are.\n\nAppreciate you walking through it with me.",
  "system7": "You're welcome. The medicine meets you where you are - not where you think you should be.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "I'll try to remember that. When I'm down there and things get... whatever they get.\n\nThree weeks. Then I find out what this plant stuff can actually do.",
  "system8": "Three weeks. The intentions are set - they'll do their work whether you remember them or not.\n\nLet the plant show you what you need to see.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Whatever needs to come up, I guess. Just hope I don't lose it completely down there.",
  "system9": "You won't lose yourself. The medicine shows you what's real - doesn't take you away from it.\n\nYour intentions are anchored. Trust that.",
  "user9": "Alright. I'll hold onto that. Got enough to worry about without adding more to the pile.",
  "system10": "Exactly. Keep it simple. You've got what you need.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user10": "Copy that.",
  "system11": "*Understood*",
  "user11": "Roger that.",

  "user16": "I'm doing this Heroic Hearts program in a few weeks. Never done anything like this before\u2014don't even like taking aspirin. But Amanda says I either get help or... I don't know. I can't lose her.",
  "system17": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user17": "I wake up most nights soaked in sweat, yelling about stuff I can't even remember when I'm awake. Amanda says I scare her. I scare my kids sometimes too, though they don't say it. I just... I need to be able to sleep through the night without being angry all the time.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Stop scaring Amanda and the kids  \n3. Let go of the constant anger\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "I don't know how to say this without sounding like... I don't know. All I know is I can't keep waking up like I'm still in the cockpit, feeling like I gotta fight my way out of bed. Need to find a way to shut that off without becoming some... I don't know what. I just want to be the man my family thinks I am when the lights are off.",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without fighting\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and my kids\n3. I become the man my family believes I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The second one. I need to reclaim safety for Amanda and the kids. That's it. That's what matters. I can handle waking up tired\u2014hell, I been doing that for years. But I can't handle them being scared of me. That can't happen anymore."
