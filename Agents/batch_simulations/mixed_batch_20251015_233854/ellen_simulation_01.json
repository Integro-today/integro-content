  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and I want to do this right. I've done other medicines before\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA\u2014but this one feels different. Heavier maybe. \n\nI've been searching for something since I sold my company. Built this whole healthcare data business, scaled it, sold it before forty... and then just felt hollow. Like I'd climbed the wrong mountain. I've been trying to find my way back to something real, something that matters. My grandmother's faith keeps calling to me\u2014she was into Jewish mysticism, had this deep spiritual life that I think I abandoned when I chose the startup world.\n\nI guess I'm hoping ibogaine will help me figure out what my next chapter should be. Not just another business win, but something that actually contributes. Something that leaves the world better.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond business wins\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's spiritual depth\n3. Discovering how to contribute something meaningful\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are the threads I've been circling around. It's like... I keep coming back to this question of whether I've abandoned something important in pursuit of all these external achievements. My grandmother would light candles every Friday, and I remember watching her pray with this total devotion that seemed to connect her to something bigger than all the business metrics I live and breathe.\n\nI want to understand what she knew that I've forgotten. And I want to stop building things just to build them, you know? I need to figure out how to use everything I've learned to actually serve something meaningful. Not just profitable.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I remember what my grandmother knew about devotion to something greater\n2. I build only what serves meaning, not just profit\n3. I use my skills to contribute something that matters\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "It's the first one that hits me hardest. I keep thinking about her face when she prayed\u2014like she was plugged into something I can't even access anymore. But I want to go deeper than just remembering what she knew. I want to feel it, embody it. \n\nWhat about: \"I reconnect with the devotion my grandmother carried, opening to the mystery she accessed through candlelight and prayer.\"\n\nThe second one feels too... business school or something. Like I'm still trying to optimize when really I want to completely shift how I operate in the world. Build feels like the wrong word entirely. Maybe more like: \"I align my work with what nourishes humanity, releasing the compulsion to achieve for achievement's sake.\"\n\nAnd the third... I don't know. Still feels like I'm trying too hard to be useful. Maybe that's just who I am\u2014always trying to justify my worth through contribution.",
  "system3": "I hear you on the business school feel. Let's shift it:\n\n1. I reconnect with the devotion my grandmother accessed through candlelight and prayer\n2. I release achievement for achievement's sake, aligning with what nourishes humanity\n3. I trust my worth beyond what I contribute\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "The first one\u2014yes. It makes my chest tight in that way that tells me it's hitting something real. I can almost smell the candles from her house, feel the warmth of that small dining room where everything felt sacred.\n\nThe second one feels... closer. But \"nourishes humanity\" sounds like something I'd put in a company mission statement. What about just \"I release achievement for achievement's sake, aligning with what feels sacred and true\"? Because that's what I'm really after, isn't it? Not some grand contribution but the sense that what I'm doing is aligned with something deeper.\n\nThe third one\u2014ouch. That's the one that scares me most. What if I stop producing, stop achieving, and there's nothing there? Just emptiness. But maybe that's exactly why I need it.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I reconnect with the devotion my grandmother accessed through candlelight and prayer\n2. I release achievement for achievement's sake, aligning with what feels sacred and true\n3. I trust my worth beyond what I contribute\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down\u2014keep them in my wallet like you said. Been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.\n\nI feel... I don't know. Lighter maybe? Like I've been trying to solve the wrong problem this whole time, thinking I needed to find the next big thing instead of just... coming home to something that's been waiting for me.\n\nI'll see this through. All of it.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine will meet you where you're going.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I will. And thank you\u2014for helping me find words for what I've been circling around for years. I'll carry these with me, not just into the ceremony but into whatever comes next.\n\nI'll trust it. Finally.",
  "system6": "You're ready.",
  "user6": "I am.",
  "system7": "Solid compass.",
  "user7": "Yeah. It finally feels like true north.",
  "system8": "Trust it.",
  "user8": "I do. Finally, I do.",

  "user9": "I\u2019m ready. Thank you\u2014for holding the space, for the questions that cracked me open, for helping me name what I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ll carry this forward.",
