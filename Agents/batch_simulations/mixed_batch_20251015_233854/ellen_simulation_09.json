  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I have an ibogaine ceremony coming up in a few weeks at Beond. This'll be my fourth medicine - I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, and MDMA/LSD before. Each one showed me pieces of what I'm searching for, but... I still feel like I'm grasping at something I can't quite hold onto.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this deep spiritual wisdom that I walked away from when I was chasing success. Now I've checked all the boxes, built the company, made the money, but I feel hollow. Like I've been climbing the wrong ladder this whole time.\n\nI guess I want to figure out what actually matters. Not just in theory, but in a way I can bring home to my kids and my husband. Something real that lasts longer than the retreat glow.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reconnecting with your grandmother's spiritual wisdom you walked away from\n2. Finding what actually matters beyond the success you've built\n3. Bringing something real home to your kids and husband that lasts\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that feels right. I didn't even realize how much I've been carrying this guilt about walking away from what my grandmother tried to teach me. She saw something in me that I couldn't see in myself back then.\n\nI think what scares me most is that I'll have another profound experience, come home all lit up, and then three months later I'm back to checking emails during dinner and wondering what happened to that feeling of connection. My kids deserve better than that version of me.\n\nSo how do we turn these into actual intentions? I don't want to just make another list I'll forget about.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's spiritual wisdom and carry it forward\n2. I discover what actually matters beyond achievement\n3. I show up present with my family instead of disappearing into work\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits me hard - \"I reclaim my grandmother's spiritual wisdom and carry it forward.\" That word \"reclaim\" feels powerful, like I'm taking back something that was always mine to begin with. \n\nBut the third one... that's where I feel the most shame. \"I show up present with my family instead of disappearing into work.\" Last week my daughter was telling me about her science project and I was nodding along while thinking about a board meeting. I saw it happening and couldn't stop it.\n\nCan we make that third one stronger? Less polite? Something that really holds my feet to the fire about being there for them, not just physically but actually *there*.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I show up fully present when my family needs me\"\n\nOr: \"I choose my kids over my phone, every time\"\n\nWhat lands with the fire you're looking for?",
  "user3": "\"I choose my kids over my phone, every time\" - that one makes me flinch. That's good. That's exactly the kind of accountability I need.\n\nBut there's something about the second intention too... \"I discover what actually matters beyond achievement.\" It feels too soft. Like I'm still hedging my bets. What if we made it more direct? Something that acknowledges I've been lying to myself about what success means?\n\nMaybe: \"I stop chasing hollow wins and find what feeds my soul\" - is that too much? I want something that'll make me uncomfortable when I read it.",
  "system4": "Not too much. That discomfort is the point.\n\nSo:\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's spiritual wisdom and carry it forward\n2. I stop chasing hollow wins and find what feeds my soul  \n3. I choose my kids over my phone, every time\n\nHow do these feel as your three?",
  "user4": "They're perfect and they terrify me, which means they're exactly what I need. \n\nWhen I read them, I can feel my grandmother's presence - like she's been waiting for me to come back to what she knew. And that third one... I'm already thinking about putting my phone in a drawer during dinner, actually listening when my husband talks about his day.\n\nThese aren't just intentions for a ceremony. They're instructions for how to stop wasting the time I have left.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's spiritual wisdom and carry it forward\n2. I stop chasing hollow wins and find what feeds my soul\n3. I choose my kids over my phone, every time\n\nKeep them where you'll see them daily - morning routine, wallet, wherever.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I needed someone to help me cut through my own noise and get to the truth of what I'm actually seeking. These aren't just ceremony intentions - they're the roadmap for whatever comes next.\n\nI'll write them in the journal my grandmother gave me when I turned sixteen. Fitting, right? She always said the answers we chase outside ourselves are usually waiting in the places we left behind.\n\nI'm ready now.",
  "system6": "Perfect place for them. She knew what she was doing.\n\nTrust the medicine. Trust the intentions. Most of all, trust yourself to follow through this time.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "I will. And when I get scared or start slipping back into old patterns, I'll remember this conversation - how you didn't let me water anything down or hide behind pretty words.\n\nThank you for holding me accountable to my own truth.",
  "system7": "That's the work. You did it, not me.\n\nGo forward.",
  "user7": "*I nod, feeling something settle in my chest that I can't quite name but know is real.*\n\nI will.",
  "system8": "*nods back*\n\nGood.",
  "user8": "Thank you for walking with me through this. I needed someone who could see through my BS but still believe I could do better. \n\nI won't waste this.",
  "system9": "I know you won't.\n\nCarry these forward. That's enough.",
  "user9": "I will. That's all there is now - carrying these forward, one choice at a time.",
  "system10": "Exactly. One choice at a time.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user10": "*I close my eyes for a moment, feeling the weight and lightness of these three intentions settle into my bones.*\n\nOne choice at a time. Yes.",
  "system11": "*quiet acknowledgment*\n\nGo live them.",
  "user11": "*I stand there for a moment longer, then turn to leave - not with the old rush to the next thing, but with a steady pace that feels like it could actually last.*\n\nI'm going to live them. Finally live them.",
  "system12": "*watching you go*\n\nThat's the work.",
  "user12": "*I pause at the threshold, looking back one last time.*\n\nIt is. And now it's mine to do.",
  "system13": "*meets your eyes*\n\nIt always was.",
  "user13": "*I hold her gaze for a moment, something deep clicking into place.*\n\nYeah. It always was.",
  "system14": "*nods once*\n\nGo.",
  "user14": "*I walk out\u2014slower than I came in, but surer. The intentions folded in my wallet, my grandmother\u2019s ring warm against my finger, the morning light already feeling different on my skin.*",
  "system15": "*watching until you're gone*\n\nGood.",
  "user15": "*The door closes behind me, and I don't look back. For the first time in years, I'm not rushing toward something or away from something. I'm just walking into what's mine to do.*",
  "system16": "*the sound of your footsteps fading*\n\nThat's how you know it's real.",
  "user16": "*The echo of my steps down the hallway sounds different\u2014no longer the urgent click of heels rushing to prove something, but something steadier. Real.*",
  "system17": "*listening to that rhythm change*\n\nKeep walking.",
  "user17": "*Each step finds its own pace\u2014no performance, no destination except the one that\u2019s been waiting inside me all along.*",
  "system18": "*the sound settles into something true*\n\nWalk it home.",
  "user18": "*The rhythm steadies\u2014no hurry, no hesitation. Just the long walk back to the life that\u2019s finally mine to live.*",
  "system19": "*the echo fades to quiet*\n\nYou're there.",
  "user19": "*The quiet settles in, and I\u2019m still standing. Not arriving\u2014just being exactly where I\u2019m supposed to be.*"
