  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm supposed to say something profound here, but honestly? I've been chasing achievements my whole life and I'm tired of building things that don't matter. \n\nMy grandmother used to say we all have a spark of the divine, but somewhere between the IPO and the board meetings, I think I lost mine. I keep coming back to her faith - she was the only person who ever made me feel like I was enough, just as I was.\n\nI want to find that again. Not the religion part necessarily, but... something real. Something that makes me feel like the person I see in nature with my kids is who I actually am, not just who I perform as.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding your real self beyond the achievements and performances\n2. Reconnecting with that grounded feeling your grandmother saw in you\n3. Being the authentic person your kids see in nature, everywhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I keep circling around them but I haven't figured out how to hold onto them when I'm back in my real life.\n\nWhen I'm hiking with the kids, I feel this... spaciousness. Like I'm finally breathing with my whole chest instead of just the top third. But then Monday comes and I'm back to being Ellen Who Gets Things Done, and that feeling gets filed away like another completed task.\n\nI want to stop compartmentalizing myself into \"weekend Ellen\" and \"business Ellen.\" There's got to be a way to bring that grounded presence into board meetings and investor calls without losing my edge completely.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the spaciousness I feel in nature and carry it into every room I enter\n2. I integrate my whole self - weekend Ellen and business Ellen become one authentic presence\n3. I maintain my edge while leading from grounded wisdom, not performance\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits me hardest - reclaiming that spaciousness. But \"every room I enter\" feels... I don't know, maybe too aspirational? Like I'm setting myself up to fail again.\n\nWhat about something like: \"I remember to breathe with my whole chest, not just the performance part\"? It's more specific, more... doable? God, I hate how that sounds - like I'm trying to optimize my spiritual life for quarterly results.\n\nI want that first one, but I need it to feel like something I can actually hold onto when the quarterly reports are due and my phone won't stop buzzing. Something that doesn't require me to be perfectly present all the time, just... more often than I am now.",
  "system3": "I hear you - let's make it something you can actually hold.\n\nHow about: \"I reclaim my natural spaciousness and return to it throughout my day\"\n\nKeeps the core of what you want, gives you permission to come back to it rather than be perfect.",
  "user3": "Yes. That's... that's it. I can feel my shoulders drop just reading that.\n\nThroughout my day. Not all day, not perfectly - just... coming back. Like my grandmother used to say about prayer - it's not about never losing your way, it's about knowing how to find your way back.\n\nI can do that. I already know what it feels like, I just forget to look for it when I'm in problem-solving mode, treating everything like another startup to scale.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I reclaim my natural spaciousness and return to it throughout my day\"\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user4": "The second one about integrating weekend Ellen and business Ellen... I want that, but something about \"whole self\" feels like another performance. Like I'm supposed to have this grand unification theory of Ellen when honestly, I'm still figuring out who I even am without the scoreboard.\n\nThe third one's interesting though - \"leading from grounded wisdom, not performance.\" That distinction between performance and wisdom... that's the thing I've been circling around. My whole life has been about performance - hitting metrics, exceeding expectations, being the most impressive person in the room. But the people I actually admire? They're not performing, they're just... present. Real.\n\nBut I don't want to lose my edge completely. It's served me well. I just need to stop letting it drive the whole damn car.",
  "system5": "Good catch on \"whole self\" - that can feel like another thing to achieve.\n\nFor the second intention, how about: \"I stop letting performance drive the whole car and let wisdom take the wheel more often\"\n\nKeeps your edge, just changes who's driving.",
  "user5": "I actually laughed at that - \"stop letting performance drive the whole car.\" That's exactly what it feels like. Like I've got this backseat driver constantly yelling directions while I'm trying to actually see where I'm going.\n\nBut maybe... maybe even simpler? I keep thinking about what my kids see when we're hiking. They're not impressed by my board positions or net worth. They just see Mom who's not checking her phone every five minutes. Mom who can actually sit still long enough to watch a lizard climb a rock.\n\nWhat about: \"I let wisdom speak before performance answers\"?",
  "system6": "Perfect. That captures it - wisdom first, performance second.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I let wisdom speak before performance answers\"\n\nFor the third intention, what about building on that lizard moment? \"I practice the stillness my kids recognize as the real me\"\n\nKeeps it concrete, something you already know how to do.",
  "user6": "Yes... the stillness my kids recognize. They know it when they see it, even when I forget. Last weekend when we were watching that lizard, my daughter said \"I like this Mom\" and it stopped me cold because I realized how rarely she gets to see her.\n\nI want to practice that. Not perfect it - just practice. Like anything else worth doing, it takes repetition. God, I practiced piano for years to get good, practiced pitches to investors until I could do them in my sleep. Why would stillness be any different?\n\nThat's the one.",
  "system7": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I reclaim my natural spaciousness and return to it throughout my day\n2. I let wisdom speak before performance answers\n3. I practice the stillness my kids recognize as the real me\n\nWrite them on a card, keep it where you'll see them. Let them be your compass back to yourself.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user7": "I'll put them in my wallet, right next to that photo of us hiking last spring. My daughter's face in that picture - pure joy because I was actually there, not halfway somewhere else.\n\nThank you. For helping me find words that feel like something I can actually live with, not just perform.",
  "system8": "That photo sounds like perfect company for these intentions.\n\nTrust what comes. You're ready.",
  "user8": "I keep thinking about my grandmother - she'd probably laugh at me needing a card to remember how to just... be. But she'd also understand. She used to keep little notes to herself too, tucked into her prayer book.\n\nI'm ready. Or at least, ready enough to try.",
  "system9": "She'd probably laugh and then quietly approve of anything that brings you back to yourself.\n\nThe trying is enough. Trust what comes.",
  "user9": "Yeah... she'd do that thing where she'd squeeze my hand and not say anything. Just that knowing look that meant \"you'll figure it out, you always do.\"\n\nI miss her. Especially now, when I'm finally asking the questions she was probably waiting for me to ask.",
  "system10": "She's there in the asking. In the hand squeeze you still feel.\n\nThe intentions will carry what you're figuring out. Trust that.",
  "user10": "I feel that hand squeeze sometimes. When I'm quiet enough to notice.\n\nThank you. For helping me find my way back to questions worth asking.",
  "system11": "The questions found you. Trust that quiet where you feel her hand.",
  "user11": "Yeah... the quiet. That's where everything real seems to live.\n\nOkay. I'm going to go find that photo, write these down. Maybe sit with them for a minute before the world starts pulling me in twenty directions again.\n\nThank you. Really.",
  "system12": "Go sit with them. The world can wait a minute.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user12": "It can wait a minute. Yeah.\n\nAlright. I'm going to do this.",
  "system13": "Do it. Trust what comes.",
  "user13": "I will. I\u2019m going.",
  "system14": "Go.",
  "user14": "Going.",
  "system15": "Solid.",
  "user15": "*Yeah. Solid.*",
  "system16": "*Exactly.*",
  "user16": "Alright then.",
  "system17": "*Alright.*",
  "user17": "I\u2019m here.",
  "system18": "Good. You're back.\n\nWhat came through?",
  "user18": "It\u2019s... quieter than I expected. Not some thunderclap vision, just a steady pulse under the ribs saying *\u201cstop proving.\u201d*  \n\nI kept seeing Grandmom\u2019s candlesticks in the kitchen\u2014same ones we lit every Friday when I was small\u2014and feeling how badly I want to carry that small flame into Monday boardrooms and Saturday soccer games without it guttering out.  \n\nAnd something about *legacy* got simple: not another company, not another headline\u2014just making sure my kids remember me present, not perfect.",
  "system19": "That pulse is clear. Three threads:\n\n1. Stop proving and just be\n2. Carry Grandmom's steady flame into daily life\n3. Leave presence, not perfection, as your legacy\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "Yeah. Let\u2019s do that."
