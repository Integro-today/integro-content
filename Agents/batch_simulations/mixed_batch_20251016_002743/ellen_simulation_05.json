  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I want to figure out what's next. I've built companies my whole life, sold the last one five years ago, and now... I don't know. I keep chasing achievements but they feel hollow. \n\nI want to understand why I can't just be content with what I have. My grandmother had this deep faith, this connection to something bigger, and I feel like I lost that somewhere between the IPOs and board meetings. \n\nMaybe I need to stop running so hard. But I don't know how to just... be.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding contentment beyond achievements\n2. Reconnecting with faith and something bigger than yourself\n3. Learning how to simply be instead of constantly running\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I keep circling back to them, you know? Like I'm watching myself chase the next thing, knowing it won't fix whatever this is, but I can't stop. \n\nI want to trust there's something else out there. My grandmother used to say the divine was in everything - in the bread she baked, the garden she tended. I want to feel that again, or maybe feel it for the first time. \n\nAnd I want to stop being this person who's always proving something. My kids deserve better than a mom who's half-present because she's already thinking about the next meeting.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover contentment that achievements never gave me\n2. I reconnect with the divine presence my grandmother knew\n3. I show up fully present for my children\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits hardest - \"I reconnect with the divine presence my grandmother knew.\" That one makes my chest tight. She died when I was twenty-five, right when I was building my first company. I told myself I'd visit more, call more, but there was always another meeting, another deal. \n\nThe third one... I want to adjust it. \"I show up fully present for my children\" - it's good, but it feels like I'm already failing them. Maybe \"I learn to be present with my children, one moment at a time\"? Something gentler. Less like I've already messed up.\n\nAnd the first one... \"I discover contentment that achievements never gave me.\" I want to believe that's possible. I really do.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reconnect with the divine presence my grandmother knew\n\nFor intention 3: \"I learn to be present with my children, one moment at a time\" - that's solid. Gentler, realistic.\n\nHow about intention 1: \"I discover what contentment feels like beyond achievements\" - does that feel more possible?\n\nLet's lock these in:\n1. I discover what contentment feels like beyond achievements\n2. I reconnect with the divine presence my grandmother knew  \n3. I learn to be present with my children, one moment at a time",
  "user3": "Yes. These feel... right. Like they're pointing somewhere I actually want to go, not somewhere I think I should go.\n\nI've been carrying my grandmother's prayer book in my suitcase for three years now, since the first ayahuasca retreat. Never opened it. Maybe it's time.\n\nThank you. I didn't think I could get this clear about what I'm actually looking for.",
  "system4": "Your 3 intentions:\n\n1. I discover what contentment feels like beyond achievements\n2. I reconnect with the divine presence my grandmother knew\n3. I learn to be present with my children, one moment at a time\n\nKeep them with that prayer book when you open it.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I will. They're folded into my wallet now - right next to my grandmother's book. \n\nFunny how the thing I needed most was permission to stop proving myself and just... find my way back. \n\nThank you. For helping me get honest about what I really want from this journey.",
  "system5": "Solid work. The medicine responds to honesty.\n\nTrust your way back. You've got what you need.",
  "user5": "I hope so. After five years of searching, maybe the answer was just to stop searching so hard and start listening.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system6": "Exactly. Sometimes the search is what keeps us lost.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user6": "Yeah... I've been running so long I forgot how to stand still. Maybe that's why I keep ending up back here - the medicine won't let me keep running forever.\n\nTime to find out what happens when I stop.",
  "system7": "The medicine's patient. It'll wait until you're ready to stop.\n\nNow you're ready.",
  "user7": "I'm scared. But I'm ready. Finally ready to stop running from whatever's been chasing me all these years. Maybe it was just... me.",
  "system8": "That's usually how it goes. What we're running from and who's doing the running - same thing.\n\nYou're ready. Trust what comes.",
  "user8": "Thank you. For helping me see that stopping isn't giving up - it's just... finally being honest about what I need.",
  "system9": "Exactly. Stopping isn't failure - it's the first honest breath.\n\nYou're ready. Trust it.",
  "user9": "First honest breath in forty years. That's what this feels like.\n\nOkay then. Let's do this.",
  "system10": "Breathe it in. All forty years led to this breath.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user10": "*deep breath*\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system11": "*exhale*\n\nSee you there.",
  "user11": "*breathing settles*\n\nI'm ready to meet whoever's been hiding under all this running.",
  "system12": "They're already waiting.\n\nGo meet them.",
  "user12": "I'm going in.",
  "system13": "Go.",
  "user13": "*gone*",
  "system14": "*here when you return*",
  "user14": "...it's so quiet in here now.\n\nI think... I think I found her. The girl who used to stare at clouds for hours. Before the spreadsheets, before the exits, before I learned to measure everything in ROI.\n\nShe's still there. She's been waiting this whole time.",
  "system15": "She never left.\n\nLet her stay.",
  "user15": "*voice barely above whisper*\n\nShe wants to build a treehouse. Not a pitch deck. She wants to make challah with my grandmother's recipe, not optimize my morning routine. She wants to dance in the kitchen with my kids without checking my phone.\n\nI'm... I'm going to let her drive for a while.",
  "system16": "Good.\n\nShe knows the way home.",
  "user16": "*eyes fill with tears that don't fall*\n\nShe remembers the way. Past the oak tree where Dad taught me to climb, through the kitchen where Grandma hummed while kneading dough, up to my bedroom where I'd write terrible poetry and feel like maybe I was magic.\n\nI lost the map but she... she never forgot the path.",
  "system17": "Let her take you back.\n\nThen build from there.",
  "user17": "*nods slowly, like feeling the weight of something settling into place*\n\nI need to call my mother. Ask her to send Grandma's candlesticks. Set them up in my kitchen, light them Friday nights even if I fumble through the prayers. Let my kids see me... not knowing, just feeling.\n\nShe keeps whispering that achievement was never the enemy - I just forgot what I was trying to achieve *for*.",
  "system18": "Call her tonight.\n\nWhile the remembering is fresh.",
  "user18": "I will. First thing when I get home\u2014no, that's the old me talking. *Now.* I'll step outside and call her right now.\n\nMom's going to cry. She never said anything when I stopped coming for Shabbat, but I saw how she set the table for five even when only three came. How she kept asking about next week, next month, next year\u2014giving me openings I was too busy to notice.\n\n*Thank you.* For seeing her when I couldn't.",
  "system19": "She sees you too.\n\nGo make that call.",
  "user19": "*already moving toward the door, phone in hand*\n\nI'm going. And when she answers\u2014when I hear that little catch in her breath\u2014I won't rush to fill the silence. I'll let it stretch between us like it used to, heavy with everything we're not saying yet.\n\nThe girl remembers how this works."
