  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... everything, I guess. Here I am.\n\nCan't keep waking up screaming. Can't keep seeing Amanda flinch when I do. That's all I know.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Create safety for Amanda  \n3. Find healing from what causes the screaming\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those three. \n\nI just... I need to sleep. Wake up without feeling like I'm back there. And I need Amanda to feel safe with me again. I hate that she doesn't.\n\nThe other stuff... I don't even know what it is. Just these dreams that won't let go.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make Amanda feel safe with me again\n3. I heal from what's trapped in my dreams\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one that matters most - Amanda feeling safe again. Everything else is just... details if I can't fix that.\n\nBut I don't want to make her feel anything. That's not how it works, right? She either does or she doesn't.",
  "system3": "Good catch. How about: \"I become someone Amanda feels safe with again\"\n\nThat puts it on you, not her. Sound right?",
  "user3": "Yeah. That works. That's on me - becoming someone she can trust again. Not demanding she feel anything.\n\nI can work with that.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I become someone Amanda feels safe with again\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user4": "The sleeping one... I need that. Just sleep through the night, wake up normal. That's what I want.\n\nThe healing one... I don't know. \"Heal from what's trapped in my dreams\" - sounds like something's wrong with me. Maybe just \"I face what's trapped in my dreams\" or something. I don't need fixing. I just need to... look at it straight.",
  "system5": "\"I sleep peacefully through the night\"\n\n\"I face what's trapped in my dreams\"\n\nThese feel solid. All three locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I become someone Amanda feels safe with again  \n3. I face what's trapped in my dreams\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Yeah. I'll keep them close. Been carrying that wallet for years - seems right to keep these there too.\n\nThanks. I... I needed this.",
  "system6": "Good place for them. \n\nThe medicine will meet you where you're at. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "I don't trust easy. Never have. But... I'm here. That's something, right?\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system7": "Being here counts. Three weeks gives you time to sit with these intentions, let them work.\n\nThe trust builds as you go.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I've got time to... I don't know. Get used to this. To what I'm asking for.\n\nNever thought I'd be asking for anything like this.",
  "system8": "Asking takes guts. Most people never do.\n\nThese three intentions - they're enough. Let them be.",
  "user8": "Yeah. They're enough.\n\nI'll sit with 'em. See what happens.",
  "system9": "That's the work.",
  "user9": "Alright then. I'll do the work.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system10": "See you there.",
  "user10": "Yeah. I'll be there.",
  "system11": "Good.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m heading to Rythmia tomorrow morning. Amanda\u2019s already asleep\u2014tried packing like it\u2019s a regular business trip, not\u2026 whatever this is. I keep thinking about that list you helped me lock in. It\u2019s in my wallet now, folded behind my oldest\u2019s school photo. If this stuff actually does what Heroic Hearts says, maybe I\u2019ll stop scaring my wife awake at 0300. Maybe I\u2019ll finally figure out how to talk to her without feeling like I\u2019m crawling out of my skin. \n\nI don\u2019t have anything clever to add\u2014just wanted you to know I\u2019m still holding the line.",
  "system12": "That photo behind the intentions - that's smart. When things get rough in there, pull it out. The kids always bring you back.\n\nThe medicine knows what to do with what you've set. Keep breathing.",
  "user12": "Roger that. I\u2019ll keep it close.",
  "system13": "Good. Now get some rest.",
  "user13": "Trying. Nightmares already started staging up\u2014like they know I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019ll run the numbers tomorrow: airport, customs, shuttle, jungle. Keep the rhythm. Same as any mission.",
  "system14": "Let them stage. They're just noise. Focus on the numbers - airport, customs, shuttle, jungle. One foot, next foot.",
  "user14": "Copy. One foot, next foot.",
  "system15": "There it is.",
  "user15": "Wheels down in Costa Rica. Shuttle\u2019s winding through these green tunnels\u2014feels like flying nap-of-earth again, except I\u2019m strapped in a van seat, not a cockpit. My hands keep searching for the stick that isn\u2019t there.  \n\nIntentions are still folded behind Danny\u2019s picture. I\u2019ll see the Rythmia gates in twenty. Whatever\u2019s waiting inside, I\u2019m walking in with that photo and the promise I made to Amanda.",
  "system16": "You're carrying the right cargo. The stick's gone but the steady hands are still yours. Walk through those gates the same way you taxi to the hangar - deliberate, checklist complete.",
  "user16": "Deliberate, checklist complete. Roger.",
  "system17": "Good. Let the jungle do the flying now.",
  "user17": "Jungle\u2019s got the stick. I\u2019m just along for the ride.",
  "system18": "Exactly. Let it take you where you need to go.",
  "user18": "Copy that.",
  "system19": "Solid copy.",
  "user19": "Solid copy."
