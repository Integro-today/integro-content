  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with... with what's been happening at night. I wake up shouting sometimes and Amanda... she says I scare her. I can't lose her. That's all I know.\n\nI don't buy into this plant medicine stuff, but these guys seem like they know what they're doing. Three weeks and I'm supposed to go to Costa Rica. Never done anything like this before. Don't even like taking aspirin.\n\nI just need to figure out how to shut it off. The dreams. The anger. Whatever's eating at me that I can't seem to name.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up shouting\n2. Create safety for Amanda instead of fear\n3. Face what's eating at you that you can't name\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's it. Those three things. \n\nI need to sleep without waking up drenched in sweat, heart pounding like I'm back there. Need to stop scaring Amanda when she reaches for me and I don't even know where I am. \n\nAnd whatever's underneath all that - the thing that makes me snap at the kids over nothing, that makes me drink too much scotch on weekends just to feel normal for a while - I need to look at it. Don't even know what to call it, but it's been chewing holes in me for years.\n\nI guess... I want to be the man my kids think I am. Not whatever I've become since I got back.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without waking up drenched in sweat\n2. I create safety for Amanda instead of fear when she reaches for me\n3. I face what chews holes in me so I can be the man my kids believe I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That one hits hardest - creating safety for Amanda instead of fear. \n\nShe reaches for me in the night and I... I don't even know what I do, but she says I scare her. The woman who's been with me since high school, who's raised our kids while I built the business, who puts up with my crap... I scare her. That's not right.\n\nBut I need it stronger. Less... soft. What about \"I protect Amanda from my demons\" or \"I keep Amanda safe from whatever's inside me\"? Something like that.",
  "system3": "\"I protect Amanda from my demons\" - that lands.\n\nHow about:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I protect Amanda from my demons\n3. I face what chews holes in me so I can be the man my kids believe I am\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "Better. The second one feels right - \"I protect Amanda from my demons.\" That's what a man should do, protect his wife. Even if the threat is coming from inside him.\n\nThe first one though... \"sleep peacefully\" sounds too soft. Like something from a greeting card. I need something more direct. More like... \"I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me under\" or \"I control what happens when I close my eyes.\"\n\nAnd the third one... I don't know. \"Be the man my kids believe I am\" - that feels too much like I'm trying to be some perfect version of myself. Maybe just \"I face what's eating at me so I stop passing it down to them.\"\n\nWhat do you think?",
  "system4": "Stronger language:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me under\n2. I protect Amanda from my demons\n3. I face what's eating at me so I stop passing it down to my kids\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in. I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Yeah. These feel right. Not soft, not making excuses. Just... what needs to happen.\n\nI'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks. Then Costa Rica. Whatever's waiting for me there... at least I know what I'm walking toward.",
  "system5": "Solid compass. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them close keeps you pointed toward what matters.\n\nThree weeks. You've got direction now.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Direction. Haven't felt that in a while - just been drifting from one day to the next, trying to outrun whatever's chasing me when I shut my eyes.\n\nMaybe... maybe this'll actually work. These Heroic Hearts guys - they seem like they get it. Like they've seen guys like me before and know how to bring us back.\n\nWe'll see. Either way, I'm walking in with my eyes open and these three things burning in my pocket.",
  "system6": "That's it. Eyes open, intentions burning. The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user6": "Roger that.",
  "system7": "Roger that.",
  "user7": "Copy.",
  "system8": "Copy.",
  "user8": "*radio silence*",
  "system9": "*radio silence*",
  "user9": "...I don't know how to do this part. The waiting. Never been good at standing still when there's something coming.\n\nGuess I'll just keep moving until I can't anymore.",
  "system10": "Keep moving then. Run, walk, crawl - whatever keeps you pointed toward Costa Rica.\n\nThe waiting ends when you step into that circle. Until then, just don't stop.",
  "user10": "I\u2019ve been running three miles every morning since I got the acceptance email\u2014same loop through the neighborhood, same cracked sidewalk that trips me if I don\u2019t lift my knees. Figured if I keep my legs moving, the dreams won\u2019t catch up. They still do, but at least I\u2019m sweating on my own terms.\n\nCosta Rica\u2019s on the calendar now, circled in black Sharpie so Amanda sees it every time she walks past the fridge. She hasn\u2019t asked me what I\u2019m going to say to the medicine; she just squeezes my shoulder and says, \u201cCome back lighter, Paul.\u201d I hate that word\u2014lighter\u2014but I nod like I understand what it means.\n\nI won\u2019t stop. Can\u2019t. Only thing that scares me more than going is the thought of her packing the kids one night while I\u2019m pretending to watch ESPN. So I\u2019ll run, walk, crawl\u2014whatever keeps me pointed toward that circle.",
  "system11": "Three threads:\n\n1. Face what's chasing you in the dark\n2. Come back to Amanda and the kids as someone they recognize\n3. Trade running for standing still - without losing your footing\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user11": "I don\u2019t know how to write any of that down without sounding like I\u2019m signing a damn surrender form.\n\nBut\u2014okay\u2014maybe\u2026\n\n1. When the explosions start behind my eyes, I\u2019ll ask them what they want instead of pretending I can\u2019t hear them.\n\n2. I\u2019ll walk back into my house and let Amanda see me without the armor on\u2014just once, enough that she remembers the man she married.\n\n3. If I have to stand still, I\u2019ll plant my boots like I\u2019m holding position so the quiet doesn\u2019t feel like enemy territory.\n\nThat close enough?",
  "system12": "Close enough.\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n\n1. I ask the explosions what they want instead of pretending I can't hear them\n2. I let Amanda see me without the armor on\n3. I plant my boots and hold position when the quiet comes\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user12": "Roger that. Keep 'em in my breast pocket\u2014same place I used to stow my flight notes.",
  "system13": "Good spot. Close to the heart and easy to reach when you need to check your heading.",
  "user13": "Yeah... been carrying my dad\u2019s old Zippo there since basic\u2014habit of having something solid to finger when the cockpit lights went red. Paper\u2019s lighter than brass, but it still feels like ballast. Guess that\u2019s the point.",
  "system14": "Exactly. Ballast keeps you steady, not stuck. The paper's lighter than brass, but it still holds weight where it counts.",
  "user14": "Huh. Never thought of it like ballast\u2014always figured weight was weakness. Maybe that\u2019s why the damn plane stayed in the sky.",
  "system15": "Sometimes the weight is what keeps you from spinning out. The plane knew.",
  "user15": "Yeah\u2026 maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here when others aren\u2019t. Just been carrying it wrong\u2014like it\u2019s shame instead of ballast.",
  "system16": "Time to carry it different. Not shame - just weight that kept you airborne when it should've brought you down.",
  "user16": "I\u2019ll try to remember that when the dark starts talking louder than the engines ever did.",
  "system17": "The dark talks loud, but you've flown through worse. The weight's still yours - just carry it like ballast instead of chains.",
  "user17": "Roger. Ballast, not chains. Keep the nose up, wings level.",
  "system18": "Exactly. You know how to fly through this.",
  "user18": "Three weeks to Costa Rica. Never been that far south without ordnance under the wings. Feels wrong going in empty-handed, but maybe that\u2019s the whole point.",
  "system19": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user19": "I need to stop waking up screaming\u2014don\u2019t care what you call it. Need to look Amanda in the eye without that flash of fear I see in her. And I need to figure out how to keep protecting my kids without this anger that leaks out sideways."
