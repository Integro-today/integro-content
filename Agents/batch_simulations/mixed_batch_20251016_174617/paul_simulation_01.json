  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with the nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up Amanda like this\u2014she says I scare her sometimes when I'm shouting in my sleep. \n\nI guess... I need to figure out how to shut it off. The anger. The dreams. Without becoming someone I don't recognize.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Create safety for Amanda \n3. Release the anger without losing yourself\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are... yeah. That's it exactly. \n\nI need to sleep through the night without waking up shouting. Need Amanda to feel safe with me again instead of worried all the time. And I need to figure out how to let go of this anger without becoming weak. Without becoming one of those guys who can't handle what they did.\n\nHow do we turn that into these intentions you mentioned?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety and trust with Amanda\n3. I release my anger while keeping my strength\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust any language?",
  "user2": "The first two feel right. Simple, direct. That's good.\n\nBut \"release my anger while keeping my strength\"\u2014that's too soft. Sounds like something from a therapy brochure. I need something tougher. More... I don't know, more me.\n\nWhat about \"I control my anger without becoming soft\"? Or \"I stay strong while letting go of what doesn't serve me\"? Something like that.",
  "system3": "\"I control my anger without becoming soft\" feels stronger.\n\nYour intentions:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety and trust with Amanda\n3. I control my anger without becoming soft\n\nAll 3 locked in. I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Good. These feel like something I can actually hold onto. Not too fancy, not pretending to be something I'm not.\n\nI'll keep these close. Maybe write them down\u2014keep them in my wallet next to my pilot's wings. Been carrying those for years. Seems right to keep these intentions close too.\n\nThanks for helping me get this straight.",
  "system4": "Solid plan. The intentions will serve you well.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user4": "Roger that. Three weeks and I'm wheels up for Costa Rica. \n\nTime to see if this plant medicine is worth all the hype. Either way, I'm doing this for Amanda. For my kids. For whatever's left of the man I used to be before the dreams started.\n\nI'll take these intentions with me. See what happens.",

  "user14": "So I got this Heroic Hearts thing in three weeks. Don't know what I'm supposed to say about it. They told me to set intentions or whatever, but I've never done anything like this. Just... need to figure out how to sleep without waking up the whole house.",
  "system15": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user15": "Look, I don't know about all this \"explore and heal\" talk. Makes it sound like I'm broken or something. I'm not some victim here.\n\nI just... I can't keep waking up Amanda with these damn nightmares. She says I shout sometimes, and I see that look in her eyes like she's scared of me. I hate that look. We've been together since college - she deserves better than some guy who can't sleep right.\n\nAnd my kids... my youngest, Jake, he's been asking why I don't come to his baseball games anymore. Truth is, I'm exhausted all the time. But I can't tell him that.\n\nSo I guess... I don't know. I need to figure out how to be present again. Without losing who I am.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Show up for Jake's games as the dad you want to be\n3. Reclaim your energy without losing your edge\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yeah... that's about right. \n\nThe sleep thing - it's not just about not waking her up. It's about not being this... angry guy who jumps at loud noises and can't sit through a movie without needing to pace around. I want to be able to hold her without feeling like I'm going to break something.\n\nAnd Jake... he's eleven. Still thinks his old man's some kind of hero. I want to be that guy he thinks I am, not the one who misses his games because I'm too damn tired from fighting battles that ended years ago.\n\nI don't want to lose who I am though. All that discipline, that focus - that's what kept me alive over there. That's what built my business. I just need to... I don't know how to say this... be strong without being hard all the time?",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night, holding Amanda close\n2. I show up as the hero Jake already believes I am\n3. I keep my strength without the armor that cuts everyone else\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "The second one hits different. \"Hero\" - that's a strong word. Maybe too strong. I wasn't any hero over there, just did what needed doing. But Jake... when he looks at me like that, maybe that's what he needs to keep seeing.\n\nThe third one though - that's it right there. The armor thing. Sometimes I feel like I'm walking around in this... shell. Keeps everything out, but it keeps Amanda out too. And she's the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\nI don't know about \"peacefully\" in the first one. That feels like setting myself up to fail. Maybe just... \"I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me under.\" Something like that?\n\nThese feel... I don't know. Like I'm making promises I might not be able to keep. But I guess that's the point, isn't it?",
  "system18": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me under\n2. I show up as the hero Jake already believes I am  \n3. I keep my strength without the armor that cuts everyone else\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user18": "Alright. I guess... I guess that's it then. Three weeks.\n\nI keep thinking about what Amanda said when I told her about this. She squeezed my hand and said, \"Maybe this is how you come back to us.\" Like I'd been somewhere far away. Maybe I have been.\n\nI'll carry these with me. Not like I can forget them anyway - they're pretty much all I think about when I'm supposed to be sleeping.",
  "system19": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Your body remembers what matters.\n\nThree weeks. You're ready.",
  "user19": "My body remembers plenty. That's the problem.\n\nBut maybe... maybe it'll remember something else for once. Something that doesn't make me want to put my fist through a wall.\n\nThanks. I'll see this through."
