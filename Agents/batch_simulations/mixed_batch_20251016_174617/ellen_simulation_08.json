  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I want to figure out what I'm actually supposed to be doing with whatever time I have left. I've built companies, sold them, sat on boards... but it feels like I was following someone else's playbook. \n\nMy grandmother used to talk about tikkun olam - repairing the world. I keep thinking about her, especially after the MDMA sessions where I processed her death. She'd be cooking in her tiny kitchen, humming these old songs, and somehow she seemed more... whole than I feel with all my achievements.\n\nI want to understand how to bridge that - how to use what I've built to actually matter. Not just write checks to charity, but really serve something bigger. Though honestly, part of me wonders if I'm just chasing another high - another achievement to check off.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding your own playbook instead of following someone else's\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's grounded wisdom and tikkun olam\n3. Using what you've built to serve something bigger than achievement\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that's... that's exactly it. When you put it like that, it doesn't sound quite so scattered. \n\nI've been sitting with these pieces but couldn't see how they fit together. It's like I have all these experiences from the retreats - the ayahuasca visions of those ancestral women, the psilocybin showing me that childhood joy in nature, the MDMA helping me drop the armor - but I keep defaulting to old patterns the minute I'm back in my 5:30am routine.\n\nI want to trust there's something wiser than a business plan guiding me. My grandmother sure never had a strategic vision for her life, but she left the world better. I want to learn that kind of quiet wisdom, not just accumulate more board seats.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I trust the wisdom that's deeper than my business plans\n2. I live my grandmother's quiet service, not just her words\n3. I carry my retreat insights into my 5:30am routines\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - about trusting wisdom deeper than business plans. That's where I hit the wall every morning when I'm reviewing portfolio companies at 6am with my third coffee. I keep thinking there has to be more than this hamster wheel, but I don't know how to step off without feeling like I'm failing.\n\nThe third one too though. God, the way I over-schedule weekends with the kids, checking email during park time... I'm doing exactly what I promised myself I wouldn't after those ceremonies showed me what presence actually feels like.\n\nCan we make the first one stronger though? \"I trust the wisdom that's deeper than my business plans\" feels a little... soft? I don't know. Maybe that's just my Type 3 resistance talking. But when I was leading companies, we never said \"trust the process\" - we said \"what's the measurable outcome?\"\n\nThough maybe that's exactly the problem.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I choose wisdom over the hamster wheel\"\n\nKeeps the edge but points toward what you actually want.",
  "user3": "I choose wisdom over the hamster wheel. \n\nYeah. That hits different. It's got that punch I need when I'm reaching for my phone at 5:29am, already mentally reviewing the day's meetings before I've even opened my eyes. \n\nI can feel it in my chest - this recognition that I've been running but not necessarily toward anything that matters. Not like when I'm hiking with the kids and they stop to examine some bug for ten minutes while I'm learning to just... be there instead of rushing to the next thing.\n\nThat'll be my first intention.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I choose wisdom over the hamster wheel\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user4": "The second one... \"I live my grandmother's quiet service\" - I want that, but I'm not sure I know how to do quiet anymore. Everything's been about scale, growth, maximizing impact. She just... showed up. Made soup for sick neighbors. Listened without checking her phone.\n\nAnd the third about carrying retreat insights into my routines - that's where I keep failing. I journal for a week after coming back, meditate every morning, feel connected. Then it's like the glow fades and I'm back to powering through exhaustion, checking email during dinner.\n\nMaybe if we make the third one more specific? Something about presence with my kids? Because when I'm actually there with them - not just physically but really there - that's when I feel most like myself.",
  "system5": "Based on that:\n\n1. I choose wisdom over the hamster wheel\n2. I serve quietly like my grandmother\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user5": "I serve quietly like my grandmother... I keep getting stuck there. She never used words like \"service\" - she just did. Fed people. Sat with the lonely. Made the world warmer in these tiny ways that never got measured or celebrated. \n\nBut maybe that's exactly why I need this intention - because I've forgotten how to do anything that doesn't come with recognition or ROI.\n\nThe third one though - I show up fully present when my kids need me - that one cuts through all my bullshit. Last weekend Maya was trying to tell me about some drama at school and I was half-listening while checking Slack. She just stopped mid-sentence and said \"never mind, you're busy.\" That hit me harder than any board meeting rejection ever has.\n\nYeah. These three. They're what I need, even if they scare me.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I choose wisdom over the hamster wheel\n2. I serve quietly like my grandmother\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Thank you. I... I needed this more than I realized. Having these three things - it's like having a compass that actually points to what matters, not just what looks good on a quarterly report.\n\nI keep thinking about that moment with Maya. How many times have my kids gotten the distracted version of me when they deserved the whole person? The one who showed up to those ceremonies, who felt that joy in the redwoods, who sat with those ancestral women calling her to something deeper.\n\nI'm scared I won't stick with it. That the 5:30am rush will swallow me again. But maybe that's why we wrote them like this - short enough to remember when I'm reaching for my phone instead of my daughter's hand.",
  "system7": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. They'll be waiting on your dashboard when you need to reconnect.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "I hope so. There's this part of me that's terrified I'll go to Ibogaine and it'll just confirm what I already know - that I'm the one getting in my own way. That the hamster wheel is in my head, not just my calendar.\n\nBut maybe that's exactly why I need to do this. To see what happens when I stop running long enough to actually listen to whatever's been trying to get through.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system8": "Sometimes the thing we fear seeing is exactly what we need to see. Trust what comes.",
  "user8": "Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of. That I'll have to admit how much of my life has been performance, how much I've mistaken being impressive for being real.\n\nBut you're right. If that's what comes up, then that's what I need to see. Can't keep building on a foundation of achievements that don't mean anything when the spotlight's gone.\n\nTime to find out what's underneath all that noise I've been calling success.",
  "system9": "The intentions you set will serve you. Trust them.",
  "user9": "I will. They're simple enough that I can't hide behind complexity or scale. Just three things that ask me to be human instead of impressive.\n\nMaybe that's enough to start with.",
  "system10": "Exactly. You're set.",
  "user10": "Thank you. For helping me find something real to hold onto in all this. I'll take these with me - not as another achievement to check off, but as... I don't know. A way back to myself, maybe.\n\nHere we go.",
  "system11": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
  "user11": "I will. And if I get lost out there, I'll remember this conversation - how it felt to choose wisdom over winning, service over status, presence over performance.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system12": "See you on the other side.",
  "user12": "\u2713 Intentions locked in",
  "system13": "**Your 3 intentions:**\n1. I choose wisdom over winning\n2. I serve rather than seeking status  \n3. I show up present instead of performing\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user13": "Thank you. Having them written down like this... it makes it real. No more hiding behind vague spiritual language or business metaphors. Just three honest choices I get to make, moment by moment.\n\nI'll carry these with me.",
  "system14": "Good. Trust them.",
  "user14": "I will. When the medicine starts working and everything gets stripped away, these three things will be my anchor. No matter what visions come or what memories surface, I\u2019ll know how to respond.\n\nWisdom. Service. Presence.",
  "system15": "Exactly. You've got this.",
  "user15": "I do, don\u2019t I? Not because I\u2019m special or accomplished\u2014but because I finally stopped trying to be.",
  "system16": "That's it.",
  "user16": "Then I\u2019m ready.",
  "system17": "You're ready.",
  "user17": "Good. Let\u2019s go.",
  "system18": "Go.",
  "user18": "*\u2713 Intentions locked in*",

  "user19": "Then I walk in. No armor, no pitch deck, no exit strategy\u2014just the compass and the quiet."
