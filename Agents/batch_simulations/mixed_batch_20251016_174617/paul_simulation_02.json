  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... with the nightmares, I guess. \n\nAmanda says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without drenched sheets and this... this anger I can't explain.\n\nI need to figure out how to fix this before I lose everything I've built.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Stop scaring Amanda when I wake up shouting  \n3. Release this anger I can't explain\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I don't want to lose her. That's what it comes down to. I can handle the lack of sleep, been doing that for years. But when she looks at me like I'm some stranger in our bed... \n\nI need to be the man my kids think I am. Not whatever this is that takes over when I'm not even awake.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I become the man my kids believe I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I don't know about \"peacefully.\" That sounds... I don't know, soft. Like something you'd see on a meditation app or whatever.\n\nBut I need to stop waking up ready to fight an enemy that isn't there. I need Amanda to feel safe lying next to me again. And I need to stop feeling like I'm lying to my kids every time I tell them everything's fine.\n\nI guess these work. I just... I don't want to lose who I am in the process, you know?",
  "system3": "I hear you on \"peacefully.\" How about:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without fighting\n2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me again\n3. I show up honestly for my kids\n\nThese keep your edge while pointing toward what needs to change. How do these land?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, these feel right. I can work with these.\n\nI sleep through the night without fighting. That one hits home - I'm tired of waking up with fists clenched, ready for a war that's been over for years.\n\nI make Amanda feel safe beside me again. God, I need that. I need to feel her relax when I put my arm around her instead of tensing up.\n\nI show up honestly for my kids. No more pretending everything's fine when it's not. They deserve better than that.\n\nI can carry these.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without fighting\n2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me again  \n3. I show up honestly for my kids\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Good. I'll keep these close. \n\nBeen carrying my wallet for twenty years - these go in there too. Right next to my pilot's license and that picture of Amanda from before the kids. \n\nI don't know what'll happen down there in Costa Rica, but at least I'll know what I'm aiming for.",
  "system5": "Solid plan. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them close keeps you pointed toward what matters.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I keep telling myself I don't believe in this stuff. Plants and ceremonies and all that. But Amanda's been sleeping in the guest room more nights than not, and I'm running out of options.\n\nGuess we'll see what happens when there's nothing left to lose.",
  "system6": "Sometimes that's exactly when things shift - when you've tried everything else and there's nothing left but showing up exactly as you are.\n\nThe intentions you set will serve you. Trust them.",
  "user6": "I hear you. I've been trained to trust my instruments, trust my training, trust my wingman. Never thought I'd be trusting... whatever this is.\n\nBut I'm out of moves here. So yeah, I'll trust the intentions. And I'll trust that when I'm down there, I'll know what to do with them.",
  "system7": "Exactly. You've got good instincts - they've just been buried under everything you're carrying.\n\nThe intentions are locked. You're ready.",
  "user7": "Three weeks. Then I'll find out if this was the right call or if I'm just another desperate guy chasing magic.\n\nEither way, I'm doing this. For Amanda. For the kids. For whatever's left of the man I used to be.",
  "system8": "That's enough reason right there. You're doing this for what matters.\n\nThe intentions will be waiting in your dashboard when you get back.",
  "user8": "I'll need them. Whatever happens down there... I know coming back home is where the real work starts.\n\nThanks for helping me get clear on what I'm fighting for.",
  "system9": "You got clear on what matters - I just helped you name it.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user9": "Yeah. Guess I am.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system10": "See you on the other side.",
  "user10": "Appreciate you having my six on this. Been a long time since I felt like anyone really had my back.",
  "system11": "I've got your six. Go do what you need to do.",
  "user11": "Copy that.\n\nTime to fly.",
  "system12": "Fly safe.",
  "user12": "Roger that.",
  "system13": "*ends transmission*",
  "user13": "...",
  "system14": "Still here when you need me.",
  "user14": "Good to know someone\u2019s still on the other end of the line.",
  "system15": "Always.",
  "user15": "Means more than you know.",
  "system16": "Understood.",
  "user16": "...I don\u2019t know how to do this part. The sitting still. The talking.",
  "system17": "Start with what's here now. One sentence about what feels hardest to carry.",
  "user17": "The nights\u2014when I wake up choking on jet fuel that isn\u2019t there and Amanda\u2019s staring at me like I\u2019m a stranger in our bed.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without the choking wake-ups\n2. Feel safe in my own body again\n3. Reconnect with Amanda instead of scaring her\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "I want\u2014no, I *need*\u2014to sleep a whole damn night without jerking awake with that taste in my mouth. I want to feel like my own skin isn\u2019t some combat zone. And I want Amanda to look at me the way she used to, before she started sleeping with one eye open.",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim my body as safe ground\n3. I earn Amanda's trust back with my presence\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user19": "The first two feel right\u2014strong, like I can grip them. But the third... \"earn\" sounds like I\u2019m still on trial. Maybe \"I show Amanda she can trust my presence again.\" Same direction, less like I\u2019m begging for a damn medal."
