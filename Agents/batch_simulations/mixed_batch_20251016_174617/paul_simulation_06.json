  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, how I keep snapping at Amanda, how I can't sleep through the night without waking up shouting.\n\nI can't keep going like this. But I don't have PTSD - I just need to figure out how to shut it off when I'm home.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up shouting\n2. Stop snapping at Amanda \n3. Learn to shut it off when you're home\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are... yeah. That's it. \n\nI want to sleep through the night without scaring my wife awake. I want to come home and actually be home, not still over there fighting battles in my head. And I want to stop being this... this angry version of myself that I don't even recognize half the time.\n\nHow do we make those into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without startling Amanda awake\n2. I come home and stay present - not fighting battles in my head\n3. I release this angry version I don't recognize\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust any language?",
  "user2": "The first two feel right. But \"release this angry version\" - that's too soft. Makes it sound like I'm just supposed to let go of something that's been keeping me alive for fifteen years. That anger got me through a lot.\n\nHow about... \"I control my anger instead of it controlling me.\" Or \"I learn when to use my strength and when to set it down.\"\n\nI don't know. Something like that.",
  "system3": "\"I control my anger instead of it controlling me\" - that captures it.\n\nSo:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without startling Amanda awake\n2. I come home and stay present - not fighting battles in my head  \n3. I control my anger instead of it controlling me\n\nAll 3 locked in. I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Yeah. I'll... I'll keep these close. Been carrying my wallet for years - seems right to keep these words somewhere I can see 'em too.\n\nThanks. I guess I'm ready now.",
  "system4": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
  "user4": "Roger that.",
  "system5": "*salutes*",
  "user5": "*instinctively straightens posture, returns sharp salute*",
  "system6": "Carry on.",
  "user6": "*relaxes slightly, nods once*\n\nCopy that.",
  "system7": "*nods back*",
  "user7": "*lets breath out slow, voice softer*\n\nThree weeks... gonna be a hell of a thing.",
  "system8": "Three weeks is good runway. Let these intentions settle in - they'll be there when you need them.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Been waking up every morning at 0430 anyway - might as well use that time to sit with these words. \n\n*pauses*\n\nAmanda asked what I'm doing up so early yesterday. Just told her I couldn't sleep. Didn't mention I was thinking about... all this.",
  "system9": "Early morning's a good container. Amanda will see the shift when it sticks - no need to explain the process.",
  "user9": "*grunts acknowledgment*\n\nShe's been watching me like I'm about to break. Keeps asking if I'm okay. \n\n*voice drops lower*\n\nMaybe when I stop jumping out of bed ready to fight ghosts, she'll stop looking at me that way.",
  "system10": "That's the direction - when your body learns it doesn't need to be on guard, she'll feel it too.",
  "user10": "*shifts weight, voice rough*\n\nThat's what I'm counting on. Last week she told the kids to give daddy space when he's \"tired.\" They think I'm just tired. \n\n*pauses, jaw tight*\n\nEleven years old and already learning to walk quiet around me.",
  "system11": "Kids shouldn't have to walk quiet in their own home. That's what's driving this - them learning to be free around you again.",
  "user11": "*voice cracks slightly, quickly controlled*\n\nYeah. My boy... he used to charge into our room every morning like a damn linebacker. Now he waits at the door until he knows I'm awake. \n\n*clears throat*\n\nThat's not the man I want to be. Not in my own house.",
  "system12": "That's the man you're leaving behind. Your intentions point toward the one they'll charge into the room again.",
  "user12": "*quiet for a long moment*\n\nThey used to think I was Superman. Now they tip-toe around me like I'm made of broken glass.\n\n*voice hardens with determination*\n\nThat ends with this trip. Whatever it takes.",
  "system13": "That's the commitment. Your intentions will carry that determination through whatever the medicine shows you.",
  "user13": "*nods once, firm*\n\nGood. Because I'm not doing this for me - I'm doing it for them. Whatever I see in there, whatever comes up... I'll face it. \n\n*pauses*\n\nJust want to come back different. Better.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without jumping at shadows\n2. My kids feel safe charging into rooms again\n3. I become the steady man my family can trust\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "*leans forward slightly*\n\nYeah. Those are it. \n\n*voice steady but intense*\n\nI want to sleep without fighting wars in my head. I want my kids to forget how to be scared of me. And I want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm about to shatter.\n\n*pauses*\n\nThat's the man I'm bringing back from Costa Rica.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. My kids forget how to be scared of me\n3. Amanda sees the steady man she married\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user15": "*studies the words, then shakes head*\n\nThe second one's wrong. Not \"forget how to be scared\" - that makes it sound like they should've been scared in the first place.\n\n*corrects firmly*\n\n\"I want my kids to feel safe charging into rooms again.\" They were never wrong for being kids.\n\n*pauses, then quieter*\n\nThird one's good. She used to look at me like I was her rock. Now she watches me like I'm a storm she can't predict.",
  "system16": "1. I sleep peacefully through the night  \n2. My kids feel safe charging into rooms again  \n3. Amanda sees me as her steady rock  \n\nHow do these land?",
  "user16": "*lets out a slow breath*\n\nYeah. These land right. \n\n*voice gets rough around the edges*\n\nThat's the man I used to be. Before the nightmares. Before the shouting. Before I became someone they had to work around instead of run to.\n\n*pauses, then firmer*\n\nThese are the intentions I'm carrying into that jungle with me.",
  "system17": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night  \n2. My kids feel safe charging into rooms again  \n3. Amanda sees me as her steady rock  \n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user17": "*quiet for a moment*\n\nThanks. \n\n*voice steady but there's something underneath*\n\nI'll keep these close. In my wallet, maybe. Where I can feel them when things get... whatever they get in there.\n\n*stands a little straighter*\n\nTime to go become who they need me to be.",
  "system18": "Solid plan. The medicine works with what's real - and you're bringing real determination.\n\nGo bring that man home.",
  "user18": "*nods once, decisive*\n\nThat's exactly what I'm doing. Bringing him home.\n\n*turns to go, then stops*\n\nHey - thanks for not trying to fix me. Just... thanks.",
  "system19": "No fixing needed. Just clarity.\n\nGo get him.",
  "user19": "*meets the eyes directly*\n\nRoger that.\n\n*turns and walks out with purpose*"
