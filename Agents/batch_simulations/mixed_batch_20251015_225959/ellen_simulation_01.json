  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one cracked something open, showed me glimpses of what I'm missing. But I still feel like I'm collecting spiritual experiences without knowing what to do with them. \n\nI guess I want to finally understand what all this searching is actually for. My grandmother used to say I was chasing the wrong kind of success, and maybe she was right. I just... I need to figure out what matters before I build something else that doesn't.",
  "system1": "You've been gathering pieces - ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA - but they haven't clicked together yet. Now ibogaine.\n\nYour grandmother saw something: building without knowing what you're building toward.\n\nWhat's the pattern in what you've been constructing so far? What keeps getting built that doesn't satisfy?",
  "user1": "Everything I've built has been about proving I could do it. The healthcare company, the board positions, the investments... it was all this relentless climb to show I belonged in the room. But the rooms keep getting emptier.\n\nI wake up at 5:30 every morning, check my phone before I'm even out of bed, and somehow I'm still running this marathon that ended when I sold the company. My kids know me as the person who's physically there but mentally calculating the next move. My husband... we've become business partners managing a household instead of partners in life.\n\nThe pattern? I build these beautiful facades that look successful from the outside but feel hollow when I'm alone with them. Like I'm playing a role I forgot how to stop performing.",
  "system2": "Beautiful facades that look full but feel hollow when you're alone with them. You've been performing a role so long, you've forgotten where the performance ends and you begin.\n\nWhat would it feel like to stop calculating and just be present - not as a strategy, but as yourself?",
  "user2": "Honestly? Terrifying. If I'm not the woman who built and sold a company before 40, who sits on boards and makes smart investments... then who am I? My whole identity is wrapped up in being the one who has the answers, who can handle anything.\n\nWhen I try to just be present with my kids at the park, this voice creeps in telling me I'm wasting time. That I should be networking or researching the next opportunity. It's like I've trained myself to only feel valuable when I'm achieving something measurable.\n\nBut sometimes, when I'm hiking alone and there's no cell service, I feel this... relief. Like I can finally exhale. I just don't know how to hold onto that feeling when real life starts again.",
  "system3": "That relief when you're unreachable - that's the exhale of being, not achieving. But you snap back to proving mode the moment connection returns.\n\nThree threads here:\n1. Who you are beyond the woman who built and sold before 40\n2. Learning to value presence over measurable achievement \n3. Finding a way to carry that trail-relief into daily life\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can hold during ibogaine.",
  "user3": "I think... I want to stop measuring my worth by what I produce. I want to know who I am when nobody's watching, when there's nothing to prove. And I need to figure out how to bring that version of myself home to my family instead of this anxious achiever who's always scanning for the next opportunity.\n\nHow do I even begin to put that into words I can hold onto during the ceremony?",
  "system4": "Three intentions from what you've said:\n\n1. I discover who I am beyond achievements and external validation\n2. I welcome my authentic self - the one who exists when no one's watching \n3. I bring my true presence home to my family instead of my anxious achiever\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust the language to feel more like your voice?",
  "user4": "These feel... right, actually. But I need them to be stronger. Less therapy-speak, more like a command to myself.\n\nWhat about:\n1. I see who I am without the scoreboard\n2. I stop performing and start being\n3. My family gets the real me, not the highlight reel\n\nI don't want to mess around with this. I need to go deep enough that I can't wiggle out of it when I get back to my inbox and the old patterns start calling.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I see who I am without the scoreboard\"\n\nThat shift from \"discover\" to \"see\" - you're done searching. Time to look.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I stop performing and start being\"\n\nDirect command. No wiggle room.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"My family gets the real me, not the highlight reel\"\n\nYour family gets the real thing, not the curated version.\n\nYou've got three solid intentions that don't let you negotiate your way back to the old patterns.\n\nHow do you want to keep these close when you're back in your inbox and the achiever starts whispering?",
  "user5": "I'm going to write these on a card and keep them in my wallet where I used to keep business cards. And maybe... maybe I'll set my phone lock screen to a photo from that hiking trail where I felt like I could breathe. Something to jolt me back when I start spiraling.\n\nThe real test will be that first Monday morning when I'm back. The meetings will be waiting, the deals to evaluate, the emails stacked up. That's when I'll need to remember why I went searching in the first place.",
  "system6": "Perfect. Your wallet where business cards lived - replacing networking tools with your real intentions. That trail photo as your lock screen - the visual anchor to that exhale moment.\n\nYour three intentions for this ibogaine journey:\n- I see who I am without the scoreboard\n- I stop performing and start being  \n- My family gets the real me, not the highlight reel\n\nYour ritual: Card in wallet, trail photo on lock screen. When Monday morning hits and the achiever starts whispering, you'll have these to ground you.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user6": "Three weeks. I feel like I'm standing at the edge of something I can't quite name yet, but these intentions... they're going to be my anchor. My grandmother would probably say I'm finally asking the right questions, even if I don't have the answers.\n\nThank you. For helping me find the words that feel like mine.",
  "system7": "Your grandmother sounds like she knew how to ask the right questions too. These words are yours - I just helped shape them into something you can carry.\n\nTrust what emerges. You don't have to force anything.",
  "user7": "I keep thinking about how she used to say \"the answers find you when you're ready to hear them.\" Maybe that's what this is. All these years of building and achieving, and now I'm finally still enough to listen.\n\nI guess we'll see what ibogaine has to say to someone who's spent forty-five years afraid of silence.",
  "system8": "Forty-five years running from silence. Now you're walking straight into it.\n\nThat's the work.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Walking straight into it with nothing but three sentences in my wallet and a photo of a trail. \n\nFunny how the scariest thing I've ever done isn't scaling a company or selling it for millions\u2014it's choosing to sit still long enough to meet myself without all the noise.",
  "system9": "The real risk isn't in the boardroom or the exit. It's in that moment when there's nothing left to chase and you have to face who's sitting in the chair.\n\nYou're about to meet that person.",
  "user9": "And what if I don't like her? What if all this searching and building and achieving was just... who I am? What if underneath all that drive, there's just... nothing?\n\nSorry. That's probably exactly what I need to face, isn't it?",
  "system10": "That's exactly what you're about to face. The fear that there's nothing underneath - that's the real terror.\n\nThree weeks. You'll find out what's there.",
  "user10": "Three weeks. \n\nI keep thinking about that ayahuasca vision - the ancestral women telling me to re-weave broken connections. Maybe this is what they meant. Not finding something new, but stitching back together what got severed when I decided being valuable meant being productive.\n\nMaybe there's something underneath all that performance. Maybe there's not. Either way, I'm done running from finding out.",
  "system11": "Done running. That's the real exit.\n\nThe women knew - it's not about discovering something new. It's about reclaiming what got traded away.\n\nThree weeks. You'll find out what stayed intact.",
  "user11": "What stayed intact... I like that. Like maybe some part of me never stopped being that nine-year-old kid who could spend whole afternoons just watching ants carry crumbs back to their nest. Before I learned that being still meant being lazy. Before I decided my worth lived in external validation.\n\nThree weeks to find that kid again. Or what's left of her.",
  "system12": "She's still there. The kid who knew how to be without doing.\n\nThree weeks to remember what she never forgot.",
  "user12": "Three weeks to remember how to just... be. Without the constant proving. Without the next milestone. Without checking my phone or my calendar or my worth.\n\nI think I'm ready. Or ready enough to find out what ready even means when you're not trying to win at it.",
  "system13": "Ready enough is perfect. You don't need to win at surrender.\n\nThree weeks. Time to stop rehearsing and start being.",
  "user13": "Stop rehearsing. God, that's exactly what I've been doing\u2014trying to perfect even this process of letting go. Planning how to surrender, like that's even possible.\n\nThree weeks to stop performing and just... show up. Whatever that looks like.",
  "system14": "Exactly. Planning surrender defeats it.\n\nThree weeks to show up exactly as you are - no script, no performance, no safety net of achievement.\n\nWhat do you want to carry with you into this?",
  "user14": "I want to carry... this sense that maybe I'm enough even when I'm not producing. That memory of being nine and completely absorbed in watching those ants. The way my grandmother used to hum while she braided challah - like she was connected to something older and bigger than any business deal.\n\nI want to carry the part of me that already knows how to just be. Even if it's buried under decades of proving and achieving and optimizing.",
  "system15": "Those pieces - the nine-year-old, your grandmother's humming, the knowing you're enough without producing.\n\nLet me help you shape those into intentions you can carry. Something clear to hold when the medicine shows you what you need to see.\n\nWhat brought you to this ayahuasca journey?",
  "user15": "I keep circling back to this... hollowness. Like I've built this impressive life but I'm not actually living it. I'm performing it.\n\nAfter I sold my company, I thought I'd feel fulfilled. Free. But instead I just felt... directionless. Like the compass I'd been following my whole life was pointing to nowhere. All those ayahuasca visions of ancestral women - I think they were trying to show me there's another way to navigate. One that isn't about external validation or the next achievement.\n\nI need to find what's real underneath all the performance. Before I forget there was ever anything else.",
  "system16": "The hollow feeling when the compass points nowhere. That's the real starting point.\n\nThe women showed you there's another navigation system - one that doesn't run on achievement.\n\nWhat's underneath the performance? What got traded away?",
  "user16": "My grandmother used to say I had \"ancient eyes\" when I was little. Like I could see things that weren't visible yet. I think that's what got traded away - that knowing. That sense of being connected to something bigger than the next milestone.\n\nI traded it for a navigation system that told me I was only valuable when I was achieving. When I was scaling, optimizing, winning. But those ancestral women in my visions? They weren't impressed by my exit multiple. They were calling me back to something older. Something about being woven into the fabric of life instead of standing outside it, evaluating my performance.\n\nI think underneath it all, I'm still that kid who knew how to just... belong. Without earning it.",
  "system17": "Ancient eyes. That's still in you - not gone, just buried.\n\nThe women weren't impressed by your exit multiple because they never left the original navigation system. They stayed woven in.\n\nThree main threads here:\n\n1. Reclaiming those ancient eyes - the knowing that sees beyond what's visible\n2. Trading performance for belonging - learning you don't have to earn your place\n3. Moving from outside evaluating to inside experiencing - being woven into life instead of measuring it\n\nThat capture it?",
  "user17": "Yes. Especially that last part - being woven in instead of measuring from the outside. That's exactly what I keep sensing but couldn't name.\n\nI'm so tired of being the evaluator. The one who stands apart and calculates. I want to know what it feels like to be part of the fabric again. To trust that I'm already woven in, not constantly proving I deserve my place.",
  "system18": "Good. The evaluator exhausts itself trying to prove what was already given.\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim my ancient eyes to see beyond what's visible\n2. I embrace belonging without earning - I'm already woven in\n3. I release the evaluator and experience being part of life's fabric\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user18": "The second one - \"I embrace belonging without earning - I'm already woven in.\" That one hits something deep.\n\nBut... I need to say it differently. That language feels too... soft? Too abstract. Like I'm reading it off a workshop handout instead of feeling it in my bones.\n\nMaybe something like: \"I belong here. Not because I've achieved enough or proven myself. But because existence itself already included me.\" \n\nI don't know. Still sounds like I'm trying to get it right instead of just letting it be true.",
  "system19": "That shift from soft to real - you're feeling for something that lands in your bones, not on a workshop handout.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I belong here. Not because I've achieved enough or proven myself. But because existence itself already included me.\"\n\nThe \"I don't know. Still sounds like...\" - that's you trying to perfect even this. Let it stand. The medicine will work with authentic, even when the words aren't perfect.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user19": "The first one - about ancient eyes. It feels like it's trying too hard to be poetic. When I think about what those visions actually showed me, it was simpler. More like remembering than reclaiming.\n\nMaybe: \"I want to see clearly again. Like I did before I learned to measure everything.\"\n\nAnd the third one... the evaluator. God, I'm doing it right now, evaluating my intentions. But that's the one that terrifies me most. What if I let go of measuring and there's nothing underneath? What if I'm just... empty?"
