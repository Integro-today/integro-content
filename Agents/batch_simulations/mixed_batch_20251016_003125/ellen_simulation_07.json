  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I need to figure out what I'm actually doing with my life now. I built this company, sold it, made more money than I'll ever need, and now... what? I keep chasing the next thing but it's not filling this hole I feel.\n\nI want to understand why all the success feels hollow. Like I've been climbing this ladder that's leaning against the wrong wall. And I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had nothing by today's standards but seemed so grounded in her faith. I feel like I've lost something important that she understood.\n\nMy family deserves better than this version of me who's always half-present, always planning the next move. My kids are 9 and 12 - they need me now, not this distracted shadow I keep becoming.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond external success\n2. Being fully present with your family instead of mentally elsewhere  \n3. Reconnecting with grounded wisdom and faith like your grandmother had\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the three things that keep circling in my head. I just don't know how to get there from here. I've tried meditation, journaling, all the things people say to do, but I can't seem to make it stick. It's like I know what matters but I can't seem to live it.\n\nMy grandmother would light candles every Friday and somehow that simple ritual made our whole house feel different. I want that - not the candles necessarily, but that sense of... I don't know, being rooted in something bigger than quarterly earnings and board meetings.\n\nI keep thinking this ibogaine journey might show me something, but I'm scared it'll just be another experience I can't integrate. Another thing I try and then forget when real life takes over.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what fulfillment looks like beyond external achievements\n2. I show up fully present when my family needs me\n3. I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith I've been searching for\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest - \"I discover what fulfillment looks like beyond external achievements.\" That's the core of it. I keep checking boxes, hitting milestones, but it's like I'm following someone else's map. I need to find my own compass.\n\nThe second one feels too... I don't know, clinical? \"Show up fully present\" sounds like something from a corporate workshop. But yeah, I want to be there for them. Not just physically in the room while my mind's drafting emails.\n\nAnd the third one - \"reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith\" - I like that word, reclaim. Like it's something I lost, not something I need to invent. My grandmother's been gone ten years now, but sometimes I swear I can still smell her cooking when I'm really quiet.\n\nCan we make the second one more... human? Less like a performance review and more like what it actually feels like when you're really with your kids?",
  "system3": "How about:\n\n1. I discover what fulfillment looks like beyond external achievements\n2. I sink into being truly with my kids when they need me\n3. I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith I've been searching for\n\nThat second one feel more human?",
  "user3": "Yeah... \"sink into being truly with my kids\" - that's it. That's what it feels like when I'm at the park with them and everything else just falls away. No phone, no emails, just watching my daughter try to master the monkey bars for the tenth time or hearing my son explain some video game thing I don't understand but I'm trying to.\n\nI want more of those moments. Where I'm not splitting myself between where I am and where I think I should be. Where I'm just... there. Fully there.\n\nThese three feel right. Like they're pointing me somewhere I actually want to go, not just where I think I should go.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I discover what fulfillment looks like beyond external achievements\n2. I sink into being truly with my kids when they need me\n3. I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith I've been searching for\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down - maybe keep them in my wallet next to that photo of the kids from last summer. Been carrying that around for months.\n\nI don't know what'll happen with the ibogaine, but having these... it feels like I'm not just going in blind. Like maybe I can actually hold onto whatever shows up this time.",
  "system5": "That photo sounds like a good anchor. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're already doing their job by pointing you toward what matters.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah... that photo. My daughter's got this gap-toothed smile and my son's hair was sticking up every which way. We were all sweaty from hiking and so damn happy. \n\nMaybe that's what I'm really looking for - more moments like that, where I'm not performing or achieving, just... being. Being with them. Being with myself.\n\nI guess we'll see what the medicine shows me. Thanks for helping me get clear on this.",
  "system6": "Exactly. Those moments show you everything you need to know.\n\nSolid compass. You're ready.",
  "user6": "Ready as I'll ever be. Thanks for walking through this with me.",
  "system7": "You're welcome. Trust the work you've done here.",
  "user7": "I will. Feels different this time - like I'm actually bringing something with me instead of just hoping to find it there.",
  "system8": "That's it. The intentions travel with you either way - written or not.",
  "user8": "*That's* what I needed to hear. They've been traveling with me this whole time, haven't they? Even when I couldn't name them.",
  "system9": "Exactly. You just gave them words.",
  "user9": "Yeah... I guess that's what this work is about. Finding the words for what you already know deep down.",
  "system10": "Precisely.",
  "user10": "Makes me wonder what else I already know but haven't found words for yet.",
  "system11": "The medicine will show you.",
  "user11": "Then I guess it's time to stop talking and start listening.",
  "system12": "That's the work.",
  "user12": "I\u2019m ready to do it.",
  "system13": "Good hunting.",
  "user13": "See you on the other side.",
  "system14": "Bring back what matters.",
  "user14": "I will. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m sure of right now.",
  "system15": "That's enough.",
  "user15": "Yeah. It is.",
  "system16": "Hold that.",
  "user16": "I\u2019m trying. Some days it slips, but I keep coming back to it.",
  "system17": "Coming back is the practice.",
  "user17": "Then I guess I\u2019m practicing. Even when it feels like I\u2019m failing at everything else.",
  "system18": "Practice counts when it feels like failure.",
  "user18": "Good. Because most mornings I sit for five minutes, last two on my phone, and call it \u201cmindfulness.\u201d",
  "system19": "Five minutes counts.",
  "user19": "Five minutes is what I can give without the whole day toppling."
