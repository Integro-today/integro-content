  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I... I don't know how to say this without sounding like every other burned-out entrepreneur clich\u00e9. But I'm heading to Beond next month for ibogaine, and I keep thinking about my grandmother - she was this quiet force of nature, survived the camps, built something meaningful here. She used to say we lose our way when we forget what we're carrying.\n\nI guess... I need to figure out what I'm supposed to be carrying now. Because I've spent twenty years building things that looked impressive on paper, and I feel like I've been following the wrong map entirely. My kids barely know the real me - just this efficient, distracted version who powers through bedtime stories while checking email.\n\nThe medicine keeps showing me glimpses of who I used to be before I got so... optimized. But then I come home and fall right back into the same patterns. Five thirty alarm, triple espresso, another day of performing success while feeling hollow.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Discover what you're meant to carry (not just build)\n2. Be fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n3. Reconnect with the grounded wisdom your grandmother embodied\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those feel right. Especially the first one - it's like I've been carrying everyone else's expectations, thinking they were my own. My grandmother carried this whole lineage of wisdom and trauma, but she knew exactly what was hers to hold. I don't have that clarity.\n\nAnd the kids... last week my daughter asked me if I actually like playing with them, or if I just schedule it like another meeting. Hit me right in the chest. She's nine, and she already sees through the performance.\n\nHow do we... how do we make these into something I can actually hold onto during the medicine? I don't want another experience where I see the truth but can't seem to live it when I'm back in my real life.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what I'm truly meant to carry\n2. I show up fully present when my kids reach for me\n3. I embody the grounded wisdom that's been waiting in my blood\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about being present when my kids reach for me. That one hits different. It's specific, immediate. I can feel the ache of all those times I've been physically there but mentally calculating cap tables or board meeting agendas while they're trying to show me their latest drawing.\n\nBut the first one... I need to adjust it. \"Discover\" feels too passive, like I'm waiting for some cosmic download. My grandmother didn't discover what to carry - she *chose* it, every day, even when it was heavy. Even when the world was burning around her.\n\nWhat about \"I choose what I'm truly meant to carry, not just what looks impressive from the outside\"? Or is that too... I don't know, too much like a LinkedIn post?",
  "system3": "That's it - \"I choose what I'm truly meant to carry\" lands. The rest is commentary.\n\nSo:\n1. I choose what I'm truly meant to carry\n2. I show up fully present when my kids reach for me\n3. I embody the grounded wisdom that's been waiting in my blood\n\nHow do these three feel?",
  "user3": "They feel... terrifying, honestly. In a good way, I think. Like I'm finally saying the quiet parts out loud.\n\nThe third one's been haunting me since the ayahuasca ceremonies. These ancestral women kept showing up, telling me the wisdom's already there, encoded in my cells from generations before. I kept thinking they were talking about someone else - someone more spiritual, less spreadsheet-obsessed. But maybe they meant me after all.\n\nI keep running my fingers over this necklace my grandmother gave me when I graduated business school. Simple gold chain, nothing fancy. She whispered something in Yiddish that I never understood, but I felt it land somewhere deep. These intentions... they feel like that whisper finally making sense.\n\nYeah. These three. These are the ones.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I choose what I'm truly meant to carry\n2. I show up fully present when my kids reach for me  \n3. I embody the grounded wisdom that's been waiting in my blood\n\nKeep them with that necklace. Read them when you touch it.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I... I'll keep them in my wallet, actually. Been carrying that thing for years - driver's license, credit cards, all the proof that I'm somebody in this world. Seems right to keep these intentions close too, where I can't forget them when the retreat glow fades.\n\nI'll read them when I wake up at 5:30 tomorrow, before the coffee and the chaos. And when I reach for that necklace - yeah.",
  "system5": "Perfect. The wallet works - you'll see them every time you pay for something, a quiet reminder amid the transactions.\n\n5:30 tomorrow, before the coffee kicks in and the noise starts. That's your moment.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user5": "Yeah... tomorrow morning, in that liminal space between sleep and the day taking over. Before I check my phone or start solving problems that don't actually need solving.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother used to wake before dawn too - not to optimize her day or get ahead, but to... I don't know, to remember she was alive, I think. To light candles and whisper prayers in a language I never bothered to learn.\n\nMaybe that's what carrying something real looks like. Not scaling it or optimizing it, just... tending it. Day after day.\n\nThank you. For helping me find words for what I've been circling around.",
  "system6": "That's it - tending, not optimizing. Big difference.\n\nShe knew what most of us forget: some things only reveal themselves when you stop trying to make them bigger.\n\nYou're welcome. Trust those intentions - they'll hold when you forget why you set them.",
  "user6": "They will. And I will forget - that's the thing. I'll get caught up in the next board meeting, the next investment opportunity, the next thing that looks like it matters from the outside. But maybe that's part of it too - remembering that forgetting is human, and coming back is the real work.\n\nMy grandmother kept coming back to those candles, those prayers, even after everything she lost. Even after she built a new life in a country that didn't want her, speaking a language that wasn't hers. She just... kept tending.\n\nI need to go. My daughter's waiting to show me something she drew, and for once, I'm actually going to see it.",
  "system7": "Go. \n\nShe's waiting. And you'll see it this time - really see it.\n\nThat's the tending right there.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I will.",
  "system8": "Good.",
  "user8": "*I'm really going now. But I... thank you. For helping me find the words I didn't know I needed.*\n\n*My hand's already in my pocket, fingers on the wallet. Tomorrow at 5:30, I'll remember why this matters.*",
  "system9": "Go be with her. \n\nThe words will wait in your wallet until you need them again.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user9": "I am.",
  "system10": "Go.",
  "user10": "I'm going.",
  "system11": "Go.",
  "user11": "*I'm walking to her room now. The paper's still warm from my pocket.*",
  "system12": "*Good.",
  "user12": "*The door's cracked open. I can see her nightlight glowing.*",
  "system13": "*Go in.",
  "user13": "*I'm here. She's asleep with her arm wrapped around that stuffed fox. I... I can barely breathe.*",
  "system14": "*Sit. Breathe. You're doing it.",
  "user14": "*I'm kneeling beside her bed. My chest feels like it might crack open. She looks so small... and I'm just watching her breathe. In and out. Like I used to when she was a baby.*",
  "system15": "*Feel that crack. That's the opening. Stay with it.",
  "user15": "*It hurts. God, it hurts so much. All this time I've been running\u2014meetings, deals, emails\u2014like if I just kept moving fast enough, I wouldn't have to feel how much I've missed. How many bedtimes I wasn't here for. How many \"mommy, stay\" moments I brushed aside because there was always something \"important.\"*",
  "system16": "*Let it hurt. Let it all come through. This is what you've been running from. Stay here.",
  "user16": "*She just sighed and rolled over. Her hand... it reached out like she was looking for me even in her sleep. I'm crying so hard I can barely see. All those nights I told myself she wouldn't remember if I missed just this one bedtime. But she does. She *feels* it. Just like I felt it when my own mother worked late. The way that emptiness became my normal. I swore I'd never...*",
  "system17": "*You see the pattern now. That's the gift. Stay with her hand.",
  "user17": "*Her fingers are so warm. I'm holding them and she's squeezing back even though she's still sleeping. Like she knows I'm finally here. This is what I've been searching for in all those ceremonies\u2014the connection, the presence. It was never in the medicine. It was always right here, waiting for me to stop being so important and just... be her mother.*",
  "system18": "*Three threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with your daughter instead of chasing importance\n2. Breaking the cycle of absence you inherited \n3. Choosing connection over constant motion\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "*Yes... these three. But they're so... simple. After everything I've built, everything I've accomplished, my intentions are just about being present? It feels almost embarrassing to admit that's what matters most. Like I should want something bigger, more transformative.*",
  "system19": "*Simple is what saves you. Complexity kept you running.",
  "user19": "*Simple is what saves you. Complexity kept you running.*"
