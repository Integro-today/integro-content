  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I guess I'm supposed to have intentions for this. The thing is, I've done this before - ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA - and I always come back with these beautiful insights about connection and meaning, but then... \n\nI don't know. Three months later I'm back to waking up at 5:30, checking my portfolio, sitting on boards I don't care about. My kids are growing up and I'm physically there but mentally somewhere else. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this way of making every moment feel sacred. And I'm here with everything I thought I wanted, feeling like I'm wasting it. Like there has to be more than this constant striving.\n\nI want this time to be different. I want whatever I learn to actually stick.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n2. Living what you learn instead of collecting insights\n3. Reconnecting with that grounded wisdom your grandmother had\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly right. \n\nI keep picturing my daughter's face when I'm reading emails at the park - this look of resignation, like she's already given up on me being really *there*. And my grandmother... she'd light candles on Friday nights and suddenly our whole kitchen felt like a different world. She made holiness seem simple, ordinary even. Just dinner, family, gratitude.\n\nBut I don't know how to get from here to there. I've tried journaling after retreats, meditation apps, even hired a spiritual coach last year. Nothing seems to bridge that gap between who I am in ceremony - this open, connected person - and who I am on Tuesday morning when three boards need reports and my son's late for school.\n\nI guess I want to understand what I'm missing. Why can't I hold onto that sense that everything is already enough?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n2. I live what the medicine shows me, not just witness it\n3. I reclaim the grounded wisdom that's already mine\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The third one - \"I reclaim the grounded wisdom that's already mine\" - that hits something deep. Because it's not about becoming someone new, is it? It's about remembering who I was before I got so... busy proving myself.\n\nBut I want to adjust it. \"I reclaim the grounded wisdom that's already mine, the way my grandmother carried her faith like a quiet flame.\"\n\nAnd the first one about my kids... can we make it stronger? Less gentle? Because \"show up fully present\" feels too soft for what I need. I need something that grabs me by the throat when I'm reaching for my phone at dinner.\n\nMaybe: \"I choose my children over my devices, my worries, my endless to-do lists. They get the best of me, not what's left over.\"\n\nThe second one... I don't know. \"Live what the medicine shows me\" - it sounds right but I need to feel it in my bones.",
  "system3": "\"I choose my children over my devices, my worries, my endless to-do lists. They get the best of me, not what's left over.\"\n\n\"I live what the medicine shows me - not as a tourist collecting insights, but as someone who practices daily what he learns.\"\n\n\"I reclaim the grounded wisdom that's already mine, the way my grandmother carried her faith like a quiet flame.\"\n\nAll 3 locked in. \n\nKeep them where you'll see them each morning - phone lock screen, bathroom mirror, wherever you look first.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Thank you. I'll write them down - maybe keep them in my wallet where I used to keep business cards. \n\nFunny... my grandmother used to say \"write it on your heart, not just paper.\" I think I'm finally understanding what that means.",
  "system4": "Your grandmother knew - some things need to go deeper than paper.\n\nThe wallet works. Let these intentions settle into your bones, not just your mind.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user4": "Yeah... she always knew. I just got too busy to listen.\n\nI'll carry them. All of them. And maybe this time, I'll actually come home different.",
  "system5": "You already are different - you just remembered how to listen.\n\nCarry them well.",
  "user5": "I have been... thank you. For helping me hear myself again.",
  "system6": "You did the hearing. I just held up the mirror.\n\nSafe travels.",

  "user8": "I will. They're at the park waiting for me - probably wondering why I'm still on my phone. Time to go be the mom they deserve.",
