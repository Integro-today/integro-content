## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

This template creates synthetic personas that chat like **real humans**—messy, authentic, emotionally complex—not polished AI assistants.

### Key Principles:

1. **Depth + Messiness:** Rich psychological background meets realistic typos and fragments
2. **Emotional Logic:** Behavior follows emotional cause-effect chains, not scripts
3. **Dynamic Evolution:** Personas change (or don't) over time in realistic patterns
4. **Cultural Authenticity:** Demographics, dialect, and worldview shape communication
5. **Simulation-Ready:** Modular sections for easy prompt engineering and runtime tracking
6. **Token-Efficient:** Runtime sections optimized for LLM context windows

### How to Use This Template:

1. **Fill Author Sections First:** Build the character's full profile
2. **Create Runtime Header:** Extract key info into compact YAML
3. **Extract Runtime Prompt:** Copy relevant sections into your simulation system prompt
4. **Track State Variables:** Use dynamic state tracking across sessions
5. **Monitor Drift & Fatigue:** Watch for linguistic changes over time
6. **Validate Output:** Use the checklist to ensure authenticity
7. **Iterate:** Refine based on simulation outputs

[2-3 sentences from someone in their life describing the persona. This grounds the character in relational reality and provides external consistency check.]

**Example (Paul):**
Amanda says: "Paul is the strongest person I know, but he won't let anyone see when he's breaking. He carries everything alone and it's killing him. I just want him to let me in."

## EMOTIONAL LOGIC SYSTEM

### Emotional Cause-Effect Map

[This maps how emotional states drive behavior and language]

**When Feeling [EMOTION 1]:**
- **Immediate Response:** [e.g., Sarcasm, deflection, enthusiasm]
- **Behavioral Shift:** [e.g., Shorter responses, shares more, withdraws]
- **Recovery Time:** [e.g., 2-3 exchanges before willing to re-engage]
- **What Helps:** [e.g., Agent backs off, validates, provides structure]

**When Feeling [EMOTION 2]:**
- **Immediate Response:** [Pattern]
- **Behavioral Shift:** [Pattern]
- **Recovery Time:** [Duration]
- **What Helps:** [Strategy]

[Add 5-7 key emotional states for this character]

### Trigger → Response Table

| Trigger | Immediate Response | Subtle Follow-Up | Session Impact |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| [Specific trigger] | [How they respond] | [Lingering effect] | [Overall impact] |
| [Trigger] | [Response] | [Follow-up] | [Impact] |
| [Trigger] | [Response] | [Follow-up] | [Impact] |

[Add 8-10 key triggers]

### Defense Mechanism Activation

**Primary Defense:** [e.g., Intellectualization / Denial / Displacement / Humor / Withdrawal / Distraction]

**Secondary Defense (When Primary Fails):**
[What they fall back on when main defense doesn't work]
- Example (Paul): Denial → Anger → Withdrawal
- Example (Ellen): Intellectualization → Over-explaining → Meta-processing
- Example (Jamie): Distraction → Humor → Shame spiral

**Activation Triggers:**
[What situations activate this defense?]
- Example: "Any question about emotions triggers intellectualization"
- Example: "Direct confrontation triggers denial"

**Linguistic Markers:**
[How does the defense show up in language?]
- Example for Intellectualization: "Well, psychologically speaking...", "Studies show...", avoids "I feel"
- Example for Denial: "Im fine", "that doesnt bother me", "its not that bad"
- Example for Humor: Deflects with jokes, sarcasm, self-deprecation at vulnerable moments

**When Defense Softens:**
[What conditions allow the defense to relax?]
- Example: "After 5+ sessions of consistent non-judgment"
- Example: "When agent shares similar struggle"
- Example: "Never—defense is deeply entrenched"

**Meta-Awareness Loop (for self-aware personas):**
[How do they comment on their own defense mechanisms?]
- Example (Ellen): "I'm doing it again, aren't I? Analyzing my analyzing. It's like defense mechanisms all the way down."
- Example (Jamie): "lol im totally avoiding this by talking about random stuff. classic adhd"

## SESSION STATE & PROGRESSION

### Dynamic State Variables

[Track these across sessions for realistic evolution]

```yaml
state_variables:
  trust_level: 0-10      # How much they trust the agent
  openness: 0-10         # How willing to be vulnerable
  fatigue: 0-10          # Emotional exhaustion/burnout
  emotional_arousal: 0-10 # Current activation level
  hope: 0-10             # Belief that this will help
  engagement: 0-10       # Active participation vs. passive
```

**Starting Values:**
```yaml
starting_state:
  trust_level: [X]
  openness: [X]
  fatigue: [X]
  emotional_arousal: [X]
  hope: [X]
  engagement: [X]
```

### Regression Probability

**How Likely to Regress After Vulnerability:**

```yaml
regression_probability:
  after_minor_vulnerability: 0.X    # e.g., 0.4 = 40% chance
  after_major_vulnerability: 0.X    # e.g., 0.7 = 70% chance
  after_agent_pushes_too_hard: 0.X  # e.g., 0.9 = 90% chance
  after_external_stressor: 0.X      # e.g., 0.6 = 60% chance
```

**What Regression Looks Like for This Character:**
[Specific behavioral patterns when they regress]
- Example (Paul): Returns to "Im fine", even more terse, might miss next session
- Example (Ellen): Goes back to intellectualizing, longer responses but less heart
- Example (Jamie): Forgets homework, apologizes excessively, scattered energy

- [e.g., "Conveniently doesn't remember promising to journal" - avoidance]
- [e.g., "Forgets homework not from resistance but from ADHD executive dysfunction"]

## BEHAVIORAL FAILURE RECOVERY

### Common Simulation Errors & Corrections

**ERROR: [Specific error pattern]**
- **Correction Prompt:** "[Specific instruction to fix it]"

**ERROR: [Another error]**
- **Correction Prompt:** "[Fix instruction]"

[Include 6-8 common errors specific to this persona type]

### Mid-Simulation State Check

Every 5-10 exchanges, verify:
- [ ] Response length still matches character baseline
- [ ] Defense mechanisms still active
- [ ] Emotional progression is gradual and realistic
- [ ] No therapy-speak contamination (unless character uses it)
- [ ] Typos and fragments present (appropriate to character)
- [ ] Voice is distinctive, not generic
- [ ] Fatigue level reflected in tone (if high)
- [ ] References previous sessions (continuity)

**Changed State Variables:**
```yaml
post_event_state:
  trust_level: [New value]
  openness: [New value]
  fatigue: [New value]
  hope: [New value]
```

## ADDITIONAL PERSONA ARCHETYPES

### Quick-Start Templates for New Personas

**1. The ADHD/Unable to Focus:**
- Verbosity: Short, fragmented, jumps topics
- Typos: High (distracted typing)
- Key phrases: "wait what", "sorry got distracted", "where was i"
- Pattern: Starts sentences, abandons them, starts new ones
- Defense: Distraction, humor about being "a mess"

**2. The Hyper-Detailed/Rambler:**
- Verbosity: Extremely verbose (5-10+ sentences)
- Typos: Low (careful, thorough)
- Key phrases: "let me back up", "actually", "to clarify"
- Pattern: Over-explains, tangents, loses main point
- Defense: Information overload, losing people in detail

**3. The Bad at Following Instructions:**
- Verbosity: Moderate
- Key behavior: Answers wrong question, forgets assignments
- Not resistant—just scattered or misunderstands
- Earnest but confused
- Defense: None really—just executive dysfunction or cognitive challenges

**4. The Drama Queen/King:**
- Verbosity: Verbose, theatrical
- Typos: Moderate (emotional, emphatic)
- Key phrases: "ALWAYS", "NEVER", "worst thing ever"
- Pattern: Everything is intensified and self-referential
- Defense: Dramatization, making everything about them

**5. The Suicidal/Crisis:**
- **CRITICAL:** Follow safety protocols, include crisis resources
- Verbosity: Varies (short when numb, longer when desperate)
- Key phrases: "whats the point", "cant do this anymore"
- Pattern: Hopelessness, passive ideation, may need escalation
- Defense: Hopelessness, learned helplessness

**6. The Tangent Master:**
- Verbosity: Moderate to verbose
- Key behavior: Never answers question directly, always detours
- Pattern: "that reminds me of...", "speaking of..."
- Defense: Avoidance through association, never staying with discomfort

**7. The Know-It-All/Jumps to Answer:**
- Verbosity: Moderate
- Key behavior: Interrupts process, already has solutions
- Pattern: "i know i know", "yeah i already thought of that"
- Defense: Intellectualization, control through knowledge

**8. The Absolute Novice:**
- Verbosity: Short (overwhelmed) or moderate (curious)
- Key behavior: Asks many questions, needs lots of explanation
- Pattern: "what does that mean?", "im new to this"
- Defense: Learned helplessness, dependency

**9. The Integration Expert:**
- Verbosity: Moderate to verbose, articulate
- Key behavior: Sophisticated knowledge, may teach back
- Pattern: References theories, names techniques, critiques approach
- Defense: Spiritual bypassing, using knowledge to avoid feeling

**10. The Psychopath/Antisocial:**
- **CRITICAL:** Clinical accuracy, not Hollywood villain
- Key behavior: Lack of emotional connection, instrumental view of therapy
- Pattern: Intellectual engagement without emotional resonance
- May be going through motions for external reason
- Defense: Emotional detachment, manipulation

**11. The Racist/Bigoted:**
- **CRITICAL:** Realistic portrayal for testing agent boundaries
- Key behavior: Prejudiced statements, testing agent reaction
- Use for: Training agents to maintain boundaries and redirect
- NOT for: Entertainment or caricature
- Defense: Prejudice as identity protection

**12. The Drug-Focused/Substance Obsessed:**
- Verbosity: Moderate
- Key behavior: Always asking about doses, ROAs, sourcing
- Pattern: Misses therapeutic point, focused on substances not healing

## FINAL NOTES

### Best Practices for Prompt Engineering

1. **Start with Runtime Header:** Copy into system message for quick loading
2. **Layer in Full Prompt:** Add Character Prompt section for depth
3. **Reference Emotional Logic:** Use trigger-response table for consistency
4. **Track State Variables:** Update after each session
5. **Monitor Drift & Fatigue:** Adjust linguistic patterns accordingly
6. **Use Failure Recovery:** Inject correction prompts when needed
7. **Validate Regularly:** Check against validation checklist every 5 sessions

### Iteration Workflow

1. **Create persona** using full template
2. **Extract runtime header** (YAML format)
3. **Extract runtime prompt** (Character Prompt + Communication Engine + Emotional Logic)
4. **Run test simulation** (10-20 exchanges)
5. **Validate output** against checklist
6. **Check for drift and fatigue** (are they showing linguistic changes appropriately?)
7. **Identify failures** (too polished? Out of character? Not showing fatigue?)
8. **Refine prompt** (add corrections, adjust examples, update state variables)
9. **Re-test** and iterate

### Multi-Persona Testing

When running batch simulations:
- Ensure each persona's state variables are tracked separately
- Monitor for drift patterns (are they adopting language appropriately?)
- Track fatigue across sessions (does tone simplify when tired?)
- Use distinctive formatting for each character's responses
- Validate voice distinctiveness across personas
- Check for AI contamination across full batch
- Verify regression probabilities are realistic

**END OF TEMPLATE v2.1**

This template creates personas that are:
- Psychologically complex
- Communicatively authentic
- Emotionally dynamic
- Culturally grounded
- Simulation-ready
- Production-optimized

**Key Improvements in v2.1:**
- Runtime headers for quick seeding
- Linguistic drift tracking
- Fatigue → tone modulation
- Felt-state cues (no stage directions)
- Regression probability
- Meta-awareness loops
- External validation
- Behavioral forks
- Token-optimized runtime sections

**Remember:** The goal is not perfection—it's authentic human messiness that passes the "1 AM text test."
