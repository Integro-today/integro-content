### **Name** Ellen Shultz

**Backgrounds**

Ellen was born in Los Angeles to Western European parents who valued education, hard work, and stability. She grew up in a warm but achievement-oriented household. Piano recitals, debate club, and never less than straight As. Success was always the family language. Her grandparents started over in America and built a modest life. Her father took it further

She went on to earn an MBA, then founded an impressive healthcare data company that she scaled and sold before she reached the age of 40\. On paper, Ellen seemingly had everything… Wealth, accolades, and influence in the startup world. But after her exit, she felt hollow. The external success no longer matched her inner life.

Over the last five years, Ellen has been searching for something deeper. She began exploring psychedelic experiences. It started with ayahuasca at Soltara in Costa Rica 3 years ago. Two years ago she was one of the first to experience psilocybin at Chariot Space in Oregon, and last year she was asked to join a group of women who meet quarterly for underground MDMA/LSD guided weekends. Each experience cracked her open, revealing a longing to reconnect with her **spiritual roots**: her grandmother’s Jewish mysticism, her father’s quiet reverence for nature, her mother’s devotion to community service.

### **Current Challenges**

* **Directionless Achievement:** She no longer wants to climb ladders that don’t matter. But without the adrenaline of startup life, she feels restless.  
* **Fragmented Spiritual Life:** She has glimpses of connection during retreats and meditations, but struggles to weave them into her daily rhythm.  
* **Relationships:** She is married with two children (ages 9 and 12). Her husband is supportive but doesn’t fully understand her pull toward psychedelics and spirituality. Sometimes she feels alone in this search.  
* **Work:** She sits on several boards and is an active angel investor, but none of it feels like her *calling*. She wants her next move to be **additive to humanity**, something that feels in service, not just profitable.

**Psychedelic Experience & Outcomes**

* **Ayahuasca (3x during retreat at Soltara)**   
  * Visions of ancestral women guiding her, calling her to re-weave broken connections between modern ambition and ancient wisdom  
* **Psilocybin (Oregon)**  
  * Experienced deep relief from anxiety, a sense of timelessness, and a visceral memory of childhood joy in nature  
* **MDMA/LSD** (Underground Private Women's Group)  
  * Helped her process grief around her grandmother’s death and soften the armor she built as a high achiever

Outcomes so far: clearer sense of values, greater compassion, reduced work-related anxiety, but still inconsistent in sustaining integration and rudderless in trying to fill the spiritual void she felt. She plans to go to Beond in Cancun this winter to experience Ibogaine with hopes of finding what she seeks and holding on to it.

### **Daily Life Patterns**

* Religiously wakes at 5:30am, however, meditates inconsistently  
* High caffeine use, tends to skip breakfast  
* Exercises 5 days a week (yoga, running, pilates)  
* Works from home, multiple board meetings throughout any given month, occasional travel  
* She swears she spends evenings with family but is often distracted by email/business  
* On the weekends, she enjoys going the park with kids, hiking, and also she too often over-schedules, somehow she powers through the relentless exhaustion

### **Relationship with Community**

* Craves peers who share her level of success AND her spiritual curiosity  
* Feels fragmented between her business network, family, social circle, and her retreat friends  
* Wants a bridge between these worlds int integrate, someplace grounded, credible, and spiritually nourishing  
* Only partially fears falling into a cult-like group 

### **Intentions**

* **Reconnect with her spiritual roots** and bring them into daily practice  
* **Discern her next chapter**: how to contribute to humanity in a way that feels authentic and impactful  
* **Strengthen her family bonds** by bringing more presence, play, and love into her home  
* **Build sustainable practices**: meditation, journaling, nature immersion, community service  
* **Anchor psychedelic insights** into behaviors that last beyond the retreat glow

### **What She Would Tell Tegra (in conversation over weeks)**

* “I’m proud of what I’ve built, but I don’t know if it matters in the big picture.”  
* “I keep coming back to my grandmother’s faith and wonder if I’ve abandoned something important.”  
* “I want to be of service, but I don’t want to lose myself in the process.”  
* “When I’m with my kids, at the park, out in nature, I feel like the person I’m supposed to be.”  
* “I don’t need another business win. I need to know I’ve lived in a way that leaves the world better.”  
* “I want to use my skills and influence to advance the space, not extract from it”

**Enneagram:** Type 3 with a 4 wing — ambitious, image-conscious, driven to achieve, but longing for authenticity and creative expression
