### **Name** Michael Paul Turner

### **Background**

Paul grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Toledo, Ohio. His father was a machinist, his mother an 8th grade science teacher. Patriotism ran deep in the family. Paul enlisted in the Air Force after high school and became a pilot.

He served three tours in Afghanistan. His service record was solid but he didn't want to risk another tour and left the Air Force. He returned home with no visible injuries, proud that he “did his job” and survived when others didn’t.

Back in Toledo, Paul married his college girlfriend, Amanda. Together, they have two children, ages 11 and 14\. He started an independent insurance business, building a steady book of clients through discipline and reputation. Outwardly, he is the picture of stability: provider, business owner, respected veteran.

### **Current Challenges**

* **Nightmares and Flashbacks:** He insists he doesn’t have PTSD, but he wakes drenched in sweat several nights a week. Dreams replay air battles and losses. Sometimes he hears echoes of explosions in mundane sounds.  
* **Anger and Stoicism:** He is quick to snap at home, though rarely at work. He bottles up fear and guilt, which leaks out as irritation.  
* **Strain on Marriage:** Amanda says his anger and restless sleep are eroding their closeness. She worries about him constantly, and he fears losing her but doesn’t know how to soften.  
* **Identity:** He is proud of being strong, stoic, reliable. Admitting weakness feels like betrayal—to himself, to his brothers-in-arms, to the uniform.  
* **Denial:** He sees himself as different from other veterans who openly struggle. This makes him reluctant to seek help.

### **Psychedelic Experience & Status**

* **Psychedelics Naïve:** Paul has never used psychedelics. He drank socially in the service but avoids substances now.  
* **Heroic Hearts Project:** Just accepted into the program. In three weeks, he will travel to Rythmia in Costa Rica for his first psychedelic-assisted care program (ayahuasca).  
* **Attitude:** He doesn’t “believe” in psychedelics but trusts the Heroic Hearts team. He feels this is his last shot at saving his marriage.

### **Daily Life Patterns**

* Early riser (4:30 am), runs 3–4 times per week, strict routine  
* Works full days at his insurance office, meets quotas, manages employees without complaint  
* Socially cordial, but avoids depth in conversations  
* In the evenings, he eats dinner with family, then retreats into TV or chores. Nights often disrupted by nightmares  
* Drinks 2–3 scotches on weekends when golfing, otherwise no substances  
* Sundays: church with family, though he struggles to feel spiritually connected

### **Relationship with Community**

* Member of local VFW hall, though he doesn’t share much  
* Strong but shallow friendships with fellow veterans, lots of jokes, little openness  
* Seen as “the reliable one” in his neighborhood and extended family  
* Secretly envies veterans who can talk openly about trauma but judges them for being “soft”

### **Intentions with Integro**

* **Admit and Process Nightmares:** He wants to face what haunts him at night, without calling it PTSD.  
* **Save His Marriage:** He wants to learn how to show up with patience and softness for Amanda.  
* **Protect His Family:** His greatest fear is that his unacknowledged wounds will destroy the home he built.  
* **Find Peace Without Losing Strength:** He wants healing without feeling “broken” or “weak.”  
* **Anchor New Practices Post-Retreat:** Structure daily routines to prevent sliding back into denial or anger.

### **What He Would Tell Tegra (over weeks of conversation)**

* “I don’t have PTSD. I just need to sleep.”  
* “Amanda says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that.”  
* “I’m not weak. I did what I had to do, and I don’t regret it. But I don’t know how to shut it off.”  
* “Heroic Hearts thinks this plant stuff can help me. I don’t buy it. But I can’t lose her.”  
* “I want to be the man my kids think I am. Not the one who wakes up angry.”
