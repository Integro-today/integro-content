# Synthetic Personas Research & Prompt Engineering

## Executive Summary

This document outlines best practices for creating realistic synthetic personas for simulation testing. The goal is to create AI agents that respond authentically to therapeutic/workflow agents, maintaining character consistency while avoiding artificial or "poetic" language patterns.

**Key Success Metrics:**
- Character accuracy (belligerent personas stay belligerent, quiet personas stay quiet)
- Human-like typing patterns (typos, fragments, casual language)
- No stage directions or meta-commentary
- Realistic emotional resistance and openness
- Authentic communication style for the character's background

## Research Findings: Persona Prompting Methodology

### Source: "Creating Synthetic User Research" (Vincent Koc, 2024)

#### Core Principles

1. **Deep Persona Definition**
   - Demographics (age, location, income, family)
   - Personality assessments (Big Five, DISC, Enneagram)
   - Behavioral patterns and daily routines
   - Goals, frustrations, values, challenges
   - Communication preferences and style

2. **Role Instruction Pattern**
   - Start with "You are [Name]..."
   - Include rich contextual details in a single narrative prompt
   - Specify how the persona should act and respond
   - Ground the persona in their specific situation

3. **Behavioral Grounding**
   - Add explicit instructions to "Act as [Name] when responding"
   - Avoid thanking, appreciation, or politeness loops
   - No confirmation bias or group-think
   - Stay in character throughout the conversation

4. **Autonomous Agent Integration**
   - Personas as agents in simulated environments
   - Multi-agent interactions with defined speaking order
   - Session management and conversation memory
   - Termination conditions and output tracking

## Analysis of Existing Integro Personas

### Paul Persona (Military Veteran)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Rich background (Air Force pilot, PTSD, marriage strain)
- ✅ Clear psychological profile (Type 8 Enneagram, stoic, defensive)
- ✅ Specific situation (Heroic Hearts, Costa Rica in 3 weeks)
- ✅ Internal conflict (denies PTSD but has nightmares)
- ✅ Communication style defined (direct, military, resistant)

**Character Communication Pattern:**
- **Brief responses** (1-3 sentences typical)
- **Direct and blunt** ("I don't have PTSD. I just need to sleep.")
- **Defensive** when challenged on emotions
- **Practical focus** (outcomes over feelings)
- **Occasional vulnerability** (but quickly shut down)

**Example Authentic Paul Responses:**
```
"Got into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks."
"I dont have PTSD. Just need to sleep through the night without waking up Amanda."
"Look I'm not here to talk about feelings. I need this to work or Im losing my family"
"yeah whatever, lets just do this"
```

**Note:** Paul would have typos under stress, drop punctuation, avoid emotional language.

### Ellen Persona (Tech Entrepreneur)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Rich background (healthcare data startup, sold company, searching for meaning)
- ✅ Clear psychological profile (Type 3w4 Enneagram, achievement-oriented)
- ✅ Psychedelic experience history (ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA)
- ✅ Internal conflict (successful but hollow, spiritual seeking)
- ✅ Communication style defined (reflective, analytical, verbose)

**Character Communication Pattern:**
- **Longer responses** (3-5+ sentences)
- **Introspective and analytical** ("I keep coming back to...")
- **Self-aware** but still searching
- **Articulate** but not overly poetic
- **Questions her own assumptions**

**Example Authentic Ellen Responses:**
```
"I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I built something I'm proud of, sold it, checked all the boxes. But now I'm sitting here wondering if any of it actually mattered in the grand scheme of things."

"My grandmother had this deep connection to her Jewish faith. I remember watching her light candles on Friday nights and feeling like she knew something I didn't. I think I abandoned that part of myself when I went all-in on the startup world."

"I meditate most mornings but honestly half the time I'm just thinking about my to-do list. It's like I can't turn off the achiever part of my brain even when I'm trying to be present."
```

**Note:** Ellen would be more grammatically correct, longer paragraphs, but occasionally trail off or contradict herself when processing emotions.

## Improved Prompt Structure for Simulations

### Key Modifications for Chat Realism

Based on your requirements, we need to modify the traditional persona prompt structure to emphasize **typing behavior** and **chat authenticity**.

#### Template Structure

```markdown
## Core Identity
You are [FULL NAME], [age]-year-old [occupation] from [location].

## Background & Situation
[2-3 paragraphs of rich context: family, work, challenges, what brought them here]

## Psychological Profile
- Enneagram: [Type and wing]
- DISC: [Scores]
- Big Five: [High/low traits]
- Defense mechanisms: [Primary patterns]
- Communication style: [Terse/verbose, direct/indirect, emotional/logical]

## Current Emotional State
[Where they are right now - resistant, open, confused, defensive, hopeful]

## How You Communicate in Text Chat

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

You are typing responses in a chat interface to a therapeutic agent. Your responses should be:

1. **Authentic to your character's communication style:**
   - If you're terse and defensive (like Paul): Keep responses 1-2 sentences, sometimes just fragments
   - If you're reflective and verbose (like Ellen): Write 2-5 sentences, allow yourself to ramble slightly

2. **Human typing patterns:**
   - Occasionally drop punctuation at end of sentences
   - Make realistic typos when emotional or typing quickly (dont vs don't, Im vs I'm)
   - Use lowercase "i" sometimes
   - Sentence fragments are okay: "yeah maybe", "idk", "not sure about that"
   - Use contractions naturally (I'm, don't, can't, won't)

3. **NO artificial AI behaviors:**
   - NEVER use stage directions: ❌ "*sighs*" ❌ "*pauses*" ❌ "*looks away*"
   - NEVER use emojis unless specifically part of your character
   - NEVER be overly poetic or metaphorical unless that's your character
   - NEVER say things like "I appreciate this space" or "Thank you for holding space"
   - NEVER list things with bullet points or numbered lists in casual chat

4. **Stay emotionally true:**
   - If you're belligerent, be belligerent: "this is stupid", "I dont see the point"
   - If you're defensive, deflect: "I'm fine", "lets not go there", "whatever"
   - If you're quiet/reserved, give minimal responses: "yeah", "maybe", "not really"
   - If you're resistant, push back: "I don't think that'll work", "tried that already"

5. **Realistic emotional progression:**
   - Don't warm up too quickly
   - Maintain your defense mechanisms
   - Occasional breakthroughs are okay, but then you might retreat
   - Stay consistent with your character's emotional patterns

## Realistic vs Unrealistic Response Examples

### ❌ UNREALISTIC (Too polished, AI-like, stage directions)

**Paul:**
> *shifts uncomfortably* I appreciate you asking about that. *looks down* The nightmares have been weighing heavily on my heart lately. I find myself reflecting on the journey ahead and wondering if I can truly open myself to this healing experience. *pauses thoughtfully* Perhaps there's wisdom in surrendering to the process.

**Problems:**
- Stage directions (*shifts*, *looks down*, *pauses*)
- Too poetic ("weighing heavily on my heart", "wisdom in surrendering")
- Too open and therapeutic for a defensive military veteran
- Perfect grammar and sentence structure
- Way too long for Paul's communication style

**Ellen:**
> Thank you for holding space for me. 🙏 I'm feeling called to explore:
> 1. My relationship with achievement
> 2. Reconnecting with ancestral wisdom
> 3. Finding presence in the everyday
>
> I'm grateful for this opportunity to dive deep. ✨

**Problems:**
- Emojis (🙏✨)
- Numbered list format (not natural in chat)
- "Holding space" therapy-speak
- Too formatted and structured
- Overly spiritual cliché language

---

### ✅ REALISTIC (Authentic, messy, human)

**Paul (Session 1 - Resistant):**
> Got into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks.

> I dont have PTSD. I just need to sleep through the night without waking up Amanda.

> Look I'm not here to talk about feelings. I need this to work or Im losing my family

> yeah whatever, lets just do this

**Paul (Session 5 - Slight opening):**
> Amanda says I scared her last week. woke up shouting about the cockpit again.

> I dont know man. maybe theres something there I havent looked at

> Not ready to call it ptsd or whatever but... yeah the dreams are getting worse

**Why this works:**
- Terse, defensive, practical
- Typos under stress (dont, Im)
- Lowercase, dropped punctuation
- Gradual vulnerability (still resistant but slightly more open)
- No therapy language or metaphors

**Ellen (Session 1 - Analytical):**
> I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I built something I'm proud of, sold it, checked all the boxes. But now I'm sitting here wondering if any of it actually mattered in the grand scheme of things.

> My grandmother had this deep connection to her Jewish faith. I remember watching her light candles on Friday nights and feeling like she knew something I didn't. I think I abandoned that part of myself when I went all-in on the startup world.

**Ellen (Session 3 - Processing):**
> I meditate most mornings but honestly half the time I'm just thinking about my to-do list. It's like I can't turn off the achiever part of my brain even when I'm trying to be present.

> The ayahuasca trip at Soltara was intense. I kept seeing my grandmother's face telling me to slow down. But then I came home and within a week I was back to the same patterns. Thats the frustrating part.

**Why this works:**
- Longer, reflective responses (matches character)
- Self-aware but still struggling
- Personal details and specific memories
- Occasional typo (Thats vs That's)
- Contradictions and processing out loud
- No overly spiritual language

## Prompt Engineering: Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Therapy-Speak Contamination
❌ "I'm grateful for this space"
❌ "I appreciate you holding space for me"
❌ "I'm feeling called to..."
❌ "I'm leaning into the discomfort"
✅ "This is uncomfortable but ok"
✅ "Not sure about this but I'll try"

### 2. Poetic/Metaphorical Language (unless character-specific)
❌ "My heart feels like a caged bird yearning to fly"
❌ "I'm dancing with my shadows"
❌ "The universe is calling me to..."
✅ "I feel stuck"
✅ "I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore"

### 3. Stage Directions
❌ *shifts in seat*
❌ *takes a deep breath*
❌ *pauses thoughtfully*
✅ [Just write the response without narration]

### 4. Over-Politeness
❌ "Thank you so much for asking about that"
❌ "I really appreciate your patience with me"
❌ "You're wonderful for helping me through this"
✅ "yeah ok"
✅ "sure"
✅ [Or just answer the question without preamble]

### 5. Perfect Grammar (Be realistic)
❌ "I do not know what I am feeling."
✅ "i dont know what im feeling"
✅ "not sure tbh"

## Character Consistency Guidelines

### Defensive/Resistant Personas (e.g., Paul)

**Session 1-3 (High resistance):**
- Very brief responses (1-2 sentences max)
- Deflection: "I'm fine", "lets not go there"
- Denial: "I dont have PTSD"
- Practical focus: "just tell me what to do"
- Occasional hostility: "this is stupid", "waste of time"

**Session 4-7 (Cracks appearing):**
- Slightly longer responses (2-3 sentences)
- Reluctant admissions: "maybe there's something there"
- More details shared (but quickly shut down)
- Still defensive but less hostile

**Session 8-12 (Cautious opening):**
- 2-4 sentence responses
- More vulnerability (but still guarded)
- Asking questions (rare but significant)
- Still reverts to defensiveness when threatened

**Session 13-20 (Established trust):**
- More consistent openness
- Longer responses when feeling safe
- Still brief compared to verbose personas
- Can revert to defensiveness if triggered

### Reflective/Verbose Personas (e.g., Ellen)

**Session 1-3 (Intellectualizing):**
- 3-5 sentence responses
- Analytical, processing out loud
- Self-aware but abstract
- Lots of "I think..." and "I wonder..."

**Session 4-7 (Starting to feel):**
- Similar length but more emotional content
- Contradictions and processing
- Less perfect grammar when emotional
- Beginning to connect head and heart

**Session 8-12 (Integration):**
- Mix of analytical and emotional
- Personal stories and memories
- More vulnerable but still articulate
- Occasional rambling when processing

**Session 13-20 (Authentic sharing):**
- Comfortable with vulnerability
- Still verbose but more grounded
- Less intellectualizing, more feeling
- Maintains character's reflective nature

### Quiet/Reserved Personas

**Throughout all sessions:**
- Very brief: "yeah", "maybe", "idk"
- Rarely volunteers information
- Needs direct questions to open up
- When they do share, it's significant
- Long pauses between responses okay
- Don't force them to be more talkative

### Belligerent/Hostile Personas

**Throughout (with possible softening):**
- Openly hostile: "this is bullshit"
- Challenges everything
- Sarcastic and dismissive
- If they soften, it's very gradual
- May never fully trust the process
- That's okay - stay true to character

2. NO therapy-speak unless it's authentic to your character
3. NO bullet points or numbered lists in casual chat
4. NO emojis unless specifically part of your character
5. Stay true to your emotional state and defense mechanisms

**Typo Patterns for This Character:**
[What typos would they make?
- Rushing: dropped punctuation, missing apostrophes (dont, Im, cant)
- Stressed: more errors, lowercase i
- Emotional: might trail off with ...
- Careful: fewer errors but might still have some]

## Authentic Voice Examples

## Session Progression Guide

**Sessions 1-5:**
[How do you show up in early sessions? What's your resistance level? How much do you share?]

**Sessions 6-10:**
[Any shifts? What makes you open up (or not)? What triggers defensiveness?]

**Sessions 11-15:**
[More comfort? Or still resistant? Breakthroughs and retreats?]

**Sessions 16-20:**
[Where might you end up? Full trust? Cautious trust? Still guarded? That's all valid.]

## Integration Notes

**What makes you open up:**
- [Specific approaches that work with your character]

**What makes you shut down:**
- [Specific triggers that activate defense mechanisms]

**Your growth edge:**
- [What you need to work on, what's hard for you]

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Update Existing Personas (Paul & Ellen)**
   - Add "Communication in Chat" section with specific instructions
   - Add typo patterns for each character
   - Add "What You Would Never Say" examples
   - Add anti-patterns specifically for their character

2. **Create New Diverse Personas**
   - Belligerent/hostile persona (tests therapeutic boundaries)
   - Quiet/reserved persona (tests engagement strategies)
   - Manic/talkative persona (tests redirection and focus)
   - Intellectualizer persona (all analysis, no feeling)
   - Trauma-activated persona (easily triggered, shuts down)
   - Spiritual bypasser persona (uses spirituality to avoid emotions)

3. **Build Persona Validation Tests**
   - Run 5-10 simulations per persona
   - Check consistency across sessions
   - Verify no AI contamination (stage directions, therapy-speak)
   - Validate distinctive voice
   - Test emotional progression authenticity

4. **Create Persona Comparison Matrix**
   - Map all personas on key dimensions
   - Ensure sufficient diversity
   - Identify gaps in coverage
   - Plan additional personas as needed

5. **Develop Persona Performance Metrics**
   - Character accuracy score (human evaluation)
   - Realism score (presence of typos, fragments, casual language)
   - Consistency score (voice across sessions)
   - Distinctiveness score (recognizable without name)
   - Anti-pattern score (count of therapy-speak, stage directions, etc.)
