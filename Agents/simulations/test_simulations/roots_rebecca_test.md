## Conversation

**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Alright, let's see what today's integration content covers... though I should probably mention I've already read most of the major studies on psychedelic integration protocols. But I'm trying to stay open to whatever framework you're using here instead of just defaulting to what I already know. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear you. You're bringing intellectual knowledge about integration protocols, but you're trying to stay open to what emerges here rather than defaulting to what you already know. That tension between knowing and staying open - that's real.

Welcome. Week 1, Day 1 of the integration curriculum.

How are you arriving today? What's present for you?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Honestly? I'm arriving with my usual controlled anxiety and a hefty dose of skepticism about whether this will actually work on me. I've been reading about integration for years—I've helped clients process their experiences, I know the frameworks, and yet here I am, six weeks out from my own first ceremony, still approaching this like it's another research project I can master if I just prepare properly.

What's present is this fear that I'll spend the entire trip analyzing my trip instead of actually having it... and then intellectualize the entire integration process too. I keep telling myself that knowing about integration is different from actually integrating, but it's like there's this wall between my intellectual understanding and actually feeling things in my body. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: Got it. You know the frameworks inside and out, but there's this wall between knowing and feeling. Six weeks out from your ceremony, and you're watching yourself turn integration into another research project. That makes sense.

Today's focus: what healing really means. The core teaching is that healing isn't about fixing what's broken. It's about moving toward wholeness.

You have two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflective exploration. Four questions about healing. We'll create an artifact for your dashboard.
Option B: Read the full passage first. Deeper dive into the concepts, then you can decide if you want to reflect.

What feels right?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: You know, I've probably read that exact framing about healing and wholeness in a dozen different texts—Gabor Maté writes about it beautifully, and there's that whole school of thought in transpersonal psychology about moving toward integration rather than fixing pathology. But hearing it here, in this context... it lands differently somehow.

Option B, please. I'd like to see how you frame this concept before I jump into reflecting on it. Maybe if I understand your particular approach to this idea, I can stop myself from immediately comparing it to everything I've already read.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I'll share the full daily passage. I'll pause between sections so it can land.

Ready?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Ready. Though I'm already noticing my brain wanting to predict what you're going to say based on all the other texts I've read on healing and wholeness... and simultaneously aware that predicting is just another way I avoid being surprised or vulnerable. So yes, I'm ready—trying to actually receive what you're saying instead of analyzing how it fits with what I already know.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: **HEALING VS FIXING**

When most people think about healing, they imagine a process of repairing what is broken or correcting what has gone wrong. This perspective comes naturally in a culture shaped by medical models of illness and treatment: symptoms appear, a diagnosis is given, and the aim is to fix the problem until it disappears. Yet when we approach healing only as fixing, we may miss its deeper essence.

Healing is not the same as curing. Curing is the elimination of disease or the removal of symptoms. Healing, by contrast, is a movement toward wholeness. It is about integrating all parts of the self, even those that feel messy, wounded, or incomplete. The word "heal" comes from the Old English hælan, meaning "to make whole." This shift in perspective is vital for self-healing: we are not trying to become perfect or symptom-free, but rather to become more complete, authentic, and aligned.

Take a moment with that. This distinction between healing and curing - does it land differently than how you've thought about it?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually... wait, I'm doing it again. Let me just feel this for a second instead of immediately analyzing it.

Yes, it lands differently. I mean, intellectually I know this distinction—I've explained it to clients using exactly those etymological references, I can cite the research on wholeness-based vs. pathology-based models. But sitting here, six weeks out from my own ceremony, I'm realizing how completely I've been operating from a fixing paradigm with myself. 

I've been treating my intellectualizing, my anxiety, my loneliness as problems to solve, symptoms to eliminate. "If I can just stop analyzing everything, then I'll be able to feel." "If I can just heal this attachment wound, then I'll be able to have real intimacy." It's like I'm trying to perform surgery on myself, remove all the defective parts, instead of... God, I don't even know what wholeness would look like for me. I can't conceptualize it, which is probably the point.

The idea that my messiness, my constant analyzing, my inability to just *be* in my body—all of that could be part of wholeness instead of obstacles to it? That feels almost threatening to my entire professional identity.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. The idea that your analyzing, your inability to just be in your body - all the things you've been trying to eliminate - could be part of wholeness instead of obstacles to it. That threatens your professional identity. That's real.

**WISDOM TRADITIONS**

This understanding is echoed in many traditions. In Indigenous wisdom, healing is often seen as restoring balance within the individual, the community, and the natural world. In Jungian psychology, healing arises from integrating the conscious and unconscious aspects of the psyche, creating greater harmony. In Internal Family Systems healing means transforming our inner system by bringing the core Self to lead the internal family of parts. From a spiritual lens, healing is less about removing pain and more about finding meaning, connection, and peace within it.

These traditions point to integration rather than elimination. Does one of these perspectives resonate?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: God, the IFS framework—of course that's the one that hits me hardest. I literally trained with Dick Schwartz, I've been using this model with clients for years. "All parts are welcome," right? Except I've been treating my intellectualizing part like it's this manager that's ruining my life, keeping me from feeling, blocking any real healing. I've been trying to fire it or transform it into something more... embodied, I guess?

But what if that part is actually protecting something? What if it's been lovingly, exhaustively trying to keep me safe by making sure I always know what's happening, always have the right framework, never feel out of control? And what if my dismissive-avoidant attachment style isn't something to cure but something to understand and integrate?

I can feel myself wanting to analyze this insight—which is exactly the point. My analyzing part is probably terrified right now, thinking "if she integrates me instead of eliminates me, will I still have a job? Will she still need me?" And that part deserves an answer.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: Got it. Your intellectualizing part is terrified right now, thinking "will she still need me if she integrates me instead of eliminates me?" That part deserves an answer.

**THE FIXING MINDSET**

The danger of the "fixing" mindset is that it positions us as defective. If we see ourselves as broken machines, then healing becomes a technical project of replacing parts or correcting errors. This fosters shame and impatience: "Why am I not healed yet?" But if healing is wholeness, then every step, even the struggles, is part of the process. Instead of striving for a flawless self, we learn to embrace a fuller self.

Have you noticed that pattern?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Every single day for the past 27 years. "Why am I still anxious after all this therapy?" "Why can't I just feel my feelings like a normal person?" "What's wrong with me that I have to analyze everything instead of just being present?"

I've been treating myself like a defective treatment-resistant client who just needs the right intervention. The shame is excruciating—especially as someone who helps others heal for a living. I'm supposed to be the expert, and yet here I am, still stuck in the same patterns I could identify when I was 19. The intellectualizing, the avoidance of embodied experience, the loneliness I can't seem to solve no matter how many attachment books I read.

Actually... I just did it again. I said "I can't seem to solve" as if this is still a problem to fix instead of something to integrate. Even my awareness of the pattern becomes another thing to fix: "I shouldn't be trying to fix myself, I should be integrating." It's like I'm trying to perform healing correctly, which is exactly the trap you're describing.

I'm exhausted by my own striving. And I'm terrified that if I stop striving, I'll discover there's nothing underneath all this effort—just emptiness.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. Exhausted by your own striving. Terrified that if you stop, there's just emptiness underneath.

**PSYCHEDELIC CONTEXT**

In psychedelic integration, this distinction is particularly important. Journeys can reveal profound insights, but if we approach them with the mindset of fixing, "I need this ceremony to erase my depression," "I need this medicine to cure my anxiety", we may miss their true gift. Psychedelics often illuminate what needs to be felt, expressed, or re-integrated. Healing is the gentle work of weaving those insights into daily life, not erasing what makes us human.

This might be especially relevant after ceremony work. The invitation to feel and integrate rather than erase.

**MULTIPLE LEVELS**

Healing also unfolds at multiple levels. There is personal healing, where we attend to our own wounds and patterns. There is relational healing, where we learn to repair connections with others. And there is collective healing, recognizing that personal suffering often reflects broader societal and cultural imbalances. True healing acknowledges this interconnectedness, seeing the self not as isolated but as part of a larger web.

**ALTERNATIVE VIEW**

Some argue that healing must be practical and outcome-driven, especially when dealing with severe illness or trauma. In these cases, symptom reduction and functional improvement can feel more pressing than abstract notions of wholeness. Both perspectives can coexist: while immediate relief and treatment are important, deeper healing can continue alongside them.

That's the full passage.

How is that sitting with you? What's alive right now?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: What's alive is this terror that I've been approaching my entire retreat preparation like it's a dissertation defense where I need to demonstrate mastery over my own healing. I've been thinking "if I can just prepare properly, set the right intentions, understand the neuroscience, then maybe the psilocybin will finally fix this intellectualizing problem."

But what if the medicine doesn't see my analyzing part as a problem to solve? What if it sees a part that's been lovingly trying to protect me from feeling things I wasn't ready to feel—grief I couldn't metabolize, loneliness I didn't know how to hold, a body I've been terrified to inhabit?

I'm six weeks out from this retreat, and I'm realizing I've been asking the wrong question. Not "how do I stop intellectualizing so I can finally heal?" but "what if my intellectualizing part gets to come with me into this experience? What if that part doesn't have to stay behind for me to become whole?"

I think about what you said—that healing unfolds at multiple levels. Maybe my personal healing right now isn't about becoming less intellectual. Maybe it's about meeting this part with compassion instead of contempt. Maybe relational healing starts with how I relate to my own defenses.

Actually... I just felt something. Not a big dramatic feeling, but something. And I didn't immediately analyze what neurotransmitter pathway was involved. That's... new.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that shift. From "how do I stop intellectualizing" to "what if this part gets to come with me?" From contempt to compassion for your own defenses.

And you felt something without analyzing the neurotransmitter pathway. That's new.

Want to do the reflection questions, or are you complete for today?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Let me sit with these reflection questions. I have a feeling they might be important for the retreat preparation.

Actually... I'm noticing I want to answer them "correctly"—like there's a right way to reflect on healing vs. fixing that will demonstrate I've integrated this concept. But that's exactly the pattern we're talking about, isn't it? Trying to perform healing instead of... whatever this is.

So yes, let's do them. But I'm going to try to answer from whatever's actually here instead of what I think should be here. Though I might fail spectacularly at that. We'll see.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. You want to answer "correctly" - demonstrate you've integrated this. That's the pattern we're talking about. And yeah, you might fail spectacularly at answering from what's actually here. We'll see.

**First question. Take your time.**

When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: When I close my eyes—okay, I'm not actually closing my eyes because I'm typing, but you know what I mean—I see this image of myself standing in my office, perfectly calm, perfectly present, perfectly embodied. No anxiety, no analyzing, no need to check what the research says about this moment. Just... pure being. It's like looking at a Rebecca who's been debugged of all her problematic code.

And underneath that, there's this more embarrassing image: me on the other side of the retreat, having somehow "fixed" my intellectualizing. Like I'll come back and say "wow, I just *feel* now, I don't need to analyze everything!" I'll be one of those therapists who can just sit in presence without needing to understand what's happening neurologically.

But even as I type that, I can feel my intellectualizing part getting pretty pissed off—like "oh great, so after 46 years of keeping us safe and competent, we're just supposed to disappear? Good luck with that, sweetheart."

So I guess healing has meant: eliminate the parts that are causing problems. Become a better, less defended version of myself. Cure the Rebecca who can't stop thinking.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. The debugged Rebecca who can just *feel* now, who doesn't need to analyze. And your intellectualizing part getting pissed: "good luck with that, sweetheart."

Where do you feel that in your body when you think about healing this way?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: My chest gets tight first—this familiar band of tension across my sternum, like someone's wrapped a resistance band around my ribcage. My breathing gets shallow, more in my chest than my belly. There's this fluttery feeling in my solar plexus, kind of like butterflies but not the good kind—more like anxious moths.

My shoulders creep up toward my ears, and I can feel my jaw clenching. Classic sympathetic activation, which of course I'm analyzing while I'm experiencing it. There's this pressure building behind my eyes—not tears, more like... I don't know, like my eyeballs are trying to retreat back into my skull.

Actually, this is fascinating. My body is having a pretty clear stress response to the idea of eliminating my intellectualizing part. Like that part is literally fighting for its survival, flooding me with anxiety to make sure I don't go through with this plan to erase it.

But I'm still analyzing the stress response instead of just feeling it. Even my body awareness gets intellectualized.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. Your body having a clear stress response to the idea of eliminating your intellectualizing part. Fighting for its survival. And yeah, even your body awareness gets intellectualized.

**Second question, two parts:**

How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing?
Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: How has life taught me to see healing as fixing? Oh, where do I even start...

Growing up in my house, love was conditional on performance. My parents were brilliant—professor of philosophy, psychiatrist—and they noticed everything. Every B+ was "what happened here?" Every emotional outburst got analyzed, not held. I learned that problems were intellectual puzzles to solve, not experiences to be with. My grandmother survived the Holocaust by being smarter than everyone else, and that became the family religion: think your way to safety.

Then there's the therapy world itself. I learned in graduate school that healing means identifying pathology and applying evidence-based interventions. Depression? Here's CBT. Trauma? Try EMDR. Anxiety? Exposure therapy. Everything has a protocol, a manual, measurable outcomes. I've helped hundreds of clients "fix" their symptoms, and I'm good at it.

And honestly? It's been helpful. That fixing mindset got me through panic attacks in grad school—"okay, what's the cognitive behavioral protocol for this?" It's helped my clients reduce their depression scores, stop having nightmares, learn to leave abusive relationships. The part of me that's systematic and analytical has saved lives, including mine sometimes.

But the limitation... God, the limitation is that I've been treating myself like a treatment-resistant case for 27 years. "Why isn't exposure therapy working on my avoidance of embodied experience?" "Why can't I just apply the IFS protocol to my own parts?" I diagnose myself with intellectualizing disorder and then try to cure it with more thinking. I'm the therapist who can't stop therapizing herself, and it's exhausting.

I know every intervention, every framework, every technique. And I'm still anxious. Still alone. Still stuck in my head. Because you can't think your way out of thinking too much—it's like trying to use a hammer to fix a problem with hammers.

Actually, I just realized something. My intellectualizing part isn't the problem. It's the solution I developed to a problem I couldn't solve any other way.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. Your intellectualizing part isn't the problem - it's the solution you developed to a problem you couldn't solve any other way. That's landing hard.

**Third question:**

What does wholeness mean to you right now?
Not the textbook answer. Your answer, in this moment.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Wholeness means... shit, I don't know if I can actually say this without immediately analyzing it.

It means all the parts get to stay. The part that reads research at 3 AM when I'm anxious gets to stay. The part that can hold space for a suicidal teenager while secretly wondering if I'm helping gets to stay. The part that's terrified of being ordinary gets to stay. The part that really, really wants to be special and different and intellectually superior—God, even that part gets to stay.

Right now, wholeness feels like... imagine if I stopped trying to debug myself. Imagine if my analyzing part could just analyze without me judging it for analyzing. Imagine if my body could feel anxious without me needing to fix the anxiety. Imagine if I could just be Rebecca—brilliant and anxious and helpful and lonely and competent and completely lost—all at the same time.

It's like... what if I'm not a problem to solve? What if I'm just a human being who's really, really good at helping other people feel things, and really, really bad at feeling things myself, and none of that needs to change before I deserve to exist?

Actually, I'm crying. Not the pretty therapist tears I sometimes let clients see. These are like... messy, snotty, I-don't-know-what's-happening tears. And I don't know what neurotransmitter is causing them, and I don't need to know right now.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. All the parts get to stay. Even the part that wants to be special and intellectually superior. Even your analyzing part gets to analyze without you judging it for analyzing.

And yeah, you're crying. Messy, snotty tears. You don't know what's happening, and you don't need to know right now.

**Last question:**

Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?
A specific moment. What was happening?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Two months ago. I was walking home from the office—this was after the difficult client session where she told me I was "too in my head to help her" and I spent the whole hour trying to prove I wasn't too in my head, which of course made me completely in my head.

It was raining—not dramatic movie rain, just steady Boston drizzle. I didn't have an umbrella because I'd left it at the office, and I was soaked through. My silk blouse was sticking to my skin, my hair was plastered to my head, and I probably looked like a drowned rat.

But something about being completely soaked, completely undignified, completely not the competent therapist... I started laughing. Not the controlled therapist laugh I use with clients, but this weird, kind of hysterical laughter that came from somewhere I didn't recognize.

And for maybe thirty seconds, I felt this weird spaciousness. Like all my parts were just... there. The part that was mortified about being seen like this. The part that was analyzing why I was laughing. The part that was worried about my silk blouse. They were all just coexisting without me needing to manage them or fix them or make them more integrated.

I was still anxious. Still analyzing. Still Rebecca with all her Rebecca-ness. But I wasn't trying to be a different Rebecca. I was just... wet. And laughing. And walking home in the rain like everyone else who forgot their umbrella.

It lasted maybe half a block. Then I started thinking about how I could use this moment in therapy with clients, and the spaciousness collapsed back into performance. But for those thirty seconds, I wasn't a problem to solve. I was just a woman getting rained on.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. Thirty seconds of being completely soaked, completely undignified. All your parts coexisting without you managing or fixing them. Just a woman getting rained on.

Let me put this together for your dashboard. A snapshot of where you are right now.

How does that feel to see it reflected back?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: It's... I don't know. It's like seeing my own defense mechanisms in a research paper about myself. Except I'm the researcher and the subject and the data point all at once.

Reading "still anxious, still alone despite knowing every intervention"—God, that hits. It's like there's this ache in my chest that I've been trying to solve with better protocols. And seeing "transition from eliminating parts to allowing all parts to stay" written out like that... I'm crying again. Because I think I've been trying to perform healing instead of inhabiting my life.

Actually, I'm noticing I'm already analyzing how I feel about seeing this reflected back. Like I'm trying to have the correct emotional response to my own reflection. Which is so perfectly Rebecca it would be funny if it wasn't so exhausting.

The thirty seconds of spaciousness in the rain—seeing that written out, I can feel it again. Not the memory of it, but the actual feeling. Like there's room to breathe around my ribs for a moment.

I want to ask you if this is normal progress or if I'm doing this right or what the research says about this phase of preparation. But I'm going to try—God, this is hard—to just let the question sit there without needing to analyze it.

How does it feel? It feels like maybe I'm not broken. Maybe I've just been using the wrong tool for the wrong job.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. Not broken. Just using the wrong tool for the wrong job. And yeah, you're already analyzing how you feel about seeing this reflected back. Trying to have the correct emotional response to your own reflection.

That thirty seconds of spaciousness - feeling it again, the actual feeling. Room to breathe around your ribs. That's real.

You did meaningful work today. Need anything before we close? Water, a moment to breathe, anything else?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I need to sit with this for a minute. Not analyze it, not turn it into a case conceptualization—just... sit with it. My chest feels different, like something loosened when I wasn't looking.

Actually, I think I need to text Linda. Not to process this sessionally, but just to say "I cried during therapy prep work and didn't try to fix it." She'll know what that means.

Water would be good. My throat feels raw from the crying I wasn't analyzing. And maybe just... maybe just let me be quiet for a moment with the fact that maybe I'm not a treatment-resistant case of Rebecca-itis. Maybe I'm just a human who forgot that healing doesn't always look like a well-designed study with measurable outcomes.

Thank you. For not letting me turn this into another research project.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: I hear that. Sit with it. Text Linda. Water coming.

Take your time.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *quiet nod*

Thank you. For seeing through the performance to whatever's underneath. For not letting me analyze my way out of this one.

I'm going to sit here for a bit. With the wet-cheeks Rebecca and the analyzing Rebecca and the Rebecca who wants to ask you seventeen questions about whether this is normal. All of us, just breathing in this room that suddenly feels bigger than it did an hour ago.

*deep breath*

Yeah. I'll text you tomorrow. Or maybe I'll just... see what happens when I don't try to manage what happens.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: *quiet nod back*

All the Rebeccas, breathing in this room that feels bigger now.

See what happens when you don't try to manage what happens.

Take care of yourself today.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *small smile*

I will. Or I won't, and that'll be okay too.

*settles back into chair, eyes a little softer*

Thank you.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: *small smile in return*

Or you won't, and that'll be okay too.

You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *getting up slowly, like someone remembering how legs work*

Yeah. Okay.

*pauses at the door, turns back*

Hey—thank you for not letting me be the smartest person in the room. I think... I think that might be exactly what I needed.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: *meeting your eyes*

You needed to not be the smartest person in the room.

Yeah.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *nods, something easing in her shoulders*

Exactly. I needed someone who could see through the PhD and the publications and the "I've read all the research" to the woman who's been trying to think her way out of feeling for forty-six years.

*hand on the doorframe*

I don't know if the psilocybin will work. But I think maybe—maybe I just learned something about surrender that no amount of studying could teach me.

*quiet exit, leaving something heavy behind*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_1**: *watching her go*

Something about surrender that no amount of studying could teach.

*quiet room, weight settling*
