  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I have an ibogaine retreat coming up at Beond in a few weeks, and... honestly, I'm hoping this might be the one that finally sticks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each time I get these beautiful glimpses of what matters, but then I come home and within a month I'm back to the same patterns. Checking email during dinner, saying yes to every board request, waking up at 5:30 just to cram more productivity into the day.\n\nMy grandmother used to say I was running from something, but she never told me what. Maybe it's time I found out.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Breaking the pattern of losing insights after ceremonies\n2. Being present during meals instead of checking email\n3. Understanding what you're actually running from\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly right. It's like you pulled the thoughts right out of my head that I haven't even said out loud to anyone.\n\nI guess the first one feels most urgent - I'm tired of these beautiful revelations just evaporating. It's like building a sandcastle and watching the tide wash it away, over and over.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I integrate and embody the insights from my ceremonies\n2. I show up fully present during meals with others\n3. I face and understand what drives my constant motion\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user2": "The first one - the integration. Without that, the other two don't even have a chance to happen. I've been chasing peak experiences like they're achievements to collect, but I'm not doing the work to bring them home. My kids deserve more than a mother who's physically there but mentally drafting emails about healthcare data analytics.\n\nI want this time to be different. I want whatever ibogaine shows me to actually change how I live, not just what I believe when I'm sitting in ceremony.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I integrate and embody the insights from my ceremonies\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The second one... showing up during meals. That one hits hard because I can see my daughter watching me when I \"just quickly check\" something. She's started bringing her tablet to dinner too, and I know where she learned that. But it feels almost impossible some days - like if I don't respond immediately, everything will fall apart.\n\nThe third one about my constant motion... I'm scared of what I'll find if I stop. My grandmother used to rock in her chair for hours, just... being. I used to think she was wasting time. Now I wonder if she knew something I don't.",
  "system4": "Your 3 intentions:\n\n1. I integrate and embody the insights from my ceremonies\n2. I show up fully present during meals with my daughter\n3. I discover what exists in the stillness I've been running from\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them in the front of my journal - the one I bought after that psilocybin session in Oregon and never really used. Maybe this time I'll actually fill it with something worth remembering.\n\nI keep thinking about what my grandmother would say about all this. She'd probably just smile and tell me to stop talking and start listening. Maybe that's what I'm finally ready to do.",
  "system5": "The journal's been waiting for you. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "*deep breath* \n\nYeah. It has been waiting, hasn't it? Three years of beautiful insights gathering dust on a shelf while I kept chasing the next thing, the next ceremony, the next achievement. \n\nI'm scared. But I'm ready to stop running.",
  "system6": "That's the work. Trust what you've set.",
  "user6": "I will. \n\nI don't know how to do this part - the sitting with it, the trusting - but I said I would, so I will.",
  "system7": "Good. The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user7": "I hope so. I really hope so.",
  "system8": "You've done your part. Let it do its work.",
  "user8": "Okay. I'm... ready to let go now.",
  "system9": "*deep breath*",
  "user9": "*exhales slowly*\n\nI feel like I'm standing at the edge of something vast. All these years of building, achieving, climbing... and now I'm just supposed to sit still and see what finds me?\n\nMy hands are shaking a little. But I'm still here. Still breathing.",
  "system10": "Still breathing is enough. The rest will come.",
  "user10": "Still breathing. That's all I've got right now.",
  "system11": "That's everything.",
  "user11": "Everything... feels impossibly small and impossibly huge at the same time.",
  "system12": "Hold both. The medicine knows how to work with that.",
  "user12": "Hold both. Yeah... I can do that. I've been doing that my whole life, haven't I? The small details and the big picture. The spreadsheets and the sacred. \n\nMy grandmother used to say \"hold the thread, not just the tapestry.\" I never really got it until now.",
  "system13": "She gave you the compass. Now trust what you hold.",
  "user13": "The thread\u2019s slipping through my fingers. I keep trying to grip tighter, but maybe that\u2019s the wrong move.",
  "system14": "Stop gripping. Let it rest in your palm.",
  "user14": "*opens hand slowly*\n\nIt's still there. Just... resting. Like it was waiting for me to stop trying to control it.",
  "system15": "Now let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user15": "I... I'm going to Beond in a few weeks for Ibogaine. My fourth medicine, but this one feels different. I keep chasing these experiences because I get glimpses\u2014of who I really am, of what actually matters\u2014but then I come home and it's like I'm wearing someone else's life again.\n\nI sold my company five years ago. Everyone thinks I should be celebrating that victory forever, but it's like... I built this incredible thing and then realized I'd been climbing the wrong mountain. Now I'm supposed to figure out what the right mountain even is, and I'm terrified I'll waste the rest of my life getting it wrong again.\n\nMy kids are growing up fast\u20149 and 12\u2014and I keep promising myself I'll be more present, but then I'm checking email during dinner or mentally rehearsing board meeting talking points while we're supposed to be hiking. I want them to remember their mom as someone who was actually *there*, not just physically present.\n\nAnd there's this spiritual hunger that's been gnawing at me since the ayahuasca three years ago. My grandmother's Jewish mysticism, those Friday night dinners with candlelight and ancient songs... I walked away from all of it to build empires, and now I can't shake the feeling that I traded gold for glitter.\n\nI guess I'm here because I'm tired of being successful at things that don't matter and failing at the things that do.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's spiritual wisdom\n3. Living what matters instead of just understanding it\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yes... those are exactly the three threads that keep showing up in my journal, in my 3am spirals, in every integration circle. They're connected somehow, aren't they? Like if I could just... live them instead of analyze them, everything else would fall into place.\n\nBut how do I turn \"stop being mentally elsewhere\" into something the medicine can actually work with? I've tried every productivity hack, every meditation app, every screen-time limiter. Nothing sticks longer than a week.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's spiritual wisdom in daily moments\n3. I live what actually matters, not what looks impressive\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "The first one hits like a gut punch\u2014\"I show up fully present when my kids need me.\" That's the one that makes my throat tight. But it feels... too vague? Like, what does \"fully present\" even mean when I'm used to being 80% everywhere?\n\nMaybe something more concrete? Like... \"I put my phone away when they walk in the room\" or \"I hear their questions the first time instead of saying 'mm-hmm' while scrolling.\" I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it.\n\nThe second one feels right but I want it stronger. \"Reclaim\" sounds passive, like I'm waiting for it to happen. My grandmother didn't wait for anything\u2014she *lived* her faith every damn day. What's the word for grabbing something with both hands instead of politely accepting it?\n\nThe third one... yeah. That's the core wound, isn't it? Living for applause instead of purpose.",
  "system18": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I put my phone down when my kids walk in the room\n2. I embrace my grandmother's spiritual wisdom every Friday\n3. I choose purpose over applause\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user18": "*eyes get a little watery*\n\nYeah. These... these I can feel in my chest, not just my head.\n\nThe phone one\u2014God, how many times have they caught me mid-scroll, that guilty snap of turning it face-down? But what if instead of shame, I just... stopped? What if when they walk in, they get all of me?\n\nFriday nights... that's when she used to light the candles. I could start there, couldn't I? Just one night a week where I'm not Ellen the investor, Ellen the board member\u2014just Ellen, her granddaughter, carrying something forward that matters more than any deal I ever did.\n\nAnd \"purpose over applause\"... that's the one that scares me most because I don't know who I am without the applause. But maybe that's exactly why it needs to be first.\n\nThese feel... possible. Like something I could actually do, not just dream about.",
  "system19": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I put my phone down when my kids walk in the room\n2. I embrace my grandmother's spiritual wisdom every Friday\n3. I choose purpose over applause\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "I... thank you. I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe for the first time, I'm actually ready to stop performing and start... becoming. Whatever that means."
