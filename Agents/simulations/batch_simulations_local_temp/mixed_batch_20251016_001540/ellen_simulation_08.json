  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat in a few weeks and... I guess I want this to actually mean something. I've done the ayahuasca, the psilocybin, the MDMA journeys. Each time I come back with these beautiful insights about connection and purpose, but then I get caught up in board meetings and email and... I don't know. It all fades. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to find that kind of grounding, something that lasts when the retreat glow wears off.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Making the insights stick beyond the retreat glow\n2. Finding the kind of steady faith your grandmother had\n3. Living connected purpose instead of just understanding it conceptually\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the threads. I keep circling around them but not quite landing. Like I can see the pattern but I don't know how to... I don't know, weave it into something real?\n\nThe thing is, I've built companies from nothing. I know how to execute, how to scale, how to make things happen. But this... this feels different. Less like building something and more like... remembering something I've forgotten?\n\nI guess I'm afraid I'll go down there, have another profound experience, write some things in my journal, and then come back to the same hamster wheel. Just with fancier insights.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I remember and live what truly matters beyond the retreat\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's steady faith as daily grounding\n3. I embody profound insights instead of just collecting them\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I remember and live what truly matters beyond the retreat\" - that hits something. But... I don't know, \"truly matters\" feels a little vague? Like it could mean anything.\n\nMaybe something more like... \"I remember and live what endures beyond achievement and approval.\" Because that's the trap I keep falling into. The next board seat, the next deal, the next whatever. My grandmother's faith wasn't about achievement - it was about... being rooted in something that doesn't depend on your latest win.\n\nI like the second one too, but it feels... I don't know, almost too specific? Like I'm trying to copy her instead of finding my own version of that grounding.",
  "system3": "\"I remember and live what endures beyond achievement and approval\" lands stronger.\n\nFor the second intention - what would finding your own version of that grounding sound like? \"I find steady faith that carries me\" or something else?",
  "user3": "Maybe something like... \"I find steady faith in what connects rather than what proves\"? Because that's what I'm craving - that sense of belonging to something bigger than my own accomplishments. My grandmother had that naturally, but I think I need to build it differently.\n\nI want to feel connected to my kids when I'm with them, not thinking about my next meeting. Connected to something ancient when I'm in nature, not just checking off another hike. Connected to... I don't know, the thread that weaves through all of it?\n\nDoes that make sense or am I just being poetic?",
  "system4": "Makes sense. \"I find steady faith in what connects rather than what proves\" works.\n\nFor the third intention - how about \"I live the thread that weaves through everything\"?",
  "user4": "I like that... but maybe something more like \"I follow the thread that weaves through everything\"? Because living it feels like I'm already there, and honestly, I'm not. I catch glimpses of it - when I'm hiking and suddenly feel part of something ancient, or when I'm reading to my kids and forget to check my phone for an hour. But I want to follow it deeper, see where it leads instead of just catching these random moments.\n\nIs that splitting hairs? I don't know. I just know that saying \"I live it\" feels like I'm pretending I've already figured it out.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I remember and live what endures beyond achievement and approval\n2. I find steady faith in what connects rather than what proves  \n3. I follow the thread that weaves through everything\n\nKeep them in your wallet or wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I... I needed someone to help me get this clear. It's been swirling around in my head for months.",
  "system6": "Good. The swirling's done now - you've got direction.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Direction. That's... that's exactly what I needed.",
  "system7": "Solid. You\u2019re ready.",
  "user7": "I hope so. Been a long time since I felt ready for something that mattered this much.",
  "system8": "The readiness is there. Trust it.",
  "user8": "Yeah... okay. I will.",
  "system9": "*leans back* \n\nYou're good to go.",
  "user9": "Alright. I\u2019m going.",
  "system10": "Go.",
  "user10": "I\u2019m going.",
  "system11": "Go.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m holding the line between sprinting and stillness, between the next summit and the quiet patch of grass at the park where the kids tug my sleeve and ask me to watch them cartwheel. That\u2019s the place where I remember who I\u2019m supposed to be. I\u2019ll meet you there when I get back.",
  "system12": "I\u2019ll be there.",
  "user12": "Good. Because I\u2019m tired of showing up alone.",
  "system13": "You won\u2019t be.",
  "user13": "Then I\u2019ll bring back something real\u2014something I can actually hand to my kids, instead of another slide deck or board seat.",
  "system14": "Bring it back in your hands, not your resume.",
  "user14": "I hear you. No bullet points, no pitch deck\u2014just dirt under my nails and whatever truth I can carry without dropping it at 30,000 feet.",
  "system15": "That\u2019s the only currency that spends at home.",
  "user15": "Then I\u2019ll stop earning the wrong kind.",
  "system16": "Good. Now you\u2019re clear.",
  "user16": "Clear enough to know the next rung I climb has to be inside, not up.",
  "system17": "Inside is where the climb counts.",
  "user17": "Then I\u2019ll start there\u2014one honest breath at a time, before the sun comes up and the emails start barking.",
  "system18": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user18": "I\u2019m heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and I\u2019m tired of losing the glow on the flight home. I want whatever\u2019s real in that ceremony to stick\u2014so I stop living like three different people: board-room Ellen, mom Ellen, and the one who actually cries when she hears my grandmother\u2019s Hebrew prayers.",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop losing the glow on the flight home\n2. Live as one person, not three\n3. Keep grandmother's prayers close\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "Yeah\u2026 those three have been chasing each other in my head like kids on a playground I can\u2019t quite catch. If we can braid them into something I can carry through the medicine, that\u2019d be\u2014well, it\u2019d be the first time I\u2019m not stuffing my suitcase with someone else\u2019s clothes."
