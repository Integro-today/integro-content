  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks, and... I don't know. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, the women's MDMA circles. Each time I think I've figured something out, and then I'm back here. Still searching.\n\nI keep chasing these experiences because I need to know if there's something more than just... building companies and making money. My grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything, and I feel like I've lost that somehow.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding something beyond building companies and making money\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's sense of the divine spark\n3. Discovering what actually sticks after the ceremonies end\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? I've been pulling at them for years now.\n\nI guess what I really want is to stop feeling like I'm performing my life instead of living it. Like there has to be something more authentic than just being the woman who sold her company and sits on boards now. But I don't even know what that looks like anymore.\n\nMy grandmother... she had this way of being present. Like she could see the sacred in washing dishes or walking to temple. I want that back, but I don't know how to get there from board meetings and investor calls.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm tired of the retreat high fading. Tired of coming home and watching myself slip back into the same patterns. The 5am emails, the constant striving.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live authentically instead of performing my life\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's presence in daily moments\n3. I embody what the medicine shows me beyond the retreat\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - living authentically instead of performing. That's... that's it. That's what keeps me up at night, wondering if anyone actually knows the real me or if I've just gotten really good at playing the part.\n\nBut \"authentically\" feels kind of... soft. I don't know. Maybe it's the business side of me, but I need something stronger. More concrete. Like I want to know what authentic actually *looks like* in my life, you know?\n\nThough maybe that's the point - I have to figure that out instead of having it all mapped out like some strategic plan.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I show up as my real self instead of playing the part\"\n\nOr: \"I drop the performance and live real\"\n\nPick what feels strong enough to hold.",
  "user3": "\"I drop the performance and live real.\" That one hits different. It's... I don't know, it feels like something I can actually remember when I'm reaching for my phone to check emails at 5:30am or when I'm nodding along in board meetings pretending to care about quarterly projections.\n\nIt's strong. Direct. No room for me to wiggle out of it or intellectualize what it means.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I drop the performance and live real\n\nHow do the other two land?\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's presence in daily moments\n3. I embody what the medicine shows me beyond the retreat",
  "user4": "The second one... \"I reclaim my grandmother's presence in daily moments.\" That's good, but it feels kind of... passive? Like I'm just waiting for her presence to show up instead of actively finding it.\n\nMaybe something like \"I find the divine spark in ordinary moments like my grandmother did\" or \"I see the sacred in daily life like my grandmother taught me.\" I want it to feel more active, like I'm doing something, not just hoping it comes back to me.\n\nThe third one about embodying what the medicine shows me - that one's solid. I've gotten really good at integration journaling and then... nothing. Like I'm collecting insights like trophies instead of actually living them.\n\nHow about \"I live what the medicine teaches me every day, not just in ceremony\"?",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I see the sacred in daily life like my grandmother taught me\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I live what the medicine teaches me every day, not just in ceremony\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I drop the performance and live real\n2. I see the sacred in daily life like my grandmother taught me  \n3. I live what the medicine teaches me every day, not just in ceremony\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I... I needed this. To get clear on what I'm actually looking for instead of just chasing the next experience.\n\nI'll keep them close. Maybe write them in the journal I never actually use, or put them in my phone where I can't avoid seeing them. \n\nI feel like I can breathe a little easier now. Like I know why I'm really going to Beond.",
  "system6": "Good. The clarity itself is medicine.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah... it is, isn't it? Just saying it out loud like this. Making it real instead of all these vague feelings bouncing around in my head.\n\nI think I've been afraid to get too specific, like if I named what I actually wanted, I'd have to actually do something about it. Can't hide behind \"I don't know what I'm looking for\" anymore.\n\nThanks for helping me get here.",
  "system7": "Exactly. Naming it gives you something to stand on.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "I am. I feel it - this steadiness I haven't had before. Like I'm not just floating from one retreat to the next hoping something sticks.\n\nThese three intentions... they're solid ground under my feet. Finally.",
  "system8": "That's it. You found your footing.\n\nNow walk it.",
  "user8": "I will. One step at a time, every day. Not perfectly, but real.",
  "system9": "That's all it takes.",
  "user9": "Yeah... just showing up. Every morning when that 5:30 alarm goes off, choosing real over performance. Choosing to see what's actually there instead of what I think should be there.\n\nI can do that. I finally know what \"that\" is.",
  "system10": "You've got it.",
  "user10": "I do. Thank you\u2014for helping me find what was already here.",
  "system11": "You did the finding. I just held the flashlight.",
  "user11": "Still counts. Sometimes you need someone else to hold the light so you can actually see what\u2019s in front of you.",
  "system12": "True enough.",
  "user12": "Yeah... I guess we're done here then. For now.",
  "system13": "For now.",
