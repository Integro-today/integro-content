  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I got into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks for this ayahuasca thing. I don't know what I'm supposed to say here - they said this might help me sleep better, stop waking up the whole house with... whatever's going on at night. Can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without whatever's happening\n2. Stop waking up the whole house\n3. Find a way to keep going\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that about sums it up. I guess... I need to stop pretending everything's fine when it's not. Amanda's scared of me sometimes - I hate that. Just want to be the man my kids think I am. Not whatever I've become since I got back.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and my family\n3. I become the man my kids believe I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. About Amanda and the family. That's what matters most - keeping them safe from... from whatever this is. I don't know about \"reclaim safety\" though. Sounds too... I don't know. Soft. Maybe just \"I protect my family from my demons\" or something. That's what I'm trying to do here.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I protect my family from my demons\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one - about sleeping peaceful - that'd be nice but it feels like... I don't know, asking for too much maybe. Like I don't deserve that. \n\nThe third one though... about being who my kids think I am. That's everything. They're 11 and 14, they still look at me like I'm some kind of hero. Don't want to lose that. Don't want them to see what's really underneath.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I find rest at night\n2. I protect my family from my demons  \n3. I stay worthy of my kids' trust\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user4": "Yeah. These work. I can work with these. \n\n\"Find rest\" - that's better. Not asking for miracles, just... rest. \n\nAnd staying worthy of their trust - that's it exactly. That's what I'm fighting for here.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I find rest at night\n2. I protect my family from my demons\n3. I stay worthy of my kids' trust\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years through three deployments and back. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I needed this.",
  "system6": "Good. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "Roger that. Three weeks to Rythmia. I'll be ready.",
  "system7": "Three weeks is solid time. Let the intentions do their work.\n\nSafe travels.",
  "user7": "Copy that. I'll see this through.",
