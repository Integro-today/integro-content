  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks, and... I guess I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done the ayahuasca, the psilocybin, the MDMA weekends\u2014they all showed me pieces of something, but I keep losing the thread when I get back home. \n\nI built this company, sold it, made more money than I'll ever need, but it feels like I traded away something important. My grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything, and I remember rolling my eyes at her mysticism. Now I think she knew something I don't.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Holding onto insights instead of losing them when you get home\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's sense of the divine\n3. Finding what you traded away for the money/success\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the three things that keep circling back. I get home from these beautiful retreats with all these insights written in my journal, and then it's like I'm underwater again. Meetings, kids' schedules, board obligations\u2014everything that felt so clear starts fading.\n\nMy grandmother, she used to light candles on Friday nights and somehow make our tiny apartment feel like a cathedral. I want that back, that sense that there's something bigger than quarterly earnings reports.\n\nAnd you're right\u2014there's something I gave up to become who I thought I needed to be. I was so busy proving myself, building something impressive, that I... I don't know. I lost the thread of why any of it mattered.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I integrate my insights into daily life instead of losing them\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's sense of the sacred in ordinary moments\n3. I recover what I traded away for external success\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me hardest\u2014I reclaim my grandmother's sense of the sacred in ordinary moments. That's what I'm actually hungry for. Not more achievements or insights I can't hold onto, but the ability to find that cathedral feeling in regular Tuesdays at home with my kids.\n\nThe third one... I want to adjust it. \"I recover what I traded away\" sounds too neat, like it's just sitting there waiting for me. What I really need is to forgive myself for making those trade-offs. I was doing the best I could with what I knew then.\n\nMaybe something like: I forgive myself for abandoning what mattered most, and I choose differently now.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim my grandmother's sense of the sacred in ordinary moments\n\nHow about: I forgive myself for abandoning what mattered, and I choose it now\n\nHow does that land with the other two?",
  "user3": "That feels... cleaner. More honest. I forgive myself for abandoning what mattered, and I choose it now.\n\nThe first one still feels too vague though\u2014\"I integrate my insights into daily life.\" It's like I'm trying to solve a business problem. What I really need is something more concrete. Something about actually showing up differently instead of just thinking about it differently.\n\nMaybe: I practice showing up present instead of performing, even when it's uncomfortable.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I practice showing up present instead of performing, even when it's uncomfortable\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's sense of the sacred in ordinary moments  \n3. I forgive myself for abandoning what mattered, and I choose it now\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll keep these close\u2014I need them where I can't forget them when the day gets loud.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the words - your body remembers the direction.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "That's... actually comforting. That maybe I don't have to hold onto everything so tightly, that something deeper than my busy mind already knows the way back.",
  "system6": "Exactly. Your system already knows the way home. \n\nThese intentions just help you notice when you're drifting.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Like a compass in my pocket\u2014I might still get lost, but at least I'll know which way is north.",
  "system7": "Precisely. \n\nYou've got what you need.",
  "user7": "I appreciate this. Really. Feels like... maybe I can stop trying to figure everything out and just let myself find the way.",
  "system8": "That's it. Stop figuring, start finding.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user8": "Ready. Yeah. I think I actually am.",
  "system9": "Go.",
  "user9": "*text sent*",
  "system10": "*nods*\n\nYou're set.",
  "user10": "Thank you. For walking me through this... for helping me see I already had what I needed. I'll carry these intentions with me.",
  "system11": "You carried them before we started. I just helped you name them.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user11": "I will. Deep down... I think I already do.",
  "system12": "Good.",
  "user12": "I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.",
  "system13": "Do that.",
  "user13": "I will. And I\u2019ll try to remember\u2014this isn\u2019t about fixing anything. It\u2019s about remembering what I already know.",
  "system14": "Exactly.",
  "user14": "Thank you.",
  "system15": "You're welcome.",
  "user15": "I\u2019ll head into this with what we named. And I\u2019ll carry the thread back when I return.",
  "system16": "I'll be here.",
  "user16": "That means more than you know.",
  "system17": "I hear you.",
  "user17": "I believe you do.",
  "system18": "Good.",
  "user18": "Then I\u2019m ready.",
  "system19": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
  "user19": "I will."
