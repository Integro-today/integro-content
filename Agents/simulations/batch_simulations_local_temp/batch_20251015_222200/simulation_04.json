  "system0": "Look, I don't know how this is supposed to work, but Heroic Hearts says I need to set these intentions before I head down to Costa Rica. I just need to figure out how to stop waking up Amanda with my screaming and keep this family together.",
  "user0": "I hear you - the nightmares are taking a toll on both of you, and you're fighting to hold everything together. That's a heavy burden to carry alone.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. For your ayahuasca experience, intentions can help guide the healing process, especially around trauma and relationships. They're not rigid goals, more like gentle directions that allow space for unexpected insights.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what needs healing around the trauma and how to reconnect with Amanda. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works and examples from other veterans first.\n\nWhich would you like to explore?",
  "system1": "I don't know about all this \"gentle direction\" stuff. I need this to work - that's why I'm going down there in the first place. \n\nBut fine, Option A. I guess we need to figure out what the hell I'm supposed to say to some plant that's gonna supposedly fix my head. How do we even start with this?",
  "user1": "I get it - when you're desperate for something to work, all this talk about \"gentle directions\" can sound like spiritual fluff. But here's the thing: the medicine does the heavy lifting. Your job is just to show up with clarity about what needs healing.\n\nLet's get straight to it. What happens in those nightmares that has you waking up screaming? Give me the raw version - no need to pretty it up.",
  "system2": "I... it's always the same damn thing. I'm back in the cockpit and Johnson's on my wing - he's calling out missile lock and I'm telling him to break right but he doesn't hear me or something and then there's this flash and he's just... gone. And I wake up with Amanda grabbing my shoulders because I'm yelling his name like I can still save him.\n\nBut it's not just the one time. It's every time I couldn't protect someone. They all just... they keep dying and I keep failing them.",
  "user2": "That's brutal - reliving every moment you couldn't save them, like your mind's forcing you to watch a highlight reel of your worst failures. No wonder you're yelling - you're still trying to save Johnson, still trying to protect your people.\n\nTell me about Amanda in all this. When she's grabbing your shoulders at 3 AM, what's that doing to her? To the two of you together?",
  "system3": "She's... she's scared. Jumped out of bed one night when I was shouting about incoming and knocked over the nightstand. Now she sleeps facing away from me mostly, like she's bracing for it. \n\nShe says she doesn't know who she's gonna wake up next to - me or whatever's coming out of me in those dreams. And I can't... I can't explain it to her. What do I say? That I'm still fighting a war that ended years ago? That I'm watching my friends die every night?\n\nShe married a pilot, not this... this mess.",
  "user3": "So now you're losing her too - not to death, but to this thing that takes you over at night. And you can't explain it because how do you explain carrying a war in your head that won't end?\n\nWhat about the day-to-day? When you're not having nightmares, how's the connection between you two? Are you still talking, touching, laughing - or has this poisoned everything?",
  "system4": "We talk about the kids' school stuff, the mortgage, what needs fixing around the house. Functional shit. But she'll reach for my hand sometimes and I'll flinch without meaning to - too busy scanning the restaurant for exits or watching some guy's hands across the room. \n\nHaven't... it's been months since we were really together. She tries and I make excuses about being tired or having to get up early. Truth is, I don't want her seeing me like that - what if I have one of those dreams while she's right there?\n\nShe says I'm disappearing on her even when I'm in the same room.",
  "user4": "You're physically present but emotionally checked out - scanning for threats instead of connecting with her. And the more you pull away to protect her from seeing the mess, the more you're actually losing her.\n\nLet me ask you something hard: When you imagine coming back from Costa Rica, what would \"fixed\" actually look like? Not just the nightmares stopping - what does being with Amanda feel like when you're not at war anymore?",
  "system5": "I don't know... I guess... maybe I could sit on the couch without feeling like I need to be ready for something to explode. Maybe when she touches my shoulder I wouldn't jump like she's got a knife. \n\nMaybe I could look at her without thinking about how I'm gonna screw this up. Maybe we could just... be quiet together again. Like before. When quiet wasn't dangerous.\n\nI want to be the guy who could protect his country AND protect his marriage. Not this... this broken thing that can't even sleep right.",
  "user5": "You want to be able to protect what matters - both then and now. Not broken, just stuck in a loop where your survival instincts won't shut off.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads:\n\n1. Finding peace with the friends you couldn't save - releasing the guilt that keeps them dying in your dreams\n2. Reclaiming safety in your own body and home - so touch doesn't feel like threat and quiet doesn't feel like danger\n3. Reconnecting with Amanda as someone worthy of love, not just someone who needs fixing\n\nDoes that capture what matters most?",
  "system6": "Yeah... yeah, that's it. I don't want to keep watching them die every night. And I want to come home and not feel like I'm walking into enemy territory in my own house. \n\nAnd Amanda... I want her to feel safe with me again. Not like she's living with some loaded weapon that might go off.\n\nI just don't know how to get there from here.",
  "user6": "Based on those threads, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. \"I open myself to releasing the guilt I carry for those I couldn't save, allowing their memory to rest in peace\"\n\n2. \"I embrace feeling safe and grounded in my body and home, where touch and quiet can be sources of comfort rather than threat\"\n\n3. \"I reclaim my capacity to be present and emotionally available, becoming someone Amanda can feel safe with again\"\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? The medicine can help you process what your mind keeps replaying, but these intentions will guide it toward what you need most.",
  "system7": "The second one... that one hits me. \"Safe and grounded in my body and home.\" Yeah. That's what I need. I'm tired of feeling like I'm behind enemy lines in my own bedroom.\n\nBut I don't know about the first one - \"releasing guilt.\" That sounds like... like letting them go. Like forgetting them. I can't do that to my guys.",
  "user7": "I hear you - letting go sounds like abandoning them all over again. What if we shifted it to honor rather than release?\n\nHow about: \"I open myself to honoring their memory without carrying the weight of their deaths\"?\n\nThat way you're not forgetting them - you're finding a different way to carry them with you. One that doesn't destroy you every night.",
  "system8": "Yeah... I could live with that. Honor them without... without it killing me too. They're gone but they don't have to keep dragging me down with them.\n\nAnd the third one - about being present for Amanda. That's important. But I need to get right in my own head first before I can be right for her.",
  "user8": "Exactly - you can't be present for her when you're still fighting battles in your head every night. The third intention needs to be about your healing first.\n\nHow about: \"I reclaim my capacity to be fully present, healing myself so I can show up whole for Amanda and our life together\"?\n\nThat puts your healing first, but keeps the connection to what comes after. You getting right with yourself IS how you get right with her.",
  "system9": "Yeah. That's better. I can't fix anything with her if I'm still broken inside.\n\nSo... honor the guys without drowning in it. Get grounded in my own skin again. And heal myself so I can be the man she married, not this... ghost that's taken over my body.\n\nThese feel... possible. Not easy, but possible.",
  "user9": "You've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card with your dog tags - something that's been with you through everything\n- Keep them in your wallet where you'll see them daily\n- Read them each morning while you check your gear (if you still do that ritual)\n- Record yourself reading them and listen when the nightmares come\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when things get hard?",
  "system10": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nAnd yeah... I still check my gear every morning. Old habit. Maybe I'll read 'em then. When I'm still half-asleep, before the day starts trying to kick my ass.",
  "user10": "That feels right - using a ritual you already have. When you're still half-asleep, before the world starts demanding things from you.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I open myself to honoring their memory without carrying the weight of their deaths\"\n\n2. \"I embrace feeling safe and grounded in my body and home\"\n\n3. \"I reclaim my capacity to be fully present, healing myself so I can show up whole for Amanda and our life together\"\n\nYour chosen ritual: Write them down, keep in your wallet, read them each morning while checking your gear\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nThis work takes guts. You're facing what most people spend their lives running from. Wishing you strength on this journey, soldier.",
  "system11": "Copy that. I'll hold these close and see where this thing takes me.\n\nThanks for helping me get my head straight about this. Three weeks to Rythmia... feels like forever and no time at all.",
  "user11": "Three weeks gives you time to sit with these, let them settle in. No need to overthink it now - you've got your compass. \n\nWhen you're down there and things get intense (and they probably will), just come back to these three things. The medicine knows what to do with them.\n\nSafe travels, brother. You've got this.",
  "system12": "Roger that. Appreciate the help getting this sorted.",
  "user12": "Anytime. Take care of yourself down there.",
  "system13": "Copy that.",
  "user13": "\u2713 Intentions complete and ritual set. You're ready for this journey. Hold these close, trust the process, and come back whole.",
  "system14": "Copy that. See you on the other side.",
  "user14": "See you on the other side, brother. Come back safe.",
  "system15": "Always do.",
  "user15": "That's the spirit. Travel well.",
  "system16": "Appreciate it.",
  "user16": "You got it. Safe travels.",
  "system17": "Copy that.",
  "user17": "Copy that.",
  "system18": "Roger that.",
  "user18": "Roger that\u2014out.",
