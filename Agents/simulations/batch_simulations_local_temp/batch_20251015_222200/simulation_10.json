  "system0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with my nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up Amanda like this\u2014she deserves better than what I'm giving her.",
  "user0": "I hear the weight you're carrying - not just the nightmares themselves, but how they're impacting someone you love. That kind of awareness shows real care, even when you feel like you're failing.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. For plant medicine work, intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance. They're different from goals because they allow space for surprises and unexpected healing.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're hoping to heal or understand about these nightmares and your relationship with Amanda. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\nOption B: I can share more about how intention-setting works with trauma-related issues and examples from other veterans first.\n\nWhich feels better to start with?",
  "system1": "I... I don't know. I guess option A. \n\nI mean, I already told you what I want\u2014to stop these damn dreams from waking her up. And maybe figure out why I'm still seeing those missions every night when I'm supposed to be home safe. That's it.",
  "user1": "Those missions following you home - that's a heavy burden to carry, especially when it's stealing peace from both of you. \n\nLet me ask - when you say \"those missions,\" what are the dreams actually showing you? Are you back in the same places, or is it more the feelings that come flooding back?",
  "system2": "It's... it's always the same one. Third tour. We're escorting a convoy and the lead vehicle hits an IED. I'm watching through my windshield as everything just... stops making sense. The radio's screaming and I'm trying to get my bird airborne but the controls feel like they're underwater.\n\nSometimes it's different after that. Sometimes I see Jenkins burning and I can't get to him. Sometimes I'm back home but I hear the explosion and I know it's coming for Amanda and the kids. Sometimes I'm just falling through black nothing, knowing I screwed up and people died because I wasn't fast enough, wasn't good enough.",
  "user2": "That's brutal - reliving that moment where everything changed, where being fast enough wasn't humanly possible. The way it's bleeding into your home life, making you feel like the danger's coming for Amanda and the kids... that's a special kind of torture.\n\nWhen you wake up from these dreams, what does Amanda usually see? What's happening to you in those moments?",
  "system3": "She sees me sitting straight up, drenched in sweat, sometimes I'm shouting coordinates or calling out names. Sometimes I don't remember what I said, but she tells me I look like I'm ready to fight someone. My heart's pounding like I just ran ten miles.\n\nLast month she tried to touch my shoulder and I grabbed her wrist before I knew what I was doing. Didn't hurt her but... the look on her face. Like she didn't know who I was for a second. That's when she started sleeping in the guest room some nights. Says she worries about waking me up.\n\nI hate that she has to walk on eggshells in her own house. This isn't what she signed up for.",
  "user3": "That moment when she didn't recognize you - that's got to be terrifying for both of you. And now she's the one protecting you by sleeping alone, when you probably both need the comfort. \n\nWhat do you think these dreams are trying to tell you? Not the surface story, but underneath - what part of you is still back there on that road, still trying to get it right?",
  "system4": "I... I don't know. Maybe it's the part that knows I should've seen it coming. Should've flown lower, spotted the pressure plate, something. Jenkins had three kids and a wife who sent him care packages every week. I got to come home to Amanda and build this life, and he... \n\nMaybe it's punishment. For surviving when better men didn't. For building this whole damn life on top of what happened over there. Like if I let myself really sleep, really relax, I'm betraying them somehow.",
  "user4": "That survivor's guilt is eating you alive - like enjoying your life means you're forgetting them or saying their lives mattered less. But you're carrying a weight that was never yours to carry. Jenkins' death wasn't your failure, yet you're doing penance every night.\n\nWhat would it mean to actually come home? Not just physically, but to really be here with Amanda, to let yourself have this life you built?",
  "system5": "I... I can't even imagine that. Really being here, not jumping at every loud noise, not scanning the room when I walk into restaurants, not feeling like I need to be ready for something bad to happen. \n\nIt's like I'm two different people. The guy who runs the insurance business and coaches Little League, and then this... other guy who still thinks he's supposed to keep everyone safe from threats that don't exist here. If I let go of that second guy, who even am I? What am I supposed to do with all that... readiness? All that training?\n\nAnd if I stop being that guy, does it mean Jenkins died for nothing? That none of it mattered?",
  "user5": "You're stuck between these two versions of yourself - the protector who's still on mission and the civilian who just wants to coach Little League and sleep through the night. That's a brutal split to live with.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding peace with what happened on that road - releasing the guilt that keeps you chained to that moment\n2. Reconnecting with the part of you that can be present with Amanda and the kids, not just physically here but emotionally available\n3. Making meaning from what you carry - honoring Jenkins and the others without staying trapped in that night\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system6": "Yeah... yeah, that's about right. I need to figure out how to let go of that night without feeling like I'm abandoning them. And I need to be able to sleep next to my wife without scaring the hell out of her.\n\nHow do we turn this into... whatever these intention things are supposed to be?",
  "user6": "Based on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to releasing the guilt that chains me to that road, allowing peace for myself and honor for those I lost\n2. I reclaim my ability to be fully present and safe with Amanda, creating space for intimacy instead of isolation\n3. I welcome understanding of how to carry their memory forward while building the life I fought to protect\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system7": "The second one. That one hits me hardest - about being safe for Amanda instead of making her feel like she's sleeping next to a loaded weapon. \n\nBut I need to say it my way. Not all that... soft language. Something like: \"I want to figure out how to sleep through the night without hurting the people I'm supposed to protect.\"",
  "user7": "I hear you - you need words that feel like they come from your mouth, not a therapy office. \n\nBut I want to suggest a small shift: instead of \"without hurting,\" which focuses on what you don't want to do, what about something like: \"I want to figure out how to sleep through the night so Amanda feels safe lying next to me again.\"\n\nSame strength, but pointing toward what you're building instead of what you're afraid of. How does that land?",
  "system8": "Yeah... that's better. \"I want to figure out how to sleep through the night so Amanda feels safe lying next to me again.\" That's what I want. \n\nWhat about the other stuff? About Jenkins and that whole mess? I don't want to forget him, but I can't keep doing this every night.",
  "user8": "For the Jenkins piece - you're not trying to forget him, right? You're trying to carry him differently. Not like a weight that crushes you every night, but like... something you can actually honor.\n\nWhat about: \"I want to find a way to honor Jenkins and the others without staying trapped in that moment with them.\"\n\nKeeps the mission focus you need, but moves it toward something possible.",
  "system9": "Yeah. \"I want to find a way to honor Jenkins and the others without staying trapped in that moment with them.\" That's... that's what I need. \n\nI can live with those two. They're mine, not someone trying to make me sound like someone I'm not.",
  "user9": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I want to figure out how to sleep through the night so Amanda feels safe lying next to me again.\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I want to find a way to honor Jenkins and the others without staying trapped in that moment with them.\"\n\nYou mentioned three main threads though - we've got honoring your guys and being present with Amanda. What about the third one - making meaning from what you carry, using all that training and readiness for something that serves your life now?",
  "system10": "That one's trickier. I don't know what to do with all this... vigilance. All this training to spot threats, to be ready for the worst. It's like having a guard dog that never stops barking, but the only thing it's protecting me from now is my own life.\n\nMaybe something like: \"I want to figure out how to use what I learned over there to actually protect what's important here, instead of just jumping at shadows.\"",
  "user10": "That works - taking all that training and readiness and pointing it toward something that actually serves your life now, not just keeps you on high alert for threats that aren't there.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I want to figure out how to use what I learned over there to actually protect what's important here, instead of just jumping at shadows.\"\n\nYour three intentions:\n1. \"I want to find a way to honor Jenkins and the others without staying trapped in that moment with them.\"\n2. \"I want to figure out how to sleep through the night so Amanda feels safe lying next to me again.\"\n3. \"I want to figure out how to use what I learned over there to actually protect what's important here, instead of just jumping at shadows.\"\n\nHow do you want to keep these close during your journey?",
  "system11": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "user11": "Perfect - your wallet's already something you reach for daily, something that's traveled with you through all this. These intentions will be right there with everything else you've carried.\n\nYour intentions:\n1. \"I want to find a way to honor Jenkins and the others without staying trapped in that moment with them.\"\n2. \"I want to figure out how to sleep through the night so Amanda feels safe lying next to me again.\"\n3. \"I want to figure out how to use what I learned over there to actually protect what's important here, instead of just jumping at shadows.\"\n\nYour ritual: Keep them written in your wallet where you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass - they'll guide what needs to emerge, but they won't force it. The medicine will show you what you're ready to see. You've done the hard work of naming what matters. Now you just need to show up and let it unfold.\n\nWishing you strength on this journey, and some peace for you and Amanda.",
  "system12": "Thanks. Three weeks until I head down there. Keep thinking maybe I should back out - this whole plant medicine thing sounds... but I can't. Not if I want to keep her. Not if I want to be the man my kids think I am.\n\nAppreciate you helping me get this straight.",
  "user12": "Three weeks can feel like forever when you're carrying what you're carrying. But you've got something solid to hold onto now - three intentions that came from your own gut, not someone else's words.\n\nBacking out would be the easy thing. Showing up takes something else entirely. Your kids don't need perfect - they need you, working to come home to yourself.\n\nSafe travels to you.",
  "system13": "Yeah. Appreciate it.",
  "user13": "You're welcome. Travel well.",
  "system14": "Copy that.",
  "user14": "Roger that.",
  "system15": "*smiles despite himself* Roger that.",
  "user15": "*quiet smile back*",
  "system16": "You take care too.",
  "user16": "Will do.",
  "system17": "Copy.",
