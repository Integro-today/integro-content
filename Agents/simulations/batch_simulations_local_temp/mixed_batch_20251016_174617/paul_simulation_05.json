  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, how I snap at Amanda, how I can't sleep through the night without waking up drenched. I can't keep going like this.\n\nI guess... I need to figure out how to shut it off. Whatever's eating at me. Without becoming someone I don't recognize.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares or waking drenched\n2. Stop snapping at Amanda and damaging what matters\n3. Face what's eating at you without losing yourself\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That's... that's about right.\n\nI need to sleep like a normal person. Wake up without shouting, without Amanda looking at me like I'm some kind of stranger. She's been sleeping in the guest room more nights than not. Says she worries about waking me, but I know it's because she's scared of what I might do when I'm not really awake.\n\nAnd the snapping... I hate that about myself. She'll ask something simple, like if I want coffee, and I just... explode. Over nothing. My kids walk around me like I'm made of glass. That's not who I want to be.\n\nBut I don't want to lose who I am either. I've been strong my whole life. Did what I had to do. I just need to figure out how to carry it without it crushing everything else.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night and wake without shouting\n2. I respond to Amanda and my kids with steadiness instead of snapping\n3. I carry my strength without letting it crush what matters\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That one hits me hardest - \"respond to Amanda and my kids with steadiness instead of snapping.\" That's what I need most. I can feel it in my chest when you say it.\n\nBut... I don't know. \"Peacefully through the night\" sounds too soft. I'm not looking for peaceful. I'm looking for not waking up with my heart pounding, not scaring my family. Maybe something more like... \"I sleep through the night without the dreams pulling me under.\"\n\nAnd the third one... I need to carry what I did, who I became over there, without it poisoning everything here. Without making my home feel like a battlefield.\n\nHow about:\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams pulling me under\n2. I respond to Amanda and my kids with steadiness instead of snapping  \n3. I carry my service without letting it poison my home",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams pulling me under\n2. I respond to Amanda and my kids with steadiness instead of snapping\n3. I carry my service without letting it poison my home\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Alright. They're in my wallet now too - wrote them down on the back of an old business card. Been carrying that thing for years, figured it was about time it carried something that matters.\n\nThanks. I... I don't know what to expect over there, but at least I know what I'm aiming for now.",
  "system4": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're in you now.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user4": "Yeah. We'll see. I'm not good at trusting much of anything these days, but... I guess it's time to try something different.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll find out if this plant stuff is worth anything, or if I've just been fooling myself.",
  "system5": "Three weeks. The intentions will be waiting for you when you need them.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Alright. I'm counting on that.",
  "system6": "Count on yourself. The intentions just point to what's already there.",
  "user6": "I hear you. Just... been a long time since I trusted anything that was already inside me. We'll see if there's anything worth finding in there.",
  "system7": "It's there. The medicine will show you.",
  "user7": "Then I guess it's time to stop running from whatever's been chasing me in those dreams.",
  "system8": "Sounds about right.",
  "user8": "Alright. Let's do this.",
  "system9": "You're set.",
  "user9": "Copy that.",
  "system10": "See you on the other side.",

  "user14": "Look, I don't really know how to do this. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help me stop waking up screaming every night. Amanda's at her wit's end. I just... I need to figure out how to shut it off without losing who I am.",
  "system15": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without screaming\n2. Keep your sense of self while healing\n3. Bring peace back to your relationship with Amanda\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user15": "Yeah. That about sums it up. I just... I can't keep waking up like that. Scares the hell out of her. And I need to fix it without becoming someone else. Someone weak.",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I heal what's causing this without losing my strength\n3. I make home safe for Amanda and myself\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user16": "The second one's not quite right. I don't need to heal anything\u2014just need to get control of it. Maybe... \"I face what needs facing without breaking.\" Something like that. And the first one... I don't know. Feels too soft. \"I sleep without the dreams taking me down.\"",
  "system17": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I face what needs facing without breaking\n\nHow about:\n1. I sleep without the dreams taking me down\n2. I face what needs facing without breaking\n3. I make home safe for Amanda and myself\n\nHow does the first one land now?",
  "user17": "Yeah. That works. It's not about being soft\u2014it's about not letting the dreams win anymore.",
  "system18": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep without the dreams taking me down\n2. I face what needs facing without breaking\n3.

  "user18": "Good. Now I just need to figure out how to not lose my mind in some jungle hut while this plant does whatever it does. Three weeks.",
  "system19": "Three weeks is solid time to prepare. The medicine works even when you're skeptical - you don't need to believe in it, just show up.\n\nFocus on what you can control: your breathing, staying grounded in your body, remembering why you're there. The intentions you set will anchor you when things feel wild.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "user19": "I'm not worried about being skeptical. I'm worried about what happens if this doesn't work. If I can't fix this... if I lose Amanda... I don't know what I'll do."
