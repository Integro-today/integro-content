  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I'm doing an iboga retreat in a few weeks and... I guess I'm supposed to figure out what I'm looking for. \n\nI've done this before - ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA - and each time I come back with these beautiful insights about connection and meaning. But then I get home and within weeks I'm back to the same patterns. Wake up at 5:30, check emails, board meetings, kids' schedules... It's like I never left.\n\nI need this one to stick. I can't keep chasing spiritual experiences and then going back to building businesses that don't really matter.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Making insights stick instead of losing them in daily chaos\n2. Living meaningfully beyond business success\n3. Being present for what actually matters\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's exactly it. I keep having these profound experiences where I see what's real - my kids laughing at the park, the way sunlight hits the trees, this sense that I'm part of something bigger. Then I'm back to checking my phone during dinner and scheduling every minute like that's what matters.\n\nI don't want to lose it this time. My grandmother had this quiet faith that carried her through everything - she prayed every morning, helped at the synagogue, knew everyone's name. I want to find my version of that. Not just believe in something during ceremony, but live it every day.\n\nAnd I need to figure out what I'm actually supposed to be doing with whatever time I have left. Not another company to sell or board to join - something that matters. Something that would make my kids proud in a way that has nothing to do with money.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I integrate ceremony wisdom into daily life\n2. I live from quiet faith that grounds me like my grandmother\n3. I use my gifts for what truly matters\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about my grandmother's quiet faith - that hits something deep. But I'd want to say it differently. \n\nShe didn't just have faith, she *was* faith. Never preached, never performed spirituality. Just... moved through the world with this steady presence. I want that. Not to copy her exactly, but to find my own version of it.\n\nMaybe something like: \"I live from the same steady presence that carried my grandmother through everything, rooted in something bigger than achievement.\"\n\nThe integration one feels real too. I keep thinking about how I meditate sometimes but inconsistently, how I journal after retreats but stop after a week. I want to actually live what I learn this time.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I live from the same steady presence that carried my grandmother through everything, rooted in something bigger than achievement\"\n\nHow about: \"I practice what I learn daily\" for the integration one - direct, simple, something you can check each day?\n\nAnd for intention 3 - what truly matters beyond achievement?",
  "user3": "\"I practice what I learn daily\" - yeah, that works. Simple, no room to wiggle out of it. I like that it doesn't specify how - keeps me from overthinking whether I'm doing it \"right.\"\n\nWhat truly matters... my kids are getting older. Nine and twelve. In a few years they'll be gone and I don't want to look back and realize I was physically there but mentally somewhere else. I want them to remember me being present, not perfect.\n\nAnd I keep thinking about my skills - building things, connecting people, seeing opportunities. I've been using them to make money. What if I used them to help people connect with something meaningful? Build spaces where people can find their own version of what my grandmother had?\n\nMaybe: \"I use my gifts to create spaces where people can find what matters beyond success.\"",

I live from the same steady presence that carried my grandmother through everything, rooted in something bigger than achievement\n3.

You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll keep these close. \n\nI think about keeping them in my wallet - where I used to keep business cards from people I thought I needed to impress. Seems right to replace those with something real.",
  "system5": "That's solid. Replacing the old signals with new ones.\n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what shows up.",
  "user5": "I hope so. I've been trying to control everything for so long... maybe it's time to see what happens when I stop gripping so tight.",
  "system6": "Loosen your grip in one small place and notice what changes. \n\nThe rest will follow.",
  "user6": "Tomorrow morning when I make coffee at 5:30, I'll leave my phone in the bedroom. Just... make coffee. Watch it brew. One small thing I can actually let go of.",
  "system7": "That's a real start. \n\n5:30 tomorrow, just you and the coffee. See what shows up when there's nothing to scroll.",
  "user7": "Yeah. Just me and the quiet kitchen before everyone wakes up. Haven't done that in... I don't even know how long.",
  "system8": "The quiet will remember you.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user8": "Thank you. For sitting with me through all this... uncertainty. I needed someone to help me find the words for what I've been chasing.",
  "system9": "You found your own words. I just held up the mirror.\n\nTrust what comes tomorrow.",
