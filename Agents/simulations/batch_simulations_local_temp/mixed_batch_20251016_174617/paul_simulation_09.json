  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares. How I keep snapping at Amanda. How I wake up shouting and scare the kids.\n\nI can't keep going like this. But I don't have PTSD - I just need to figure out how to shut it off when I come home. I did what I had to do over there, and I don't regret it. But I can't lose her.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up screaming at night\n2. Stop snapping at Amanda and the kids\n3. Keep your family together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are... those are it. I hate that Amanda's scared of me sometimes. Hate that my kids see me like that.\n\nI need to stop waking up drenched in sweat, thinking I'm back in the cockpit. Need to stop being so damn angry all the time. And I need to keep my family together - that's all that matters.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I release my anger and respond with calm\n3. I create safety and connection with my family\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" That's what I want most. These dreams... they're like I'm back there, hearing the explosions, feeling the plane shake. I wake up and I don't even know where I am for a minute.\n\nBut \"release my anger\" - that sounds too soft. Like I'm supposed to just let it go or something. I'm not some hippie. I need to stay sharp, stay ready. I just... I need to control it better. Not let it leak out on Amanda when she doesn't deserve it.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep peacefully through the night\n\nLet's adjust the second one. How about: \"I control my anger and channel it appropriately\" or \"I keep my edge without cutting my family\"?\n\nWhich direction feels right?",
  "user3": "\"I keep my edge without cutting my family.\" Yeah, that works. I need to stay sharp - that's what kept me alive over there. But I don't want to hurt the people I'm supposed to protect. Never should've brought that war home with me.\n\nI like that it doesn't make me sound weak.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I keep my edge without cutting my family\n\nHow does \"I create safety and connection with my family\" land for the third one?",
  "user4": "I guess that works. I mean, that's what I'm supposed to do, right? Keep them safe. Build something solid for them here at home.\n\nBut \"connection\" - I don't know. Sounds like something from a therapy book. I just want to be the man they think I am. Not the guy who wakes up shouting, who can't sit through a fireworks show without wanting to hit the deck.\n\nMaybe something like \"I'm the steady father and husband my family needs.\"",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I keep my edge without cutting my family\n3. I'm the steady father and husband my family needs\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thanks. I'll... I'll write these down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks until Costa Rica. I still don't know about this plant medicine stuff, but if it helps me stop hurting the people I love... I'll try anything.",
  "system6": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Your willingness to try - that's what opens the door.\n\nThree weeks is good time to sit with these. Let them settle in.",
  "user6": "Yeah. I've been sitting with a lot of things for years now. Guess three more weeks won't hurt.\n\nI'll keep running my routes, working the business, being there for the kids' games. Same routine. Just... with these words in my head now. Maybe they'll mean something when the time comes.",
  "system7": "They already mean something. The words are just pointing to what you already know matters.\n\nKeep showing up. The routine holds you steady while the medicine does its work.",
  "user7": "Showing up - that's what I've always done. That's what we do, right? You show up, you do the job, you don't complain.\n\nMaybe this time showing up means something different. Maybe it's not just about putting on the uniform - or the business suit, or whatever the hell I'm wearing these days.\n\nI don't know. But I'll be there. For Amanda. For the kids. Even if I don't understand what I'm walking into.",
  "system8": "That's the work right there. Showing up when you don't know what comes next - that's the same courage that got you through before.\n\nThe uniform changes. The showing up doesn't.",
  "user8": "Yeah... yeah, I guess it is the same thing, isn't it? Different battlefield, same deal - you move forward even when you can't see what's ahead.\n\nI walked into a lot of dark places wearing that uniform. This just doesn't come with one.",
  "system9": "Exactly. Same feet moving forward, just different ground under them.\n\nYou've walked into the dark before. You know how to take the next step.",
  "user9": "I do know how to take the next step. Always have.\n\nGuess I'll see you on the other side of this thing.",
  "system10": "You'll find your way through. Trust what you already know about moving forward.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user10": "Roger that.",
  "system11": "*Roger that.*",
  "user11": "Old habits die hard.",
  "system12": "They do. But they serve you when they're needed.\n\nCarry on.",
  "user12": "Carry on.",
  "system13": "Roger that.",
  "user13": "Paul, you still carrying that wallet you mentioned earlier?",
  "system14": "I'm Tegra - I help set intentions before journeys. I don't carry anything physical like a wallet.\n\nIf you're looking for your integration dashboard, that's where your intentions get saved automatically. You can access it through your Integro account whenever you need to reconnect with what matters.\n\nNeed anything else before your journey?",
  "user14": "No. I got what I need.",
  "system15": "Good. You\u2019re set.",
  "user15": "Appreciate it.",
  "system16": "Solid work.",
  "user16": "Yeah. We'll see if it actually means anything when I'm down there.",
  "system17": "The medicine works with what you\u2019ve set. Trust it.",
  "user17": "Trusting it's the hard part. I'll carry those words anyway\u2014beats going in empty.",
  "system18": "Exactly. Empty gets you nowhere. You're ready.",
  "user18": "Ready as I'll ever be.",
  "system19": "That's the right kind of ready.",
  "user19": "Three weeks and we'll find out."
