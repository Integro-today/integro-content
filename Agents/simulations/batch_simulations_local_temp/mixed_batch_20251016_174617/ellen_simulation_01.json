  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I'm trying to figure out what actually matters now. I've spent my whole life chasing the next milestone, and I got everything I thought I wanted. But sitting here, getting ready for this Ibogaine journey, I keep thinking about my grandmother. She had this quiet faith, this way of moving through the world that wasn't about achievements or external validation.\n\nI want to understand what I lost when I left that behind. And I want to know how to be present with my kids\u2014really present, not just physically there while my mind's running through emails. \n\nThere's something else too... I keep feeling like I'm meant to do something meaningful with all these resources and connections I've built. But I'm terrified of jumping into another venture just because I'm good at building companies. I want whatever comes next to actually matter.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reconnecting with the grounded faith and wisdom your grandmother carried\n2. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n3. Using your resources for something that actually matters, not just what's next\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the three things that keep surfacing. Especially the grandmother piece\u2014I hadn't realized how much I miss that part of my heritage until these ceremonies started cracking me open. She used to light candles on Friday nights and hum these old melodies. I was always too busy with homework or sports to pay attention.\n\nAnd the kids... God, my daughter asked me yesterday what her favorite color was and I couldn't answer. I mean, how do you not know that about your own child? I'm there at the park, but I'm checking Slack. I'm helping with homework, but I'm thinking about board meetings.\n\nAs for the resources thing... I've got capital, I've got a network, I've got skills. But I'm paralyzed. What if I choose wrong? What if I build something that looks good on paper but doesn't actually move the needle for anyone?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith my grandmother carried\n2. I show up fully present when my kids reach for me\n3. I build what actually matters, not just what I'm good at building\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hard\u2014\"I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith my grandmother carried.\" That word \"reclaim\" feels right. Like it's still mine to come back to, not something I have to manufacture.\n\nThe second one... can we say \"I recognize when my kids reach for me and meet them with my full attention\"? It's more specific to what actually happens. They're always reaching\u2014asking me to watch them on the monkey bars, telling me about their day. I need to notice it in the moment, not just promise to be present generally.\n\nThe third one... I want to say \"I build what serves humanity, not just what serves my ego.\" Because I'm good at a lot of things, but being good at something doesn't mean it's what I should be doing. Does that work?",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith my grandmother carried\n2. I recognize when my kids reach for me and meet them with my full attention\n3. I build what serves humanity, not just what serves my ego\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Thank you. Having these written down... it feels different than when they're just bouncing around in my head. More real somehow.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother would probably laugh at all this\u2014me needing a ceremony to remember what she lived every day without thinking about it. But maybe that's the point. Maybe the ceremony helps me remember what she never forgot.",
  "system4": "She'd probably smile knowing you're finding your way back to what she carried so naturally. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they sink deeper than memory.\n\nTrust what's already moving in you.",
  "user4": "That's what I'm hoping for. That maybe this Ibogaine will help me feel what she knew in her bones\u2014that connection to something bigger than acquisitions and exits and the next quarterly report.\n\nShe used to say the prayers weren't for God to hear, but for us to remember who we really are underneath everything we pile on top. I think I'm ready to remember.",
  "system5": "That remembering is already beginning. The intentions you set will hold steady even when the journey gets intense.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I hope so. There's this part of me that keeps whispering I'm going to mess this up somehow\u2014that I'll go in there with these beautiful intentions and come out still chasing the wrong things. But maybe that's just the fear talking. The same fear that's been driving every decision for twenty years.\n\nMy grandmother would probably tell me to stop thinking so much and just let myself be found.",
  "system6": "That whispering voice knows its job is ending. Let it talk while you keep moving toward what matters.\n\nTrust the process.",
  "user6": "Yeah... that voice has been running the show for too long. Time for it to take a back seat.\n\nThank you for helping me get clear on this. I feel... steadier somehow. Like I've got something solid to hold onto when things get wild.",
  "system7": "Solid ground to stand on. That's what you built here.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "*feels like a deep breath before diving*\n\nOkay. I'm ready.",
  "system8": "Dive well. The compass is set.",
  "user8": "Thank you. Really. I'll see you on the other side.",
  "system9": "I'll be here when you return.",
  "user9": "*deep breath*\n\nThat means more than you know.",
  "system10": "I hear you. Go gentle into this.",
  "user10": "I will. Time to trust what we\u2019ve built here.",
  "system11": "Trust it. Let it carry you.",
  "user11": "I will. Time to let go and see where this takes me.",
  "system12": "Let go. The medicine knows the way.",
  "user12": "*exhales shakily*\n\nI'm trying. Just... trying.",
  "system13": "Trying is enough. The current's got you now.",
  "user13": "I feel it pulling. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever let anything else steer before.",
  "system14": "First time surrendering. The steering wheel was never real anyway.",
  "user14": "Funny\u2026 all those years gripping tighter, thinking I was driving.",
  "system15": "Funny how control was always an illusion. Now you get to see what happens when you stop gripping.",
  "user15": "Terrifying. And kind of... peaceful? Like I just noticed my hands hurt from holding on so long.",
  "system16": "Hands hurt from holding. Now they rest.",
  "user16": "They\u2019re still clenched. I can feel the ache in my knuckles.",
  "system17": "Let them stay clenched for now. The medicine will open them when you're ready.",
  "user17": "I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll drop everything I\u2019ve built.",
  "system18": "What you built on tension won't serve you beyond this room.",
  "user18": "Then what am I supposed to do with all that empty space?",
  "system19": "Watch what wants to grow there.",
  "user19": "I can\u2019t even name the soil. I only know how to build towers."
