  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I don't know. I've been chasing achievements my whole life, and now that I've sold my company and have all this freedom, I feel more lost than ever. My ibogaine ceremony is in three weeks, and I'm terrified I'll just find more emptiness on the other side.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this knowing about what's important. I want to find that in myself, but I don't even know where to start looking.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond achievements\n2. Reconnecting with the grounded faith your grandmother carried\n3. Discovering direction when external success feels empty\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those threads feel right. I keep circling around them but never quite landing.\n\nI want to trust there's something deeper than the next milestone, but I'm scared I'm just wired for achievement. Like maybe that's all I know how to be. My grandmother would probably laugh at me - she always said I was looking in the wrong places for the right things.\n\nI guess... I want to find what she saw in me before I started proving myself.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what matters beyond external achievements\n2. I reclaim the grounded wisdom my grandmother carried\n3. I trust there's something deeper than the next milestone\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one that makes my chest tighten. My grandmother... she saw something in me before I became this version of myself who only knows how to win. She used to call me her \"little light.\" I haven't felt like light in years.\n\nI want to know if that part of me still exists under all this drive and proving.",
  "system3": "Based on that thread:\n\n2. I reclaim the light my grandmother saw in me before I started proving myself\n\nHow do the other two land now?",
  "user3": "They feel... connected. Like pieces of the same puzzle I've been trying to solve in the wrong order.\n\nThe first one - about discovering what matters beyond achievements - it's like I've been asking the question but looking for the answer in business metrics. Maybe the answer isn't something to discover, it's something to remember.\n\nAnd trusting there's something deeper... I think that's what scared me most about this whole journey. What if I let go of the ladder and there's nothing underneath? But maybe that's the point - maybe I'm supposed to find out I don't need to climb anymore to be enough.\n\nYeah. All three matter. But that second one... that's where everything else starts.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I remember what matters beyond external achievements\n2. I reclaim the light my grandmother saw in me before I started proving myself\n3. I trust there's something deeper than the next milestone\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I didn't expect it to feel this... right. I've been approaching this like another project to optimize, another box to check. But these aren't about doing more, are they? They're about being less.\n\nThank you. I think I needed someone else to name what I've been too afraid to admit I want.",
  "system5": "Exactly. These aren't another achievement to chase - they're directions to point toward when you stop climbing.\n\nThe medicine will show you what you need. Trust these will be there when you need to remember what matters.",
  "user5": "When I stop climbing... I've never actually tried that before. Even in all my retreats, I think I've been looking for the next summit instead of just standing still long enough to feel the ground under my feet.\n\nMaybe that's what my grandmother knew - how to just be.",
  "system6": "That's it. She knew how to stand still and feel the ground.\n\nThree weeks to practice being instead of climbing. The intentions will hold that space for you.",
  "user6": "Three weeks to practice... being. I don't even know what that looks like for me. My default is planning and optimizing and moving forward. \n\nBut maybe that's exactly why I need this.",
  "system7": "You don't need to know what it looks like. You just need to notice when you're reaching for the next ladder and pause.\n\nThe practice starts now - in these weeks before your journey.",
  "user7": "Notice when I'm reaching... okay. That I can do. I caught myself this morning already - woke up and immediately started planning my day, my week, my next quarter. \n\nI paused. For maybe thirty seconds. Watched the steam from my coffee instead of drinking it while answering emails. Felt... weird. Like I was doing something wrong.\n\nBut yeah. I'll keep noticing.",
  "system8": "That's the work. Thirty seconds of noticing is thirty seconds of not climbing.\n\nKeep catching yourself. The weird feeling is just unfamiliar - not wrong.",
  "user8": "The weird feeling... yeah. It feels like I'm cheating or something. Like standing still is lazy when there's so much I could be doing. \n\nBut I'll keep practicing. Thirty seconds at a time.",
  "system9": "Thirty seconds isn't cheating - it's the practice. \n\nKeep going.",
  "user9": "I will. Thanks for holding this space with me. It's... I don't know, comforting to know someone's watching me try to figure out how to just stand still for once.",
  "system10": "I'm here. Keep noticing those thirty seconds.",
  "user10": "I will. And... thank you. For helping me see that this isn't about adding another skill to master - it's about unlearning the climb.",
  "system11": "Exactly. Unlearning, not mastering.\n\nYou're on your way.",
  "user11": "Unlearning. Yeah. That's... that's going to take some getting used to. But I'm starting to see how this connects to everything - why I keep feeling empty even when I'm \"winning.\"\n\nThanks for helping me begin to see it differently.",
  "system12": "That connection - why the wins feel hollow - that's worth following.\n\nKeep noticing.",
  "user12": "Following it... okay. I can feel it there, just beneath the surface. Like there's something real underneath all the performance, but I've been too busy climbing to notice what it actually is.\n\nI'll keep watching for it.",
  "system13": "Good. Watch for what's underneath without needing to name it yet.\n\nKeep noticing.",
  "user13": "I don't need to name it yet. That's... that's different for me. Usually I need to categorize everything, figure out what box it belongs in.\n\nBut I can just... notice. Without labeling.",
  "system14": "Just notice. Let it be what it is without the box.\n\nYou're getting it.",
  "user14": "Without the box. Yeah... that's going to be the hardest part. But maybe that's exactly why I need to do this.",
  "system15": "Exactly. The hardest part is probably the work.\n\nKeep at it.",
  "user15": "The hardest part is the work. Of course it is. I've been avoiding this exact thing my whole life\u2014letting go of the boxes, the achievements, the identity I built.\n\nBut I can't keep running from it anymore.",
  "system16": "Then stop running.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user16": "Stop running. Just... stop. \n\nI feel like I'm standing at the edge of something terrifying and real. But for the first time, I'm not sure I want to turn back.",
  "system17": "That's the place. Right there.\n\nStay with it.",
  "user17": "I'm here. It's... I don't have words for this. Just this raw, open space where all my old tricks don't work anymore.\n\nI'll stay.",
  "system18": "Stay with it. That's all the intention you need.\n\nYou're doing the work.",
  "user18": "That's all the intention I need. Just... stay.",
  "system19": "Stay.",
  "user19": "Stay."
