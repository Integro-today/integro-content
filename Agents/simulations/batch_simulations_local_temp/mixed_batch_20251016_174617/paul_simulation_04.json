  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this intention stuff might help with... everything. My marriage, the nightmares, all of it. I can't keep going like this - Amanda's looking at me like I'm a stranger these days.\n\nI guess I need to figure out how to stop waking up angry. And how to talk to her without snapping. The plant medicine thing... I don't buy into all that, but these guys seem to know what they're doing.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up angry\n2. Talk to Amanda without snapping\n3. Reconnect with your wife instead of feeling like strangers\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those three things. That's... that's it right there.\n\nI need to stop waking up ready to fight ghosts that aren't there. Need to figure out how to talk to Amanda without this edge in my voice that makes her flinch. And damn it, I need to remember what it felt like when she didn't look at me like I'm about to explode.\n\nHow do we... how do we turn those into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I wake up calm and grounded\n2. I speak to Amanda with steady presence\n3. I become the man she used to recognize\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The third one hits hardest. \"I become the man she used to recognize.\" That's... that's what I need. Not some new version of me - just getting back to who I was before all this crap took over.\n\nBut the first one... \"I wake up calm and grounded.\" That feels too soft. Like yoga music or something. I need something stronger. More direct.\n\nAnd the second one - I don't just want steady presence. I want to stop hurting her with my words. There's got to be a way to say that without sounding like I'm asking to be turned into some... I don't know... gentle version of myself.\n\nCan we make these sound less like therapy posters?",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I wake up without the fight in me\n2. I speak words that don't wound Amanda\n3. I become the man she used to recognize\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "That's better. Much better.\n\n\"I wake up without the fight in me\" - yeah, that's what I want. Not calm or grounded, just... not ready to battle.\n\n\"I speak words that don't wound Amanda\" - that cuts right to it. I don't need to be some gentle soul. Just need to stop being the guy who makes her flinch.\n\nAnd the third one stays. That's the one that matters most. The man she used to recognize - the one who could hold her without her tensing up. The one who didn't make her walk on eggshells in her own house.\n\nThese feel like something I could actually say and mean. Not some soft bullshit about finding my inner whatever. Just... fixing what's broken without breaking myself in the process.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I wake up without the fight in me\n2. I speak words that don't wound Amanda\n3. I become the man she used to recognize\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Good. These feel... right. Like I can carry them without feeling like I'm carrying some kind of self-help nonsense.\n\nKeep 'em close, I guess. See if this plant stuff actually does anything, or if I'm just another sucker who flew to Costa Rica looking for answers.\n\nBut at least now I know exactly what I'm looking for.",
  "system5": "Exactly. You know what you're looking for. That's the compass.\n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust the process.",
  "user5": "Trust the process. Right. That's the part that doesn't come easy - trusting anything I can't control.\n\nBut I'm here. I said the words. Now I just... show up. Do the work. See what happens.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll know if this was worth it.",
  "system6": "Three weeks. You show up, do the work, see what happens.\n\nThat's all any of us can do.",
  "user6": "Yeah. That's all any of us can do.\n\nShow up. Do the work. See what happens.\n\nI can do that.",
  "system7": "You can.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I can.",

  "user11": "I... I need to stop waking up like I'm still in the cockpit. Need to sleep through the night without Amanda having to calm me down like some damn kid.\n\nI need to figure out how to be... softer. Not weak, just... I don't know. Less angry all the time. She deserves better than what I'm giving her.\n\nAnd I need to protect them - Amanda and the kids. If I can't get this under control, I'm gonna lose everything I came back for.",
  "system12": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without the cockpit dreams\n2. Become softer - less angry, more present\n3. Protect Amanda and the kids by getting this under control\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user12": "Yeah. Those are the three. Need to get 'em right.",
  "system13": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I release the anger that pushes my family away\n3. I protect my family by healing what's broken\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user13": "The second one... \"release the anger.\" I don't want to release it. I need it. It's kept me alive, kept me sharp. I just need to... aim it somewhere else. Not at them.\n\nMaybe... \"I learn to control the anger so it stops hurting my family.\" Something like that.",
  "system14": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I learn to control the anger so it stops hurting my family\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user14": "First one's good. Simple. Direct. That's what I need - just sleep through the damn night.\n\nThird one... \"protect my family by healing what's broken.\" I don't know. \"Broken\" feels too... I don't know. Maybe \"protect my family by facing what's haunting me.\" That's more accurate.",

  "system16": "Exactly. They'll be right there on your dashboard when you need them.\n\nYou're ready.",
