  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help me sleep better, stop waking up the whole damn house. That's it. I'm not looking for some... spiritual awakening or whatever you call it.\n\nI just need to stop being so angry all the time. Amanda says she doesn't know who I am anymore. My kids... they walk around me like I'm some bomb about to go off. I hate that.\n\nBut I'm not broken. I did my job, came home, built a good life. I just need to figure out how to shut off whatever's making me wake up screaming.",
  "system1": "Four threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking the house\n2. Stop being angry all the time\n3. Show my kids they don't need to fear me\n4. Reclaim the man Amanda recognizes\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are right. Especially the kids part. Saw my youngest flinch when I slammed the table last week. Just dropped my glass, wasn't even mad. But he looked at me like I was... I don't know. Someone else.\n\nI want to sleep without seeing their faces. The ones I couldn't... the ones that didn't... I want to stop seeing them when I close my eyes.\n\nAnd I want Amanda to look at me the way she used to. Before I became this... whatever I am now. She used to feel safe with me.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I release the faces that haunt me\n3. I make my family feel safe again\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user2": "The second one... I can't just release them. They're not some... I don't know, ghosts I can banish. They're real people. Real boys who didn't get to go home to their mamas because I was doing my job.\n\nI don't want to forget them. That feels wrong, like I'd be abandoning them again. I just want to stop seeing them every time I try to sleep. Want to stop feeling like I'm still there, like any second an alarm's gonna go off and I gotta run to the bird.\n\nMaybe it's more about... carrying them different? Not letting them take over everything else?",
  "system3": "I carry them with honor instead of letting them hijack my life.",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that's better. I can still have their backs, still be their wingman, but not... not let it wreck everything here. Not let it turn me into someone my own kids are scared of.\n\nI can carry them like they deserve. With honor. Not like this... whatever this is now.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I carry them with honor instead of letting them hijack my life\n3. I make my family feel safe again\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll... I'll keep these close. Maybe write 'em down, keep 'em in my wallet next to my wings. Been carrying those for years - seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks. I can do this.",
  "system5": "Solid plan. Keep them close, let them work.\n\nThree weeks is plenty of time. The medicine knows what to do with what you've set.",
  "user5": "Yeah... okay. I'll trust the process. Trust that these folks at Heroic Hearts know what they're doing, even if I don't understand it yet.\n\nAppreciate you helping me get this straight. Feels like I got something solid to hold onto now.",
  "system6": "You do. Trust that steady feeling - it's real.\n\nYou're ready.",
