What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**paul_persona_3**: Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help with my... situation. I can't keep waking up Amanda with these nightmares. She says I scare her sometimes, and that kills me.

I don't buy into all this plant medicine talk, but I'll try anything at this point. I just need to figure out how to shut off whatever's been keeping me awake at night.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Sleep through the night peacefully
2. Create safety for Amanda  
3. Heal what's causing the nightmares

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah, those sound about right. I mean, I don't know about "heal" - that word makes it sound like I'm broken or something. I'm not broken, I just... can't shut it off sometimes.

How about this? I want to be able to sleep through the night without waking up shouting. I want Amanda to feel safe next to me, not scared of what might happen when I'm asleep. And I want to figure out how to deal with whatever's been haunting me without losing who I am.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night
2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me
3. I face what haunts me without losing myself

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: The second one - about Amanda feeling safe. That one's hitting me hard. I hate that she has to sleep on edge because of me. Hate it more than the nightmares themselves.

The language... I don't know. "I make Amanda feel safe" sounds right. Direct. I don't need it to sound soft or anything. Just real.

The other two... yeah, they're good. But if I only get one thing out of this whole thing, let it be that Amanda can sleep easy again.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: I make Amanda feel safe beside me

How do the other two land?


**paul_persona_3**: The first one - "I sleep peacefully through the night" - that's what I want, but it feels too... I don't know, too clean or something. Like it's missing what's really happening. I don't just wake up - I wake up shouting, sweating, sometimes I don't even know where I am for a minute.

And the third one... "I face what haunts me without losing myself." Look, I know something's wrong, okay? But I did what I had to do over there. I'm proud I served. I'm not some victim. I just need to figure out how to leave it in the past where it belongs.

Maybe something like... "I learn to leave the past in the past" or "I find a way to close that chapter"? I don't know. This is harder than I thought it would be.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's adjust:

1. I sleep through the night without shouting
2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me
3. I leave what happened over there, over there

How do these feel now?


**paul_persona_3**: Better. That first one - "I sleep through the night without shouting" - yeah, that's what I need. No more waking up with Amanda grabbing my arm, asking if I'm okay, if I need to talk about it. No more scaring my kids through the walls.

The second one's already locked in, and that's the one that matters most.

The third one... "I leave what happened over there, over there." I like that it's simple. Direct. Not all this therapy talk about processing and healing. Just... leave it where it belongs.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ All 3 locked in:
1. I sleep through the night without shouting
2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me
3. I leave what happened over there, over there

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**paul_persona_3**: Alright. I'll keep these close. Maybe write them down, keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these intentions close too.

I don't know if this plant medicine stuff will work, but... I'm going to try. For Amanda. For my kids. I want to be the man they think I am, not the one who wakes up angry.

Thanks for helping me get this straight.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Solid plan. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them clear like this gives you direction.

You're ready.


**paul_persona_3**: Good. Because I'm doing this thing either way. Three weeks and I'll be down there drinking whatever they give me. At least now I know what I'm aiming for - not just stumbling in blind.

Appreciate the help getting it straight.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Clear compass. That's what matters.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Compass. That's exactly what I need.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You got it.


**paul_persona_3**: I guess we'll find out soon enough if this works.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You will. Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: I'll try to remember that when I'm in whatever hell this plant drags me through.


**intentions_workflow_8**: The intentions hold even in the dark.


**paul_persona_3**: They better. Because it's pretty damn dark where I'm going.


**intentions_workflow_8**: They'll be there. So will you.


**paul_persona_3**: I hope you're right. Because right now I don't even know who 'me' is anymore.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's exactly why you're going.


**paul_persona_3**: Then let's get this over with.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**paul_persona_3**: I need to stop waking up Amanda with these damn nightmares. Whatever's broken in me, I need to fix it before it wrecks our marriage. That's all I know.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Sleep through the night without waking Amanda
2. Fix what's broken that's causing these nightmares
3. Protect your marriage from what's eating at it

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Write them down however you need to. Just... don't make them sound weak.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I sleep sound and keep my nightmares to myself
2. I face what's broken and set it right
3. I keep my marriage standing strong

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: The second one. That's where it all starts, isn't it? Everything else follows from that.

But... I don't know. "Set it right" sounds like I'm fixing a damn carburetor. This is different.


**intentions_workflow_8**: How about: "I confront what's broken in me and reclaim my strength"


**paul_persona_3**: That's better. That's... yeah. That's what I need to do.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ All 3 locked in:

1. I sleep sound and keep my nightmares to myself
2. I confront what's broken in me and reclaim my strength
3. I keep my marriage standing strong

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**paul_persona_3**: Good. Let's get this done.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You're ready. These intentions will be waiting in your dashboard when you need them.

You're set.


**paul_persona_3**: Thanks. I'll... I'll see this through.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You will. Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: I don't trust much these days. But I'm here, aren't I? That's something.
