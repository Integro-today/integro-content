  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything, I guess. My marriage, the nightmares, not being so damn angry all the time. So here I am. \n\nCan't keep going like this. Amanda's at her wit's end, and I... I need to figure out how to be the man she married again. Not whatever I've become.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reclaim the man Amanda fell in love with\n2. Find peace from the nightmares \n3. Release this anger that's poisoning everything\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's about right. Those three things. \n\nI just... I don't want to lose who I am in the process, you know? I've been strong my whole life. Military, business, providing for my family. This idea that I need to \"heal\" or whatever... it feels like admitting I'm broken. But if I don't do something, I'm gonna lose everything anyway.\n\nSo how do we make these into... whatever you called them? Intentions?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the steady strength Amanda fell in love with\n2. I sleep peacefully through the night\n3. I channel my power toward protecting what matters\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I don't know... the second one feels too soft. \"I sleep peacefully\"? That's not really what I'm after. It's not just about sleeping. It's about not waking up screaming, not scaring my wife, not feeling like I'm back there every time I close my eyes.\n\nAnd the first one... \"steady strength\"? That sounds like something from a greeting card. I need to be the man who could protect her, who she felt safe with. Not whatever scared her enough that she's threatening to leave.\n\nThe third one's closer. But I don't just want to \"channel my power\" - I want to stop feeling like I need to fight everything all the time. Like I can finally stand down.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I become the man Amanda feels safe with again\n2. I end the nightmares that wake me screaming\n3. I stand down from constant battle and find peace\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, these feel right. Especially that last one. \"I stand down from constant battle and find peace.\" That's what I want. To not feel like I'm always ready to fight, always scanning for threats, always on edge.\n\nThe first one too - \"the man Amanda feels safe with again.\" That's exactly it. She used to look at me like I was her hero. Now she looks at me like I'm a bomb that might go off. I hate that more than anything.\n\nAnd the nightmares... I don't just want them to stop. I want to stop feeling like I'm losing my brothers all over again every time I close my eyes. Like I'm failing them again.\n\nThese feel like they fit.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I become the man Amanda feels safe with again\n2. I end the nightmares that wake me screaming\n3. I stand down from constant battle and find peace\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. They're... they're good. I'll carry these with me. \n\nJust... I don't know what I'm walking into with this medicine stuff. Never done anything like this before. But if it helps me keep my family together, helps me stop being this... this thing I've become, then I'll do whatever it takes.\n\nThree weeks. Guess I'll see what this plant can show me.",
  "system5": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what comes - you've got solid ground to stand on now.",
  "user5": "Solid ground... yeah. That's what I need. Something solid to stand on when everything else feels like it's falling apart.\n\nI just hope it's enough. Hope I'm enough.",
  "system6": "You built these intentions from what's already inside you. The medicine just helps you see it clearly.",
  "user6": "Right. From what's already inside me. \n\nI guess we'll see what's really in there when I can't hide from it anymore.",
  "system7": "The hiding ends when you're ready. The intentions will be waiting on your dashboard when you need them.",
  "user7": "Good. Because I don't know if I'm going to be ready for what comes up. But at least I'll have something to hold onto when it does.",
  "system8": "That's exactly right. You hold the compass, not the outcome.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I can do that. Hold the compass, not try to control the whole damn map. \n\nThat's... that's actually helpful. Thanks.",
  "system9": "You got this.",
  "user9": "I hope you're right. I really do.",
  "system10": "Trust builds as you walk. You'll know soon enough.",
  "user10": "Yeah. Walking into it is all I can do now. Three weeks and I'll be walking into something I can't even picture yet. \n\nJust gotta keep putting one foot in front of the other. Same as always.",
  "system11": "One foot, one breath, one moment. Same body, different landscape.",
  "user11": "Different landscape... that's for damn sure.\n\nNever thought I'd be the guy flying to Costa Rica to drink plant medicine. But here we are.",
  "system12": "Life takes us places we never planned. The path chooses us sometimes.",
  "user12": "Tell me about it. Three months ago I was just trying to sell policies and keep my head down. Now I'm packing for a jungle I can't even spell right.\n\nGuess the path had other plans.",
  "system13": "The path doesn't care about our plans. Just shows us what needs seeing.",
  "user13": "Yeah... and I'm starting to think I been looking away from what needs seeing for too damn long.",
  "system14": "That's why you're going. Time to look straight at it.",
  "user14": "Straight at it. No flinching. That's how we did it over there, and that's how I'll do this.",
  "system15": "Same discipline, different battlefield.",
  "user15": "Different battlefield... same enemy. Just this time it's in my own head instead of some desert.",
  "system16": "The real enemy follows us home. Desert or jungle - doesn't matter where we fight when it's inside.",
  "user16": "Yeah. Been fighting it in my sleep for years now. Wake up with Amanda staring at me like I'm some stranger.\n\nMaybe it's time I stop pretending I don't know what I'm fighting.",
  "system17": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without the war following you home\n2. Make Amanda stop looking at you like you're dangerous\n3. Face what you've been pretending isn't there\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user17": "Yeah... three threads. That's it exactly.\n\nI want to sleep without the sky falling in my dreams. Want my wife to look at me like I'm her husband again, not some bomb that might go off. Want to stop lying to myself that I'm fine when I'm not.\n\nHow do I... how do I make those into something I can carry with me?",
  "system18": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety in my marriage\n3. I face what I've been hiding from myself\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user18": "Number two. \"Reclaim safety\"\u2014sounds like I\u2019m asking for a damn permission slip. \n\nMake it: *I let Amanda feel safe with me again.*",
  "system19": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I let Amanda feel safe with me again\n3. I face what I've been hiding from myself\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "Alright. They're in my wallet now\u2014right next to my pilot's wings. Been carrying those for twenty years, guess it's time I carry something for the real fight."
