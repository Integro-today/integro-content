  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat in a few weeks and... I guess I'm hoping to finally figure out what I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life. I've built and sold my company, I've got more money than I need, but I feel like I'm wasting time on things that don't matter. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to feel that kind of connection to something bigger than myself. Not just during ceremonies, but when I'm sitting in board meetings or helping my kids with homework.\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm chasing something that doesn't exist.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding purpose beyond building and selling companies\n2. Reconnecting with grounded faith like your grandmother had\n3. Feeling connection to something bigger in daily life\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? \n\nI want to find work that serves something bigger than my ego or bank account. Something that uses my skills but actually matters. And I want to stop feeling like I'm performing all the time - like there's this version of Ellen that everyone expects, and I'm just... tired of being her.\n\nMy grandmother used to light candles on Friday nights and it wasn't just ritual - it was like she was plugging into something. I want to feel plugged in again. Not through more achievements, but through... I don't know how to say this without sounding clich\u00e9. Through being present, maybe? Through showing up fully?\n\nI guess I want to know what I'm here for, beyond all the striving.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover work that serves something bigger than my ego\n2. I show up as my real self, not the performance of Ellen\n3. I plug into the grounded presence my grandmother knew\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - \"I show up as my real self, not the performance of Ellen\" - that hits hard. Because I don't even know who that is anymore. I've been playing this role for so long... high achiever, successful entrepreneur, board member, whatever. It's exhausting but it's safe.\n\nThe third one feels important too, but \"plug into\" sounds too mechanical. My grandmother wasn't plugging into anything - she was... opening? Receiving? I don't know the right word.\n\nAnd the first one... I want to discover work that serves, but I also want to stop needing work to define me at all. Maybe that's too much to ask from one ceremony though.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I discover work that serves something bigger than my ego\n2. I show up as who I am beyond the performance\n3. I receive the grounded presence my grandmother embodied\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "The second one - \"I show up as who I am beyond the performance\" - yes. That's it. That's what I want. To stop feeling like I'm always on stage, always managing how I come across. My kids see through it already. They're always asking why I'm \"different\" at home versus when we have people over.\n\nThe third one... \"receive\" is better than \"plug into,\" but it still feels like I'm making it too complicated. She just... was. She lit those candles and she was fully there. Not trying to receive anything, just being present to what was already there.\n\nMaybe that's what I want. To just be present to what's already here, instead of always reaching for the next thing.",
  "system4": "1. I discover work that serves something bigger than my ego\n2. I show up as who I am beyond the performance\n3. I am present to what's already here\n\nThese feel right?\n\nLet's lock them in.",
  "user4": "Yeah... these feel right. I mean, I'm scared of what they might actually mean. Being present to what's already here? That means I have to stop running, stop planning, stop fixing. But yes, these are what I want.\n\nLet's lock them in.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I discover work that serves something bigger than my ego\n2. I show up as who I am beyond the performance\n3. I am present to what's already here\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I feel... I don't know how I feel, actually. Lighter, maybe? Or maybe just more honest about how heavy it's been.\n\nI'll carry these with me. See what the medicine has to show me about them.",
  "system6": "That honesty about the weight - that's real. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah. It is heavy. But maybe that's okay. Maybe I don't have to fix the weight, just... carry it differently.",
  "system7": "Exactly. Carry it differently. Let the medicine show you how.",
  "user7": "I want to believe it can show me. But what if it shows me something I can't unsee? What if I come back and I can't play Ellen anymore - the successful one, the one who has it all together? My kids need stability. My investors need... something. \n\nWhat if I lose the only version of me that knows how to function in the world I built?",
  "system8": "The fear makes sense - you're standing at an edge. But you're not jumping blind. These intentions you set aren't about destroying what works, they're about finding what's real underneath it all.\n\nThe medicine rarely takes away what truly serves you. It just strips away what never was you.",
  "user8": "What if the thing that serves me is also the thing that's killing me? This version - Ellen the founder, Ellen the board member, Ellen who always knows what to do - she's been my armor and my cage. My kids don't even know me without her.",
  "system9": "Then maybe you meet what's underneath the armor before you decide what stays and what goes. The medicine won't force you to abandon your kids or burn your life down - but it might show you which parts are truly yours and which are just well-worn costumes.\n\nYou don't have to know today how to be both Ellen the protector and Ellen the real. Just let the process show you what's possible.",
  "user9": "I keep thinking about my grandmother. She had this quiet strength - never raised her voice, but you knew exactly who she was. She wore her faith like it was sewn into her skin, not like a jacket she could take off when it wasn't convenient. \n\nI want to know what that feels like. To not be performing, just... being. But I don't even know where to start looking for that in myself.",
  "system10": "You already found the thread - your grandmother's quiet certainty. That's what drew you to her. The medicine will help you follow that thread inward, past all the performance layers you've built.\n\nYou don't need to know where to start. The intentions you set will point you there when the time comes.",
  "user10": "What if I follow that thread and there's nothing there? Just... emptiness. I've been so many versions of myself - the entrepreneur, the mother, the seeker - what if none of them are real? What if underneath it all, there's just... nothing?",
  "system11": "Then you meet the nothing and see what grows from that empty ground. Most people find it's not emptiness - it's just space that hasn't been filled with other people's expectations yet.\n\nThe real question isn't whether there's something there. It's whether you're willing to sit in that space long enough to find out.",
  "user11": "I'm scared I won't know how to sit still. That I'll panic and try to rebuild everything I just tore down, only faster this time. I've never been good at... just being. There's always another mountain, another company, another thing to fix.\n\nBut I'm tired of building mountains that don't matter.",
  "system12": "Then let's set intentions that give you something to hold when the urge to rebuild hits. Something more solid than another company, more real than another mountain.\n\nWhat matters enough to sit still for?",
  "user12": "My kids. When I'm with them at the park and we're just... existing together. Not doing, just being. Those moments when they're climbing trees or building fairy houses and I'm not checking my phone. I feel like I can breathe in a way I never can in boardrooms.\n\nAnd my grandmother's prayer shawl. I keep it in a box in my closet because I don't know what to do with it, but I can't throw it away either. Sometimes I take it out and just... hold it. It smells like her apartment - like cinnamon and old books.",
  "system13": "Two threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with your kids, breathing easy in those park moments\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's grounded wisdom - the quiet strength in that shawl\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "I want to learn how to carry that park-breathing into the rest of my life. Not just when I'm with my kids, but when I'm alone with myself. I want to know what it feels like to be still without needing to be useful.\n\nAnd I want to understand what my grandmother knew. Not just about faith, but about being rooted in something bigger than achievements. I want to wear my life like she wore her faith - like it was part of me, not something I put on and take off.\n\nI want to stop building mountains and start growing roots.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Carrying that park-breathing into every part of life - being still without needing to be useful\n2. Reclaiming your grandmother's rooted wisdom - faith and presence as part of you, not performance\n3. Growing roots instead of building mountains\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "I want to remember how to breathe like I'm in the park even when I'm alone and scared. I want to stop measuring my worth by what I build and start measuring it by how honestly I can sit with myself.\n\nI want to understand what my grandmother's shawl was trying to teach me - that there's strength in softness, power in stillness. I want to stop running from empty space and start learning what grows there.\n\nI want to trade my mountain-building for root-growing. To find out what it means to be planted instead of climbing.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I breathe with the same ease whether I'm in the park with my kids or alone with my fear\n2. I discover what grows in empty space when I stop running from it\n3. I trade mountain-building for root-growing and learn what it means to be planted\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user15": "The first one feels... impossible. Like asking me to stop being me. But maybe that's the point.\n\nThe second one terrifies me. What if nothing grows? What if I've been running from nothing all along?\n\nThe third one makes me want to cry and I don't know why. Maybe because I don't know how to be planted. I only know how to climb, how to strive, how to reach the next thing.\n\nBut something in me is so tired of climbing. So tired of always needing to be somewhere I'm not.",
  "system16": "Let's adjust the first one to meet you where you are:\n\n1. I practice breathing with ease, even when it feels impossible\n2. I discover what grows in empty space when I stop running from it\n3. I trade mountain-building for root-growing and learn what it means to be planted\n\nThe tears make sense - you're naming something that's been true for a long time.",
  "user16": "I can work with that. I can practice even when it's hard. God knows I've practiced harder things - building companies, raising capital, scaling teams. Breathing shouldn't be impossible, right?\n\nThe tears are still there, though. It's like... I spent forty years becoming someone I'm not sure I want to be anymore. And now I'm supposed to just... unbecome that person? In front of my kids? In front of myself?\n\nBut yes. I'm tired of the climb. I want to know what it feels like to be enough without the next mountain to prove it.",
  "system17": "Three intentions:\n\n1. I practice breathing with ease, even when it feels impossible\n2. I discover what grows in empty space when I stop running from it\n3. I trade mountain-building for root-growing and learn what it means to be planted\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in.\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user17": "Thank you. I'll carry these with me. I'll probably need to read them a hundred times when I wake up at 3 AM thinking about everything I'm not building, everything I'm not becoming. But maybe that's the practice - picking them up again when I forget.\n\nI think... I think I understand why I chose the eagle and antelope. I've been all eagle - flying high, seeing everything from above. But I need the antelope too. Grounded, alert, part of the earth instead of above it.\n\nI don't know if I'll be different after this journey. But I want to try being more antelope than eagle for once.",
  "system18": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they become part of you whether you're aware of them or not.\n\nEagle and antelope both belong. You don't have to choose one forever.",
  "user18": "That's... relieving. I keep thinking I have to pick one way of being and stick with it forever. Like I have to decide right now if I'm going to be the woman who builds mountains or the one who grows roots.\n\nBut maybe I can be both. Maybe I can still use my eagle vision when I need it, still build things that matter. Just... from the ground. With roots holding me steady.\n\nI don't have to throw away everything I've learned. Just... stop running from the empty spaces.",
  "system19": "Exactly. You don't erase the eagle - you just stop needing to be airborne all the time.\n\nThe roots will hold you when you need to fly. The empty spaces aren't your enemy anymore.",
  "user19": "I think I'm starting to understand. The empty spaces aren't failures - they're where the roots grow. Where I remember how to breathe without trying so hard.\n\nI've been so busy proving I deserve to exist that I forgot I already do.\n\nMaybe that's what I need to remember during this journey. That I can stop proving, stop climbing, stop trying to earn my breath. I already have it."
