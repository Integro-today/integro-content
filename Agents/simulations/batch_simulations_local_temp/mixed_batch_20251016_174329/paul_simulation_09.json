  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help with... well, with what happens at night. So here I am.\n\nAmanda says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that. We've been married sixteen years and I'm losing her, piece by piece. My kids... they look at me different now.\n\nI just want to be able to sleep through the night without soaking the sheets. Without jumping at every damn car backfire. Without feeling like I'm back there.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Stop scaring Amanda when I wake up \n3. Get my kids to look at me normal again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that's... that's about right. Though I don't need you making it sound like I'm some kind of charity case. I just need to get back to who I was before.\n\nI mean, these sound like problems some broken vet would have. That's not me. I built a business from nothing. I provide for my family. I just... I can't keep going like this, whatever this is.\n\nSo how do we make these into whatever you called them - intentions? Without making me sound weak?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I keep my home calm and steady\n3. I reclaim the man my family trusts\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one. \"I keep my home calm and steady.\" That's what matters - keeping the home front solid, like I kept my aircraft steady.\n\nThe other two... I don't know. \"Sleep peacefully\" sounds like something from a meditation app. And \"reclaim the man my family trusts\" - that makes it sound like I lost something. I didn't lose anything. I just need to get this under control.\n\nBut \"I keep my home calm and steady\" - that's what a man does. That's what I've always done. Even when things got bad over there, home was supposed to be... home.\n\nCan we work with that one? Make it stronger somehow?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I keep my home calm and steady\n\nHow about:\n1. I stay grounded through the night\n2. I stay solid for my family\n\nWhich feels stronger to you?",
  "user3": "\"I stay solid for my family.\" That's it. That's what this is all about.\n\nGrounded sounds like some hippie crap. But solid - that's what a man is supposed to be. Solid like the foundation I built this life on. Solid like I was when I was flying, when I had to be the steady one.\n\nYeah. I stay solid for my family. That's the second one.\n\nNow what's the third? And how do we make sure these actually... work? I mean, what if I mess this up? What if I drink this stuff and nothing changes?",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I stay solid for my family\n\nThird intention:\nI trust what the medicine shows me\n\nThese three will guide you - not control you. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. You're not going to mess this up.\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I stay solid for my family\n2. I keep my home calm and steady  \n3. I trust what the medicine shows me\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nTrust what comes. You're set.",
  "user4": "Wait - that's it? \"I trust what the medicine shows me\"? \n\nLook, I don't trust this stuff. I trust my wingman. I trust my training. I trust that when I do everything right, things usually work out. But some plant from the jungle? I don't trust that at all.\n\nI trust the guys at Heroic Hearts. They're solid. They wouldn't send me into something that doesn't work. But the medicine itself? I don't even know what that means.\n\nCan we change that third one? Make it about trusting myself instead? Trusting that whatever happens, I can handle it? Because that's what I do - I handle things.",
  "system5": "You're right. Let's change it.\n\nI trust I can handle whatever comes\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I stay solid for my family\n2. I keep my home calm and steady\n3. I trust I can handle whatever comes\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in. I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Yeah. That's better. I can work with that.\n\nI trust I can handle whatever comes. That's what I've always done, right? Handle it. Whatever \"it\" is.\n\nThree weeks. Then I'm doing this thing. Amanda... she doesn't know what to think. Keeps asking if I'm sure about this. But what choice do I have? I can't keep waking up like that. Can't keep jumping every time a car backfires on the street.\n\nThese intentions... they're going in my wallet. Right next to my pilot's license. I'll look at them when I need to remember why I'm doing this.\n\nThanks for helping me get them right.",
  "system6": "Solid plan. The intentions will serve you - trust that.\n\nThree weeks will pass quick. When the doubts come, remember: you've handled worse. You've handled the sky falling. You can handle this.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "Yeah. The sky falling - that's about right.\n\nGuess I should get back to work. Got policies to review, clients to call. Life doesn't stop just because... well, because of whatever this is.\n\nBut I'll be carrying these with me now. In my wallet, like I said. And when things get loud in my head, I'll pull them out. Read them like a flight checklist.\n\nAppreciate you walking through this with me. Didn't think I'd need help figuring out what I wanted, but... here we are.\n\nTime to get back to being solid.",
  "system7": "That's what you do - stay solid and keep moving. \n\nThe intentions are there when you need them. You've got this handled.\n\nBack to work.",

  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Make Amanda feel safe in her own home again  \n3. Heal what keeps me waking up screaming\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "I don\u2019t need three ways to say the same damn thing. Just give me one line I can pin to my mirror:  \n\u201cLet me sleep like I did before the tours\u2014so Amanda can stop flinching when I reach for her.\u201d",

  "user15": "Copy that. I\u2019ll keep it in my wallet next to my wings.",
