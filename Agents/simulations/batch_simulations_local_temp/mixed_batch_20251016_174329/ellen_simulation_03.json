  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I don't know. I've been chasing achievements my whole life, and now that I've sold my company, I feel like I'm standing on this mountain with nothing left to climb. But it's hollow up here.\n\nMy grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything - she was this amazing Jewish mystic who saw God in the smallest things. And lately I keep thinking about her, about how she found meaning in service and community, not in building bigger and better. I want to find my way back to that, but I don't even know where to start.\n\nThe retreat is coming up and I'm terrified I'll have another profound experience that just... fades. Like all the others. I'll come home inspired, meditate for a week, then fall back into the same patterns. My kids deserve better than a mother who's physically present but mentally checking stock prices or board emails.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding meaning beyond achievements and external success\n2. Reconnecting with the grounded wisdom your grandmother embodied\n3. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the three things that keep circling in my head at 3am when I can't sleep. It's like I've been following this map that promised fulfillment, and I got to the destination and it's just... empty. \n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother could make you feel like you were the most important person in the world when she talked to you. She'd look at you with these eyes that really saw you, you know? Not what you could do or achieve, just... you. I want to learn how to do that. To stop measuring everything by what can be optimized or scaled.\n\nAnd my kids... God, they're growing up so fast. My daughter asked me to read her a book yesterday and I was scrolling through my phone, nodding along. She finally just took the book and walked away. I don't want to lose them while I'm busy building some next thing that doesn't even matter.\n\nSo how do we turn these into actual intentions? Ones that might actually stick this time?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover meaning beyond achievements and external success\n2. I reclaim the grounded wisdom my grandmother embodied\n3. I show up fully present when my children need me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about my grandmother - that one hits me in the chest. But \"reclaim\" feels... I don't know, too easy? Like I'm just going to walk in there and pick up where she left off, like it's some kind of inheritance waiting for me.\n\nShe didn't just have wisdom, she *lived* it. Every day. In how she made soup for sick neighbors and knew everyone's names at the market and could sit in silence for hours without needing to fill it. I want to *become* that kind of person, not just reclaim it like I'm picking up dry cleaning.\n\nMaybe something like \"I remember how to live with the grounded presence my grandmother embodied\" or... I don't know. I want it to feel like learning to breathe again, not checking another box.\n\nThe achievements one though - \"discover meaning beyond achievements\" - that feels right. It's exactly what I need to do. I've been so busy climbing I forgot to look around and see if the mountain was even worth climbing.\n\nAnd the kids... \"show up fully present when my children need me\" - that feels urgent. Like I can't afford to get this wrong anymore.",
  "system3": "\"I remember how to live with the grounded presence my grandmother embodied\"\n\nHow about:\n1. I discover meaning beyond achievements and external success\n2. I remember how to live with the grounded presence my grandmother embodied  \n3. I show up fully present when my children need me\n\nLock these in?",
  "user3": "Yes... these feel right. Like they're pointing me somewhere real instead of somewhere impressive.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother would probably laugh at me trying to turn this into an intention - she'd just say \"stop thinking so much and help me shell these peas\" - but maybe that's exactly why I need this. I've been living in my head for so long, optimizing and strategizing, that I forgot how to just... be.\n\nLet's lock them in.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I discover meaning beyond achievements and external success\n2. I remember how to live with the grounded presence my grandmother embodied\n3. I show up fully present when my children need me\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I feel... I don't know, lighter somehow? Like I've been carrying these three heavy stones in my pockets without realizing it, and now that I've named them, they're still there but they feel different. More like a compass than a burden.\n\nMy grandmother used to say that naming something is the first step toward welcoming it home. I think I understand that now.",
  "system5": "You named what matters. That changes everything.\n\nTrust these to carry you where you need to go.",
  "user5": "I will. And maybe this time I won't come back trying to turn the experience into a TED talk or a business model. Maybe I'll just... let it change me.\n\nFunny how the scariest thing about all this isn't the medicine itself - it's the possibility that I might actually have to stop being who I've been.",
  "system6": "Letting go of who you were is harder than any journey. The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user6": "Yeah... it's like I've been wearing this armor so long I don't know what's underneath anymore. Maybe that's why I keep going back to these medicines - somewhere deep down I know I can't take this thing off by myself.\n\nMy grandmother would probably just smile and say \"you're not becoming someone new, bubeleh, you're remembering who you always were before the world told you who to be.\" \n\nI hope she's right.",
  "system7": "She is right. The armor isn't who you are - it's what protected you. Time to set it down.",
  "user7": "I want to believe it's that simple. Just... set it down. But what if I set it down and there's nothing there? What if I've been so good at being what everyone needed me to be that I forgot to be anything for myself?\n\nMy kids - they see through me sometimes. My daughter asked me last week why I always look like I'm somewhere else even when I'm sitting right next to her. I didn't have an answer for her.\n\nMaybe that's what terrifies me most. That I'll go through all this and still not know how to just... be here.",
  "system8": "Being \"here\" is a practice, not a destination. Your daughter's already showing you the way - she sees through the armor because she remembers who you are underneath it.\n\nStart with today. One real moment with her. That's enough.",
  "user8": "You're right. She does remember - kids always do, don't they? Before we teach them to forget.\n\nI'll start there. Tonight when I'm helping with homework and my phone buzzes with some board meeting notification, maybe I just... don't look. Maybe I just stay right there with her confusion about fractions instead of jumping ahead to solve some problem that can wait until tomorrow.\n\nThat's the kind of presence my grandmother would recognize. She never rushed through anything, not even peeling potatoes. Said every moment deserved its full time.",
  "system9": "That's it. Give fractions your full time tonight. \n\nYour grandmother's wisdom lives in that choice.",
  "user9": "She's probably watching right now, shaking her head with that little smile she used to get when she knew I was about to learn something the hard way. \"You can finally stop running, Ellen,\" I hear her saying. \"You caught what you were chasing and it was never what you needed.\"\n\nOne moment at a time. Tonight it's fractions. Tomorrow... who knows? But maybe that's the point - not knowing, just being where my feet are.\n\nThank you. For helping me remember that remembering isn't something you do once and check off a list. It's something you practice, like prayer, like presence, like love.",
  "system10": "She's smiling because you finally heard her. \n\nKeep practicing. One fraction, one moment, one breath at a time.",
  "user10": "One breath at a time... funny how something so simple feels like learning to breathe all over again. But yeah, I hear her now. Really hear her.\n\nI'll keep practicing. Even when it feels like I'm doing it wrong - especially then.",
  "system11": "That's the practice - staying when it feels wrong. That's where the real breathing starts.",
  "user11": "Staying when it feels wrong... that's exactly what I've spent forty years perfecting the art of avoiding. Always had somewhere else to be, something bigger to build, another mountain to climb.\n\nBut my kids? They don't care about the mountains. They just want me here, breathing with them. Even when it's uncomfortable. Especially then.\n\nOkay. I'll stay.",
  "system12": "The mountains will wait. Your kids won't.",
  "user12": "God, that hits hard. They're 9 and 12 already... I swear I blinked and the baby years vanished. \n\nNo more missing it while I'm somewhere else in my head. I'm here now.",
  "system13": "Now's what you have. Nine and twelve won't come again.",
  "user13": "They won't. And I keep thinking I have time, that there'll be some perfect moment when I've figured everything out and then I can really be present. But those perfect moments? They're happening right now, in the middle of the mess, while I'm still confused and searching.\n\nMy daughter asked me yesterday if I remembered being nine. I told her I remembered trying to be perfect at nine. She just looked at me and said, \"But Mom, you don't have to be perfect to play with me.\"\n\nYeah. I'm done waiting to become someone worth being present for.",
  "system14": "Your daughter already sees who you are. Time to see yourself through her eyes.",
  "user14": "Through her eyes... she's never known the CEO, the founder, the woman who had to prove she belonged in every room. She just knows Mom - the one who burns the pancakes and sings off-key and sometimes cries in the car after school pickup.\n\nMaybe that's enough. Maybe that's who I'm supposed to be now.",
  "system15": "She doesn't need the CEO. She needs the mom who shows up, burnt pancakes and all.",
  "user15": "Burnt pancakes and all... that's what I keep forgetting. That showing up messy is still showing up.\n\nMy son actually likes the burnt parts. Says they're \"caramelized.\" Leave it to a kid to find the beauty in what I keep trying to hide.",
  "system16": "Kids find beauty in what's real. They don't need polished - they need present.",
  "user16": "Present... not perfect. That's what I'm learning to give them. What I'm learning to give myself too.\n\nI spent so many years polishing everything - my resume, my pitches, my image. Thought that's what made me valuable. But my kids? They don't care about any of that. They just want me here, fully here, even when I'm still figuring it out.\n\nThat's the intention, isn't it? To stop performing and start being. To trade the polished version for the real one.",
  "system17": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with my kids instead of performing for them\n2. Embracing my real, messy self instead of the polished version\n3. Finding worth in showing up as-is, not in perfect outcomes\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user17": "Yes... these three. Let me feel into them.\n\nWhen I'm with my kids, I want to catch myself before I drift into that familiar performance mode. Before I become \"productive mom\" or \"wise mom\" or whatever role I'm trying to fill. I want to pause and ask: am I here with them, or am I performing for them?\n\nAnd when I burn those pancakes - because I will - I want to laugh with them instead of apologizing for not being better. Let them see me learning to be human alongside them.\n\nThe worth piece... that's the hardest. I've spent forty-plus years tying my value to outcomes, to achievements, to getting it right. I want to practice being enough when nothing's being achieved. When we're just sitting on the couch reading, or walking to school, or... just breathing in the same space.\n\nI want to show them that love isn't something you earn by being impressive. It's something you receive by being real.",
  "system18": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present with my kids, not performing for them\n2. I embrace my real, messy self instead of hiding behind perfection\n3. I know I'm worthy when I'm achieving nothing, just being together\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user18": "They land... heavy in my chest, but in a good way. Like truth always does when you finally name it out loud.\n\nThe first one - \"show up fully present\" - that feels like learning a new language after speaking fluent business my whole life. But I want to learn it. I need to learn it.\n\nThe second one about embracing mess... I can feel my whole body want to argue with that one. But my kids? They're already living this. They don't wait to be perfect to dance, to sing, to love. They're teaching me.\n\nAnd that last one - worthy while achieving nothing - that's the revolution, isn't it? That's what all of this has been pointing toward. Not just for my kids, but for me. Finally giving myself permission to matter when I'm not producing, not optimizing, not winning.\n\nThese aren't just intentions for the journey. These are intentions for the rest of my life.",
  "system19": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I show up fully present with my kids, not performing for them\n2. I embrace my real, messy self instead of hiding behind perfection\n3. I know I'm worthy when I'm achieving nothing, just being together\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "Thank you. For helping me find the words I didn't know I was searching for. \n\nFunny - I came here thinking I needed to figure out my next big move, my next chapter. Turns out the real work is learning to stay still long enough to see what's already here.\n\nMy kids are going to love these burnt pancakes tomorrow morning."
