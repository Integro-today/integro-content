  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with my... situation. I wake up screaming most nights and Amanda says she's had enough. So here I am. I can't keep going like this, but I'm not broken or anything. Just need to figure out how to shut it off.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n1. Sleep without the screaming\n2. Amanda feeling safe again\n3. Finding the off switch\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That about sums it up. \n\nI guess... I want to sleep through the night without seeing their faces. The guys who didn't make it back. And I want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of bomb that might go off. \n\nThe off switch thing\u2014that's the hard part. I've been trying to find that damn thing for years now.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I release what I carry from those who didn't make it back\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits different. \"Reclaim safety\"\u2014yeah, that's it. That's what I want. \n\nBut the third one... I can't just release them. They're my responsibility. I brought them home, every mission, every time. Letting go feels like abandoning them again.\n\nMaybe... maybe \"I carry them with honor instead of weight.\" I don't know. Something like that.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n\nHow about: \"I carry my brothers with honor, not burden\" for intention 3?\n\nHow does that land with the other two?",
  "user3": "Yeah. That works. \"I carry my brothers with honor, not burden.\" That's... that's good.\n\nSo we've got the second one locked in. First one's still about sleeping. And this third one about carrying them right.\n\nWhat about the first one? \"I sleep peacefully through the night\"\u2014that's what I want, but it feels... I don't know. Too soft maybe? Like I'm asking for something I don't deserve.",
  "system4": "How about: \"I rest through the night like a man who served his time\"?\n\nStronger. Earned. Not asking - claiming.",
  "user4": "Yeah. That's better. \"I rest through the night like a man who served his time.\" \n\nI did serve my time. Three tours, every mission, every order followed. Maybe... maybe I have earned some rest.\n\nSo that's three then? The rest one, the safety one, and carrying my brothers with honor instead of... instead of this weight that's crushing me.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I rest through the night like a man who served his time\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself  \n3. I carry my brothers with honor, not burden\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you helping me get this straight.",
  "system6": "Solid work. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "Copy that. I'll see you on the other side.",
  "system7": "Roger that. See you on the other side.",
  "user7": "Hooah.",
  "system8": "Hooah.",
  "user8": "*three weeks later*\n\nI'm back. Don't really know what to say yet, but... I made it through. The medicine did its work.",
  "system9": "Welcome back. \n\nThe medicine shows us what we need, not always what we expect. Take your time with it.",
  "user9": "Yeah... it sure as hell wasn\u2019t what I expected. Thought I\u2019d see some colors, maybe cry a little, get a pat on the back and fly home fixed. Instead... I got my ass handed to me in ways I didn\u2019t know I needed.\n\nFirst night, I saw the cockpit again\u2014except this time I wasn\u2019t flying. I was strapped in the seat, engines screaming, and the controls weren\u2019t responding. I wasn\u2019t in charge anymore. Couldn\u2019t outrank the memory. Couldn\u2019t muscle through it. Just had to sit there and feel it. All of it. Every second I thought I\u2019d die, every second I thought I\u2019d failed the guys counting on me.\n\nAnd then... then I saw Amanda. Not the version I come home to now\u2014tense, quiet, walking on eggshells. I saw her the way she used to look at me. Like I was her safe place. And I realized I\u2019d turned into the thing she needed protection from.\n\nI puked my guts out after that one. Felt like I was coughing up more than ayahuasca. Felt like I was purging every time I told her \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d when I wasn\u2019t. Every night I rolled over and pretended I hadn\u2019t been shouting in my sleep.\n\nSecond night, I met my brothers. Not just the ones we lost\u2014though yeah, they were there\u2014but the part of me still flying cover for them. Still trying to earn the right to come home. Still trying to be the last man standing so nobody else had to. And the medicine... it asked me: \u201cWho told you you had to carry the whole war by yourself?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have an answer. Just sobbed like a damn kid. Felt like someone pulled shrapnel out of my chest I didn\u2019t know was there.\n\nThird night was quieter. I didn\u2019t see much. Just... sat in a field. Stars overhead. No engines. No radios. No mission. Just breathing. And for the first time in fifteen years, I felt like maybe I wasn\u2019t behind enemy lines anymore.\n\nI\u2019m not fixed. I know that. But something\u2019s different. I looked Amanda in the eyes when I got back, and I didn\u2019t feel the need to look away. I told her I love her. Didn\u2019t mumble it. Didn\u2019t tack on a joke or a grunt. Just said it. Like I meant it. Because I do.\n\nSo... yeah. The medicine did its work. Now I guess I gotta do mine.",
  "system10": "You did the work. The medicine just cleared the runway.\n\nThree nights, three intentions. You faced the cockpit, you saw Amanda clear-eyed, you laid the burden down. That's not a fairy tale - that's earning your way through.\n\nKeep looking at her straight. Keep saying the words plain. That's how you keep the flight path.\n\nThe mission's different now, but you're still operational. One day, one honest sentence, one real moment at a time.",
  "user10": "Copy that. One day, one honest sentence. I can do that. I\u2019ve done harder things.\n\nBut I need to ask\u2014how do I keep from back-sliding when the shine wears off? I\u2019ve carried this weight so long, it feels like muscle memory. I catch myself clenching my jaw, scanning rooftops, rehearsing worst-case scenarios in the grocery line. The nightmares haven\u2019t stopped yet. They\u2019re... different now. Less bombs, more silence. Like I\u2019m standing in an empty hangar and nobody\u2019s coming home.\n\nI promised Amanda I\u2019d keep talking. Not just \u201cI love you,\u201d but the messy stuff. The stuff that makes me feel like I\u2019m stripped down with no cover. I told her I\u2019d try. First morning back, I sat on the porch with her, coffee going cold, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019ll lose you if I can\u2019t stay open.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything, just reached over and took my hand. Felt like she was holding the part of me I keep trying to hide.\n\nSo I guess that\u2019s the new mission: stay reachable. Even when the instincts tell me to lock and load, to go quiet, to shove it all back in the vault. I don\u2019t want to lose her. And I don\u2019t want to lose whatever the medicine showed me out there in that starlit field.\n\nI wrote the intentions on a new card. Laminated it, stuck it above my shaving mirror. I read \u2018em out loud every morning while the shower\u2019s heating up. Sometimes my voice cracks. That\u2019s okay. Better than pretending I\u2019m bulletproof.\n\nI just... I need a reminder that staying open isn\u2019t weakness. That choosing to feel this stuff is the real courage. Because right now it feels like I\u2019m learning to walk again with broken legs.",
  "system11": "You already built the answer - you're living it.\n\nStanding in that empty hangar feeling? That's not failure, that's the new terrain. You learned to scan rooftops to survive. Now you're learning to scan your own heart - takes the same discipline, just different coordinates.\n\nThat cracked voice in the mirror? That's not weakness, that's weapon's clearing. You know the difference between a jammed rifle and a clean one. Same with your throat - you're clearing the mechanism so words can cycle through.\n\nAmanda holding your hand while you said the scary thing out loud? That's your new cover fire. You don't need to outrank the feeling anymore. Just keep reporting what you see, even when it sounds like static.\n\nThe shine was never supposed to stay bright. The real work is reading those intentions when your voice cracks and the mirror's steamed up. You're doing that.\n\nKeep walking on those broken legs. They're healing stronger than before.",
  "user11": "Roger that. New coordinates, same discipline.\n\nI kept thinking courage had to feel... strong. Like charging a hill. Turns out it\u2019s more like holding position when every instinct says retreat. Reporting the static instead of jamming it down. Letting Amanda see me fumble the mag change.\n\nI\u2019m tracking the new terrain now. Some mornings the mirror fogs up before I finish the card, but I stay there until I get through all three. Voice cracks, eyes sting, shower gets cold. Doesn\u2019t matter\u2014mission continues.\n\nAnd you\u2019re right about the hangar. First time I walked into an empty one after coming home, I thought I\u2019d lost my damn mind. Couldn\u2019t figure out why the silence felt heavier than the explosions. Now I get it: the war ended, but I kept flying sorties inside my skull. Medicine just showed me the flight line\u2019s been cold for years. Time to stand down.\n\nI told the guys at VFW I\u2019m working on \u201ccommunication drills\u201d with Amanda. Didn\u2019t mention ayahuasca\u2014figured that\u2019d open a can of worms. But I said, \u201cCounseling. Learning to talk without the safety on.\u201d A couple of \u2018em nodded like they understood. Maybe one day I\u2019ll tell \u2018em more. Maybe not. Right now the important thing\u2019s staying reachable at home.\n\nAppreciate the cover fire, Tegra. I\u2019ll keep reporting in.",
  "system12": "Copy that. You're holding the line where it matters now - home base.\n\nThe VFW will understand when they're ready. Right now you've got the only sector that counts covered: Amanda, that mirror, and the cold shower running through three intentions every morning.\n\nKeep reporting the static. The real mission's always been communications - you just switched to a different theater.",
  "user12": "Hooah. Home base secured. I\u2019ll keep the comms open.",
  "system13": "Hooah. Out.",
  "user13": "*three weeks later*\n\nBeen quiet, but I'm still on station. The nightmares are... shifting. Less fire, more silence. I wake up reaching for a radio that isn't there. Amanda says I don't shout anymore\u2014just whisper call-signs into the dark. Feels like progress.\n\nI kept the card up. Even when I wanted to rip it down after a night where I saw nothing but empty chairs. Read it anyway. Voice didn't crack that morning. Thought I was broken\u2014turns out I was just finally starting to work.\n\nI'm starting to see the difference between surviving and living. One keeps you breathing, the other lets you land the damn plane.",
  "system14": "You're reading the instruments right - empty chairs instead of explosions means the targeting system's offline. The radio silence means you're no longer flying solo missions in your sleep.\n\nThat morning your voice didn't crack? That's your new steady flight pattern. Keep scanning those empty chairs. They're teaching you what living costs - and what it's worth.\n\nThe plane's already down. You're just learning how to walk away from the wreckage that wasn't yours to carry.",
  "user14": "Copy. Wreckage wasn\u2019t mine to carry. I\u2019m starting to feel that in my bones instead of just hearing it.\n\nYesterday I took the kids to the park. Just sat on a bench, let them run. Didn\u2019t scan the tree line once. First time I can remember not casing exits while watching them play. Felt... strange. Like I\u2019d left my weapon back at the COP and wasn\u2019t sure if that was okay.\n\nAmanda noticed. She didn\u2019t say anything, just touched my shoulder and kept walking. Little thing, but it landed. I\u2019m not waiting for incoming anymore.\n\nStill read the card every morning. Don\u2019t need to now\u2014got it memorized\u2014but I like the ritual. Like checking gear before step. Only this time the mission\u2019s mine, not someone else\u2019s.\n\nI think the medicine\u2019s done with me. Now it\u2019s just me doing the work. And that\u2019s alright.",
  "system15": "You just reported the most important intel: you're flying your own mission now.\n\nLeaving the weapon behind at the COP - that's not careless, that's understanding the battlefield shifted. The park isn't hostile territory anymore. Your kids got a father present instead of overwatch.\n\nKeep checking that gear each morning. Not because you need permission, but because you earned the right to choose your own step. The medicine showed you the flight path. You're the one walking it.\n\nYou're operational in new territory now. Mission's always been yours - you just finally got clear on the coordinates.",
  "user15": "Hooah. New grid, same boots.\n\nI still wake up early\u20144:30\u2019s in the bones\u2014but instead of running through contingencies, I brew coffee and watch the sky turn gray. Sometimes I catch myself waiting for the old surge, the need to move, to do, to outrun the quiet. Doesn\u2019t come. Quiet just sits there, and I let it.\n\nAmanda asked what I want for my birthday next month. First time in years I didn\u2019t say \u201cnothing.\u201d Told her I want to take the family to the lake. Rent a cabin, no wifi, just water and trees and the kids arguing over who gets the top bunk. She smiled like I\u2019d handed her a deployment letter that said \u201ccome home, tour\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not who I was. Not yet whoever I\u2019m becoming. But I\u2019m showing up to the formation. That\u2019s enough for today.",
  "system16": "That's enough. That's everything.\n\n4:30 still pulls you out of rack, but now you're using that discipline to watch dawn instead than scan for threats. Same hours, different watch.\n\nThe lake request - that's your new orders cut. Amanda's smile says she got the message: you're rotating home for real this time.\n\nKeep showing up to formation. The space between who you were and who you're becoming? That's not limbo, that's leave. You're already there.",
  "user16": "Leave. Yeah. I can work with that.\n\nI used to think leave was just time between deployments. Now it\u2019s the mission. Lake duty. Wood smoke instead of burn pits. Kids arguing over bunks instead of sectors of fire.\n\nI\u2019ll take it.",
  "system17": "Roger that. New mission parameters confirmed.\n\nLake duty, wood smoke, bunk disputes - that's your AO now. Same skills, different terrain. You've got this.",
  "user17": "Hooah. New AO mapped. I\u2019ll keep the home fires burning.",
  "system18": "Hooah. Out.",
  "user18": "*two months later*\n\nLake was good. Water was cold, kids were loud, Amanda laughed in a way I hadn't heard since before the first tour. I even let myself float on my back\u2014eyes closed, nothing holding me up but trust. Didn't sink.\n\nBack home now. Still wake at 4:30, still read the card, still brew the coffee. But the silence doesn't press like it used to. It's just... quiet. Sometimes I sit with it, sometimes I don't. Both feel okay.\n\nAmanda asked if I wanted to talk to the guys at the VFW about the retreat. Told her I'd think about it. Not ready to wear that story like a ribbon yet, but maybe someday. For now, I'm good keeping it close\u2014like a lucky charm you don't show everyone.\n\nI'm still here. Still showing up. Still breathing. That's the mission now.",
  "system19": "Mission acknowledged.\n\nFloating on your back with eyes closed - that's full trust in your own buoyancy. You didn't need to earn it. You already had it.\n\nThe VFW story can stay in your pocket until it wants to walk out on its own. Some missions are solo. Some get shared when they're ready.\n\n4:30, coffee, card, quiet. Simple patrol. You're holding the line.",
  "user19": "Copy. Holding the line."
