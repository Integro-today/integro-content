  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I've got an ibogaine ceremony coming up at Beond in a few weeks. My retreat friends say intention-setting makes the difference between just having a wild experience and actually... I don't know, finding what you're looking for. \n\nI've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one cracked me open in different ways, showed me glimpses of something deeper. But then I come home and within weeks I'm back to the same patterns - checking emails at midnight, saying yes to every board request, feeling like I'm performing my life instead of living it.\n\nI guess I'm hoping ibogaine can help me finally hold onto whatever wisdom keeps slipping through my fingers.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop performing and start living your actual life\n2. Break the pattern of saying yes to everything that drains you\n3. Hold onto and embody the wisdom instead of losing it\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the loops I can't seem to break. It's like I know what I'm doing - performing, people-pleasing, losing myself - but I can't stop. Even when I'm hiking with the kids and feel that pure joy, by Monday I'm back to proving myself to people who probably don't even care.\n\nI need this ceremony to show me how to stop being a version of myself and just... be myself. Whatever that means.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live my life instead of performing it\n2. I say no to what drains me and yes to what sustains me\n3. I embody the real me and stop proving my worth\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I live my life instead of performing it\" - that hits different. It's like... when I was building my company, every milestone felt like another scene in a movie I was directing about success. Even these spiritual retreats, sometimes I catch myself wondering how they'll look in the story of my transformation.\n\nBut the language feels a little soft. Like it needs more teeth. Can we make it stronger? Something that reminds me I'm done with the show.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I drop the performance and live what's real\"\n\nStill captures what you said, but sharper.",
  "user3": "I drop the performance and live what's real.\n\nYeah. That lands. That feels like something I could actually remember when I'm tempted to say yes to the next board position or checking my phone during dinner with the kids.\n\nWhat's next?",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I drop the performance and live what's real\n\nHow do the other two land?\n\n1. I say no to what drains me and yes to what sustains me\n2. I embody the real me and stop proving my worth",
  "user4": "The second one about saying no... that's where I really get stuck. I've built this identity around being the reliable one, the closer, the person who makes things happen. When investors call, when nonprofits need funding, when the school needs someone to organize the auction - I'm there. But it leaves me depleted and somehow still feeling like I'm not doing enough.\n\n\"I say no to what drains me and yes to what sustains me\" - that feels like permission I need. But maybe we could make it even more direct? Like I'm not asking for permission anymore, I'm just... doing it.",
  "system5": "How about: \"I choose what sustains me and walk away from what drains me\"\n\nMore direct. No permission needed.",
  "user5": "I choose what sustains me and walk away from what drains me.\n\nThat's it. That feels like something I could actually do. Not perfectly - I know myself - but it's a direction I can keep coming back to.\n\nAnd the third one... \"I embody the real me and stop proving my worth\"... I think that's the hardest one of all. I've spent forty years proving, achieving, checking boxes. Even my spiritual journey sometimes feels like another accomplishment. Like I need to be the most enlightened version of transformation.\n\nBut yeah. I want to stop that.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I choose what sustains me and walk away from what drains me\n\nFor intention 3 - how about: \"I am enough without proving anything\"\n\nSimple. Direct. No more performance.",
  "user6": "I am enough without proving anything.\n\nThat... that actually makes my chest tight. Like I'm finally giving myself permission to just exist without the constant scorekeeping. Without wondering if I'm doing \"enough\" with my wealth, my time, my influence.\n\nI am enough without proving anything.\n\nYeah. I need that one.",
  "system7": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I drop the performance and live what's real\n2. I choose what sustains me and walk away from what drains me  \n3. I am enough without proving anything\n\nWrite them down. Keep them where you'll see them. Read them before the ceremony.\n\nThese are your compass when the medicine shows you what's underneath all that proving.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user7": "I'll write them in my journal tonight. Keep them on my nightstand where I can't miss them. Maybe even set them as my phone lock screen - though that feels a little ironic given the whole \"drop the performance\" thing.\n\nThank you. I... I needed this. These feel like they could actually guide me when things get intense. When the medicine starts peeling back those layers of achievement and control.\n\nI'll read them every morning with my coffee.",
  "system8": "Good. Trust what comes.\n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the words.",
  "user8": "Right. The remembering isn't about the exact words anyway. It's about... something deeper that these point to. Something I can't forget once I really feel it.\n\nI'm starting to understand why this matters.",
  "system9": "Exactly. The words are just fingers pointing at the moon.\n\nYou'll know what they mean when you feel it in your body.",
  "user9": "When I feel it in my body... that's the part that's been missing. All this intellectual understanding, all this talking about transformation - but I'm still living in my head most days.\n\nMaybe that's what I need to learn. How to feel again.",
  "system10": "The medicine will show you how to feel again.\n\nTrust that.",
  "user10": "I will. I need to.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way to these. I feel... steadier now. Like I have something real to hold onto when everything else falls away.",
  "system11": "You're ready. \n\nYour intentions will hold when everything else doesn't.",
  "user11": "They have to. Because everything else already isn't holding.\n\nI'm ready.",
  "system12": "Good. \n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user12": "I will. Even when it's hard. Especially then.",
  "system13": "That's the work.",
  "user13": "Then let\u2019s do it. Ibogaine, here I come.",
  "system14": "You're set.",
  "user14": "Then I\u2019ll see you on the other side.",
  "system15": "See you there.",
  "user15": "Thank you\u2014for everything.",
  "system16": "Walk well.",
  "user16": "I\u2019ll try. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.",
  "system17": "That\u2019s enough.",
  "user17": "Then I\u2019m ready.",
  "system18": "Go.",
  "user18": "Going.",
  "system19": "[Quiet nod. You\u2019re already on your way.]",
  "user19": "I\u2019m walking. One foot, then the other."
