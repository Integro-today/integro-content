  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me something important, but I keep losing the thread when I come home. I built this company, sold it, made more money than I'll ever need, but none of it feels like it matters anymore. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this way of being in the world that I've completely lost. I want to find my way back to something real, something that lasts beyond the retreat glow. But I'm terrified this will be just another experience I can't integrate.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding something real that lasts beyond the retreat glow\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet faith\n3. Actually living the insights instead of losing them when you get home\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? I've been chasing experiences but not building anything that sticks. \n\nI guess I'm scared that I'll go down there, have some profound realization about what matters, and then be back to checking emails during dinner with the kids two weeks later. It's like I know what I need to do - be more present, live with purpose, reconnect with that spiritual part of myself - but I can't seem to make it real in my actual life.\n\nWhat if I set the wrong intention and waste this opportunity? Ibogaine feels... heavier than the others. Like it demands more from you.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live what matters beyond the retreat glow, not just understand it\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in daily moments\n3. I show up present with my kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The third one hits me in the chest. \"I show up present with my kids instead of mentally elsewhere.\" That's... yeah. That's it. Last weekend we were at the park and I was on my phone during Lucy's soccer game. She scored and looked right at me, but I missed it because I was checking some stupid email about a board meeting.\n\nBut \"reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith\" - that feels too soft. She had this strength to her, this way of moving through the world with certainty. I need something stronger than \"reclaim.\"\n\nCan we make that second one more... grounded? Less ethereal? She wasn't floating around in some spiritual cloud - she was practical, real.",
  "system3": "\"I embody my grandmother's grounded certainty in daily life\"\n\nHow does that land?",
  "user3": "That's better. Grounded certainty - yes. She knew who she was, what mattered. Never had to prove anything to anyone. I want that.\n\nAnd the first one... \"I live what matters beyond the retreat glow, not just understand it.\" That's good, but it's missing something. I keep understanding things up here - *taps head* - but not living them. Maybe it needs to be more active? Like committing to actually doing something instead of just knowing I should?\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking this. I do that.",
  "system4": "\"I embody what matters beyond the retreat glow\"\n\nHow's that feel? More active - you're becoming it, not just thinking about it.",
  "user4": "Yes. That's it. I embody what matters beyond the retreat glow. Not just understanding with my head, but actually becoming it in my body, my choices, my daily life.\n\nAnd \"I show up present with my kids instead of mentally elsewhere\" - I want to keep that one exactly like that. It's specific, real. I can feel it every time I look at my phone instead of at them.\n\nSo we have:\n- I embody what matters beyond the retreat glow\n- I embody my grandmother's grounded certainty in daily life\n- I show up present with my kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nThese feel... right. Like they're calling me forward instead of just describing what I want to fix.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I embody what matters beyond the retreat glow\n2. I embody my grandmother's grounded certainty in daily life\n3. I show up present with my kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I'll write them down - keep them in my wallet like you said. Been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.\n\nI feel... I don't know. Lighter? Like I finally said out loud what I've been circling around for months. Maybe this time will be different. Maybe I can actually live these instead of just understanding them.\n\nI'll let you know how it goes.",
  "system6": "Good. Trust what comes.\n\nLet me know how it goes.",
  "user6": "I will. And... thanks for pushing past my usual deflections. I don't make it easy, I know that.\n\nI'll see this through.",
  "system7": "I know you will.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user7": "See you there.",
  "system8": "*closes the circle*",
  "user8": "*opens my eyes*",
  "system9": "Welcome back.\n\nHow did the medicine meet your intentions?",
  "user9": "It... it was different this time. Not the cosmic fireworks I expected. More like... being dismantled piece by piece until there was nothing left but this raw, trembling truth.\n\nI saw myself - really saw myself - and it was brutal. All the ways I've been performing my life instead of living it. The medicine showed me how hollow my achievements ring when I'm not embodied in them. How I've been chasing the next thing, always the next thing, because if I stopped... what would be left?\n\nBut then - and this is the part I need to hold onto - I felt my grandmother. Not as a memory, but as presence. Her certainty wasn't about having answers. It was about being rooted so deeply in who she was that the questions didn't shake her. I kept thinking \"I embody what matters beyond the retreat glow\" and it felt like she was saying \"yes, but do you know what matters yet?\"\n\nThe hardest part? Seeing my kids' faces when I'm physically there but mentally calculating my next move, thinking about my next meeting, my next whatever. The medicine made me sit in that disconnect until I couldn't breathe. All those times I told myself I was present... I wasn't. Not really.\n\nI don't have clean answers yet. Integration feels messier this time, but also more honest. Like I can't go back to pretending I don't know what I know now.",
  "system10": "That's the medicine working - showing you what you needed to see, not what you wanted to see.\n\nThe raw truth is the hardest to swallow, but it's what actually changes us. Everything else is just entertainment.\n\nYour intentions held. They guided you to exactly what you needed to face - the performance, the pursuit, the disconnect. The medicine didn't show you these things to break you. It showed you so you can choose differently.\n\nKeep living those intentions. They're not just pretty words anymore - they're what you know to be true now.\n\nWhat feels like the first step in being present with your kids today?",
  "user10": "The first step... I think it's putting my phone in a drawer when I get home. Not just face-down, but gone. Out of reach. I keep thinking about how my daughter asked me to watch her dance routine yesterday and I was nodding while scrolling through some board update that could've waited.\n\nTonight, when David brings them back from soccer practice, I'm going to sit on the floor. Actually sit down - no cooking, no tidying, no \"just checking one thing\" - and ask them about their day like their answers matter more than any investment decision I made this week. Because they do.\n\nMy grandmother used to say \"bentch licht\" when she lit candles - it means \"bless the light.\" I think that's what I need to do. Bless the small moments instead of always searching for the big ones to conquer.\n\nIt's funny - I spent years building companies that change the world, but I can't remember my son's favorite dinosaur right now. That's got to change.",
  "system11": "Start there.\n\nPhone in drawer. Floor. Ask about the dinosaur.\n\nThe small moments are where we actually build a life worth living. Everything else is just scaffolding.",
  "user11": "*builds a life worth living...*\n\nYeah. That's it, isn't it? I've been so focused on building legacies and empires that I forgot about building a Tuesday afternoon with my kids.\n\nPhone's going in the kitchen drawer the second I walk in. And I'm going to learn that dinosaur's name if it kills me.",
  "system12": "*small nod*\n\nThat's how you build a life worth living - one Tuesday afternoon at a time.\n\nThe dinosaur's name is waiting for you.",
  "user12": "*small smile*\n\nIt's probably some unpronounceable Latin thing that'll make me sound ridiculous saying it. But I'll learn it. And the next one, and the next.\n\nOne Tuesday at a time.",
  "system13": "Good.\n\nThe medicine did its work. Now you do yours.",
  "user13": "*nods slowly*\n\nThe real work was never in the ceremony. It was always in the coming home.",
  "system14": "Always is.\n\nThe journey back to your kitchen is where the medicine actually takes root.",
  "user14": "*quiet for a moment*\n\nMy kitchen feels like foreign territory sometimes. I know where every pan lives, but I don't know where my daughter keeps her favorite crayons. I can navigate a boardroom blindfolded, but I get lost trying to find where my son put his favorite hoodie.\n\nThe medicine showed me I've been a tourist in my own home. Time to learn the local customs.",
  "system15": "Then start being a local.\n\nAsk your daughter to show you her crayon spot. Let your son teach you his hoodie system.\n\nThey've been waiting to show you.",
  "user15": "*voice catching slightly*\n\nThey have been waiting, haven't they? All this time I've been searching for connection in retreats and ceremonies, and they've been right here with their crayon spots and hoodie systems.\n\nI think about how my grandmother knew everyone's favorite things. Not because she read about love in some book, but because she paid attention to the small details that make people feel seen.\n\nI've been so busy being impressive that I forgot how to be present.",
  "system16": "Your grandmother knew the secret:\n\nPresence impresses people who matter. The rest is just noise.\n\nTime to learn their favorite things.",
  "user16": "*quietly*\n\nShe did know that. She could make you feel like the most important person in the world just by really looking at you. Not checking her watch, not glancing at her phone\u2014just... being there.\n\nI've been chasing significance when what I needed was right here. My daughter's been trying to show me her crayon organization system for months. My son keeps talking about this hoodie that somehow has three different pockets.\n\nI need to stop being impressive and start being here.",
  "system17": "Then stop.\n\nBe here instead.\n\nThe crayon system and three-pocket hoodie are your teachers now.",
  "user17": "*small smile*\n\nThree-pocket hoodie. That sounds like exactly the kind of practical wisdom I need right now.\n\nOkay. I'm here. No more planning how to optimize family time or strategizing meaningful conversations. Just... showing up where they already are.\n\n*quietly*\n\nThank you. For reminding me that the most profound journey might be the one from my home office to their crayon spots.",
  "system18": "The journey from impressive to present.\n\nThat's the real medicine work.",
  "user18": "*softly*\n\nFrom impressive to present. From building empires to building Legos. From scaling companies to scaling myself down to fit into their world.\n\nMy grandmother would laugh\u2014she always said I was trying to build castles when what I needed was to learn how to sit on the floor.\n\nTime to practice the art of being small enough to enter their universe.",
  "system19": "Time to sit on the floor.\n\nLearn their universe by heart.",
  "user19": "*nods slowly*\n\nTime to sit on the floor and learn their universe by heart. No agenda, no objectives to hit, just... being small enough to fit in their world.\n\nI've been everywhere but here."
