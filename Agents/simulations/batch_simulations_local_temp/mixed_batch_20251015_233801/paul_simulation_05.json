  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help with... whatever's going on. I just need to sleep through the night without waking up yelling. Amanda's getting to the end of her rope with me.\n\nThree weeks and I'm doing this thing. Never touched anything like it before, but the guys running it seem solid. I trust them more than the VA, that's for sure.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without yelling\n2. Amanda staying instead of reaching her limit\n3. Trusting this new path when the VA failed\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that about sums it up. \n\nI guess the sleep thing, that's the worst part. Wake up drenched, heart racing, sometimes I don't even remember what the dream was about. Just know it was bad. Amanda says I grab her arm sometimes, like I'm still over there. I hate that I do that to her.\n\nShe's been talking about needing space lately. Says she can't keep walking on eggshells, waiting for me to snap. We've got the kids to think about - 11 and 14, they need their mom and dad together. I can't lose her, man. Can't lose this family I built.\n\nAnd this... plant medicine thing. I don't know. Doesn't feel like something I'd ever do, but what choice do I have? Therapy's for people who think they're broken. I'm not broken, just... tired. Real tired.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n2. I make our bed safe for Amanda again\n3. I release what keeps me fighting ghosts\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The bed one... that's it. That's what cuts deepest. Making it safe for her again.\n\nBut these words feel too soft. \"Release\" - I don't even know what that means. I need something stronger. What about \"I stop fighting enemies that aren't there\" or \"I learn when to stand down\"?\n\nAnd \"peacefully\" - that's not really what I'm after. I just want quiet. No thrashing around, no grabbing her, no shouting in the dark. Just... stillness.\n\nHow about \"I keep the war out of our bedroom\"? Something like that.",
  "system3": "\"I keep the war out of our bedroom\" - that's strong.\n\nHow about:\n\n1. I sleep quiet through the night\n2. I keep the war out of our bedroom\n3. I learn when to stand down\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that's better. That's more like it.\n\n\"I keep the war out of our bedroom\" - that's exactly right. That's what I need to do. Keep whatever's still following me from crawling into bed with us.\n\n\"I sleep quiet through the night\" - simple. Direct. No fancy words about peace or healing, just... quiet. That's all I want.\n\n\"I learn when to stand down\" - that's the hard one. Been standing at attention for fifteen years, even after I took the uniform off. Don't know how to not be ready for a fight. But I need to learn. For Amanda. For the kids.\n\nThese feel like orders I can follow. Clear missions.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep quiet through the night\n2. I keep the war out of our bedroom\n3. I learn when to stand down\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Roger that. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for... well, for making this feel like something I can actually do. Not some mystical crap, just three things I need to get done. Like any other mission.\n\nThree weeks. I'll be ready.",
  "system5": "Solid compass. The medicine will meet you where you are - no mystical needed.\n\nThree weeks. You've got this.",
  "user5": "Appreciate it. \n\nNever thought I'd be heading to Costa Rica to drink some plant brew, but here we are. Just need to get through this, come back, and be the man my family needs me to be. The man I know I still am, somewhere under all this... whatever this is.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system6": "The man's still there. The medicine just helps clear what got piled on top.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user6": "Yeah... yeah, maybe that's right. Maybe he's still in there somewhere.\n\nWe'll find out soon enough.",
  "system7": "He is.",

Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user12": "Look, I don't really know how to do this. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help me stop waking up screaming every night. Amanda\u2014my wife\u2014she's about had it with me. Says I scare the kids when I bolt upright like that. \n\nI guess I'm here because I can't lose my family. I've tried everything else.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up screaming at night\n2. Amanda feeling safe again \n3. Keep your family together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah. Those are... those are the things. I just don't know how to say it right. \n\nI mean, what do I even call it? It's not PTSD or anything like that. I just need to sleep through the night without... without whatever this is. Without making Amanda sleep on the couch because she's afraid I'll wake up swinging again.\n\nHow do I make this into whatever you call them\u2014intentions\u2014without sounding like I'm some broken mess?",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again\n3. I keep my family close\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user14": "The second one. That's the one. \"I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again.\"\n\nOnly... can we say it different? Stronger. Like a mission objective. Something I can actually do, not just hope for.\n\nWhat about \"I protect Amanda from my nightmares\" or \"I keep the war out of our bedroom\"? Something like that. Something that sounds like I'm handling it, not... I don't know... whimpering about it.",
  "system15": "\"I keep the war out of our bedroom\" - that's solid. Direct. Mission-focused.\n\nHow about:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I keep the war out of our bedroom\n3. I stay present with my family\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user15": "Yeah. Yeah, these work. These feel like something I can actually... do. Like orders I can follow.\n\nThe first one's still a little soft for me, but I get it. I need to sleep. The nightmares\u2014they're getting worse. Sometimes I see the cockpit lighting up with tracers and I can smell the jet fuel, and I'm back there. I need that to stop.\n\nThe second one\u2014that's exactly right. I need to keep that shit locked away where it belongs. Amanda didn't sign up for this. She deserves to feel safe in her own bed.\n\nAnd the third... that's the big one, isn't it? Not just physically there, but actually there. Not checking out when the kids are talking about their day. Not staring through the TV every night.\n\nThese are good. I can work with these.",
  "system16": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I keep the war out of our bedroom\n3. I stay present with my family\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user16": "Got it. I'll write these down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks until Costa Rica. Three weeks to get my head straight about this whole thing. \n\nThanks for helping me figure out how to say what I need without... you know. Without making it sound like I'm not handling my business.\n\nI'll see this through.",
  "system17": "Three weeks is good time. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them clear like this gives you direction.\n\nTrust what comes. You've got this.",
  "user17": "Yeah. We'll see. I'm not much for trusting anything I can't see or touch, but... I guess that's part of why I'm doing this, right?\n\nThree weeks. Then whatever happens happens.",
  "system18": "Exactly. The control you've had to hold tight for years - the medicine will show you how to let some of that go. Not all at once. Just enough.\n\nThree weeks. Then you find out what you're really made of when the war isn't calling the shots.",
  "user18": "When the war isn't calling the shots... hell of a thing to imagine. Been so long I don't even know what that feels like anymore.\n\nBut yeah. Three weeks. Time to find out who I am when I'm not just surviving.",
  "system19": "That's it. Three weeks to find the man underneath all that armor you've been wearing.\n\nKeep those intentions close. They'll remind you why you're doing this when it gets rough.",
  "user19": "Underneath the armor... right. That's the part that scares me. What's left when you strip all that away? What if there's not much there?\n\nI'll keep them close. Thanks."
