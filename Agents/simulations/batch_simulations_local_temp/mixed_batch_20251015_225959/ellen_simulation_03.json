  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your psychedelic journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For this medicine, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one cracked me open a little more, showed me pieces of what I'm missing. But I keep coming back to the same place\u2014like I'm collecting spiritual experiences but not really living them. \n\nI built this company, sold it before 40, checked every box... and none of it feels like mine anymore. My grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything, and I think I've lost that. I want to find my way back to something real, something that matters. But I'm terrified this is just another retreat where I'll feel connected for a week and then go back to grinding through my days.",
  "system1": "You've done the circuit - ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA - collecting pieces but not feeling them stick. The divine spark your grandmother spoke about feels distant while you're grinding through days that don't feel like yours.\n\nWhat's underneath the grinding? When you imagine days that feel truly yours, what would you be doing instead?",
  "user1": "I don't know... it's like I'm always performing. Even when I'm with my kids at the park, I'm thinking about board meetings or checking stock prices. The grinding feels like this constant hum of \"what's next, what's next\" that I can't turn off.\n\nWhen I picture days that feel like mine... it's simpler. I'm up early, but not to check emails\u2014to watch the sunrise maybe. I help my daughter with her art project without thinking about my phone. I have dinner with my husband and actually taste the food instead of mentally drafting investor updates. \n\nIt's pathetic, right? I built this incredible life and I can't even be present for it. My grandmother would wake up every morning and say this blessing about gratitude for having her soul returned to her overnight... and I wake up checking Slack before my feet hit the floor.",
  "system2": "That hum of \"what's next\" drowns out your daughter's art projects and sunrise. Your grandmother welcomed her soul back each morning while you check Slack before standing.\n\nWhat's underneath the performance? Who taught you your worth depends on producing and achieving?",
  "user2": "My dad built his way up from nothing\u2014immigrant parents, worked construction while getting his degree, started his own firm. Every dinner was about what we accomplished that day. My mom ran the PTA like a Fortune 500 company. Achievement was just... oxygen in our house. \n\nI remember being maybe seven and getting a B on a spelling test. My dad didn't get mad\u2014he just looked confused, like \"Ellen, you're so smart, what happened here?\" That look... I'd rather get screamed at than see that disappointment again.\n\nSo I learned to produce. Got into Stanford, built a company, sold it for more money than my family ever dreamed of. And when I handed my parents the check from the sale\u2014this enormous check that should've been the ultimate proof I was enough\u2014my mom just said \"What's next, sweetheart?\" \n\nI think I've been trying to answer that question ever since.",
  "system3": "That confusion on your dad's face when you got a B - it taught you that performing was survival. Your mom's \"what's next\" when you handed her that check proved it would never be enough.\n\nThe performance isn't serving you anymore. What's underneath wanting to be present for your daughter's art and sunrise? What part of you is still craving to be witnessed beyond your achievements?",
  "user3": "There's this part of me... when I'm hiking alone and the fog lifts off the hills, or when my daughter shows me this lopsided pottery thing she made with her tiny hands... I feel it. This quiet knowing that I'm more than what I produce. Like maybe I'm enough just breathing.\n\nMy grandmother saw it. She'd watch me practice piano and say \"You don't have to be perfect, bubeleh, you just have to let the music move through you.\" She saw something in me that wasn't about being the best. Just... being. \n\nI want that part to matter more than my quarterly returns or how many boards I sit on. I want to know what it feels like to wake up and not immediately calculate how to optimize the day. My kids deserve to know their mom beyond the woman checking her phone at their soccer games.\n\nBut honestly? I'm scared that part got buried too deep. What if I can't find it again?",
  "system4": "Your grandmother saw the part that lets music move through you without needing perfection. That part still shows up in hiking fog and your daughter's lopsided pottery - it's not buried, just waiting.\n\nThree main threads here:\n\n1. Moving from performance to presence - letting yourself be more than what you produce\n2. Reclaiming that \"enough just breathing\" feeling your grandmother recognized\n3. Showing your kids who you are beyond the phone at soccer games\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Okay... so how do we do this? I've set intentions before but they always feel like I'm writing a business plan for my soul. \"Be more present\" or \"Find my purpose\"\u2014they sound good but they don't actually change anything when I'm back in my real life, you know?\n\nI want something that sticks this time. Something that helps me recognize when I'm performing versus when I'm actually here. Because right now it's like I have this autopilot that just kicks in and suddenly I'm grinding again, even when I swore I wouldn't.",
  "system5": "Business plans for your soul don't work because they live in your head, not your body. You need something that interrupts the autopilot when it kicks in.\n\nHere are intentions that might actually stick:\n\n1. I recognize when I'm performing and gently return to being present with my breath\n2. I welcome the part of me that's enough just breathing, like my grandmother saw\n3. I embrace showing my children who I am beyond achievements\n\nWhich feels like it could interrupt the grind? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "The first one... that word \"gently\" hits me. I'm always so hard on myself when I catch myself performing, like I failed some test. But \"gently return\"\u2014that's something I could actually practice.\n\nCan we make it more specific though? Like... instead of just \"being present with my breath\" maybe something about noticing the actual moment? Like when I'm reaching for my phone at the park, I can feel my daughter's hand in mine instead?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I recognize when I'm performing and gently return to feeling my daughter's hand in mine\"\n\nThat specificity will catch you in the moment. Your daughter's small hand becomes your anchor.\n\nHow do the other two land for you?",
  "user6": "The second one about being enough just breathing... I want to say yes to it, but there's this part of me that feels like it's too simple. Like I should be reaching for something bigger, more transformative. \n\nBut maybe that's the point, right? That my grandmother saw something so basic and true that I keep missing it while I'm chasing these complex insights.\n\nCan we add something about her specifically? Like remembering how she saw me?",
  "system7": "You keep chasing complexity while your grandmother saw the simple truth you keep missing. That's exactly the point.\n\nRevised: \"I welcome being enough just breathing, as my grandmother saw before I started performing\"\n\nDoes that capture her witness to your enough-ness?",
  "user7": "Yeah... that actually makes me want to cry a little. She really did see that part of me before I even knew I was performing. Before I knew there was any other way to be.\n\nAnd the third one... about my kids. I want them to know me beyond the achievements, but I don't want to make it about them somehow. Like I don't want it to become another performance of being a \"good mom,\" you know? \n\nMaybe it's more about me being real with them? Showing them when I'm struggling, when I'm happy, when I'm just... human?",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I welcome being enough just breathing, as my grandmother saw before I even knew I was performing\"\n\nThat tears response tells us we hit the truth.\n\nFor the third - yes, showing them your humanity rather than performing \"good mom.\" How about: \"I embrace being real with my children - showing them my struggles, joy, and humanity beyond achievements\"",
  "user8": "Yes... that's it. Being real instead of perfect. They don't need me to be some idealized version - they need to see what it looks like to be human and still be enough.\n\nSo let me make sure I have these right:\n\n1. I recognize when I'm performing and gently return to feeling my daughter's hand in mine\n2. I welcome being enough just breathing, as my grandmother saw before I even knew I was performing  \n3. I embrace being real with my children - showing them my struggles, joy, and humanity beyond achievements\n\nThese feel... different. Like they might actually work in my real messy life, not just sound good on paper.",
  "system9": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I embrace being real with my children - showing them my struggles, joy, and humanity beyond achievements\"\n\nYou've got three intentions that live in your body, not on paper. Your daughter's hand, your grandmother's witness, your realness with your kids - these will catch you in the moment.\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Some options: write them on your mirror where you brush teeth with your kids, keep them in your hiking pack, or read them when you first wake up before checking your phone.\n\nWhat would help you remember when the autopilot tries to kick in?",
  "user9": "The mirror thing feels like it would become another thing I'm performing - like \"look kids, mommy's being mindful!\" \n\nBut the hiking pack... that's where I feel most like myself. And those 5:30am moments before I grab my phone - that's when I'm most raw and real.\n\nI'll write them on a small card and keep it in my hiking pack, and maybe read them when I'm making coffee before I check anything. Just... quietly, before the day starts performing for anyone.",
  "system10": "Perfect. Quiet, before the world starts demanding performances.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n1. I recognize when I'm performing and gently return to feeling my daughter's hand in mine\n2. I welcome being enough just breathing, as my grandmother saw before I even knew I was performing  \n3. I embrace being real with my children - showing them my struggles, joy, and humanity beyond achievements\n\nYour ritual: Keep the card in your hiking pack, read them with your morning coffee before touching your phone. Let those 5:30am moments anchor you.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.",
  "user10": "Thank you. These feel... possible. Like I can actually carry them into this journey and back out again.\n\nI've been so worried about getting this \"right\" - the perfect intentions, the perfect integration plan. But these... they're just about being human. Being real. Being enough.\n\nI think I'm ready now.",
  "system11": "You are ready. The perfect intentions were never the point - being real was. Trust what comes.",
  "user11": "I will. And... thank you for seeing through all my overthinking to what actually matters. I needed this more than I realized.",
  "system12": "I hear you. Go well.",
  "user12": "...\n\nI will. See you on the other side.",
  "system13": "See you on the other side.",
  "user13": "See you on the other side.",
  "system14": "See you on the other side.",
  "user14": "See you on the other side.",
  "system15": "See you on the other side.",

  "system17": "See you on the other side.",
  "user17": "See you on the other side.",
  "system18": "See you on the other side.",
  "user18": "See you on the other side.",
  "system19": "I'm starting intentions onboarding for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user19": "I guess I\u2019m here because the old playbook stopped working. I built and sold my company, hit every milestone I was supposed to want, and instead of feeling proud I felt\u2026 hollow. I\u2019ve sat with ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA\u2014each showed me flashes of what matters: service, family, spirit. But the minute I\u2019m back on a board call or scrolling Crunchbase at 5 a.m., the glow fades and I\u2019m restless again. I\u2019m tired of collecting wins that don\u2019t add up to meaning. I need something that actually sticks."
