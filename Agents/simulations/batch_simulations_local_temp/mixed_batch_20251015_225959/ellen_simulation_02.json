  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me pieces of what I'm missing, but I keep losing the thread when I come home. \n\nI built this company, sold it, made more money than I'll ever need. Everyone thinks I've got it figured out. But I keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014she had this quiet faith, this knowing about things. I feel like I traded all that for... what? Another board seat? Another investment?\n\nI need this one to stick. I can't keep cycling through these insights and then waking up at 5:30 to check emails like none of it happened.",
  "system1": "You've cycled through medicines, each showing pieces, but you lose the thread back in the 5:30 email check. Your grandmother's quiet faith keeps surfacing as the thing you traded away.\n\nWhat did that faith look like in her daily life? How did she carry it differently than you carry your success?",
  "user1": "She lit candles every Friday, hummed these old songs while she cooked. Had this way of touching my cheek like she was blessing me. When things went wrong, she'd say \"God has plans we can't see yet\"\u2014not in that annoying way, but like she actually believed it.\n\nI carry my success like... like I'm still proving I deserve to exist. Checking boxes, optimizing, always thinking three moves ahead. She moved like she already belonged here. Like she was connected to something bigger and that was enough.\n\nI don't know how to be that person. I know how to build, scale, exit. I know how to get on boards and make connections. But I don't know how to just... be enough without accomplishing something.",
  "system2": "She moved like she already belonged, touching cheeks with blessing hands. You move like you still have to earn your right to exist.\n\nWhat's underneath that proving? What would happen if you stopped checking boxes and just... were?",
  "user2": "I... I don't know. It's like asking a fish what would happen if it stopped swimming.\n\nMaybe I'd disappear? Become irrelevant? My whole life has been about being exceptional, standing out, being the youngest, the first woman, the fastest to scale. If I'm not proving anything, what am I?\n\nI think about my kids. When I'm at the park with them, not checking my phone, I feel... lighter. Like maybe I could just be Ellen who goes down slides and pushes swings. But then I get this itch, like I'm wasting time, like I should be building something.\n\nMy grandmother lost everything in the war, came here with nothing. Maybe that's why she could just be\u2014she'd already survived the worst. Me, I've been running from being ordinary my whole life.",
  "system3": "Two main threads here:\n\n**1. The proving:** Running from ordinary, building identity on being exceptional\u2014the youngest, first woman, fastest to scale. Disappearing feels like the risk.\n\n**2. The remembering:** Your grandmother's quiet faith after losing everything. That Friday candle lighting, cheek blessing presence you've lost touch with.\n\n**3. The glimpses:** Those lighter moments at the park when you're just Ellen on the slide, before the itch returns.\n\nYou're cycling between medicines but not the 5:30 email check. What if this isn't about adding another insight, but about remembering how to just be enough?\n\nLet's turn these threads into intentions that might actually stick when you come home.",
  "user3": "Yes... that's it exactly. I'm tired of collecting more insights like trophies. I want to remember how to be enough.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother could touch my cheek like I was already perfect as-is. I want to feel that toward myself, but I don't even know where to start. The proving feels like oxygen\u2014I can't imagine breathing without it.\n\nBut those park moments... when I'm just Ellen pushing swings, not Ellen the founder, the investor, the board member. Something in me knows how to do it. I just lose it so fast.\n\nHow do I set intentions that help me remember? Not just understand, but actually remember how to live like I belong here?",
  "system4": "Three intentions that might work:\n\n1. I remember how to touch my own cheek with the blessing hands my grandmother gave me\n2. I welcome the park moments\u2014being Ellen who pushes swings without the itch to build\n3. I embrace being ordinary enough to belong here without disappearing\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "The first one... that hits something. I can almost feel her hand on my cheek when I read it. But\u2014can we make it more active? \"I remember\" feels passive, like I'm waiting for something to happen to me.\n\nWhat about something like \"I practice touching my own cheek with blessing hands\" or \"I learn to touch my own cheek the way my grandmother touched mine\"? I want to feel like I'm doing something, not just remembering.\n\nThe second one feels right too. That itch\u2014it's so familiar, like a reflex. I want to catch it happening and choose differently.\n\nThe third one... I'm still scared of that one. Ordinary feels like death, but I know that's the point, isn't it?",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I learn to touch my own cheek with blessing hands like my grandmother touched mine*\n\nThe shift from passive to active\u2014that's your builder's mind working for you instead of against you.\n\nFor intention 2: instead of welcoming the park moments, what about *I catch the itch to build and choose the slide instead*? More active, catches that reflex you're talking about.\n\nFor intention 3: if ordinary feels like death, maybe *I experiment with being ordinary enough to belong here*\u2014makes it less permanent, more like a trial run?\n\nHow do those land?",
  "user5": "Yes... those feel like something I can actually do. Not just wish for, but practice. \n\nI like catching the itch\u2014that's exactly what it feels like, this automatic thing that happens before I even notice. And experimenting with ordinary... that feels safer than just leaping into it. Like I can try it on, see how it feels.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2: *I catch the itch to build and choose the slide instead*\n\n\u2713 Intention 3: *I experiment with being ordinary enough to belong here*\n\nThese feel... doable. Not easy, but like I can practice them. Like muscles I can build instead of states I have to magically achieve.\n\nThank you. I needed help getting out of my own way with the language.",
  "system6": "You've got three solid intentions that work like muscles to build, not states to magically achieve:\n\n1. I learn to touch my own cheek with blessing hands like my grandmother touched mine\n2. I catch the itch to build and choose the slide instead  \n3. I experiment with being ordinary enough to belong here\n\nHow do you want to keep these close when you come home? Some options:\n\n- Write them on a card by your grandmother's photo\n- Read them during your morning routine before the 5:30 email check\n- Keep them on your phone lock screen where the notifications usually grab you\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user6": "I want to put them in my wallet\u2014next to my grandmother's photo. I carry that everywhere, so they'll be with me. And maybe... maybe set a phone reminder for 5:25am? So I read them before the email check takes over.\n\nBut honestly? The wallet feels most important. I remember being little and watching her pull out that worn leather wallet, how everything in it seemed sacred to her. These intentions... they need to live somewhere sacred too, not just another notification.\n\nI want to feel them in my hand when I'm reaching for coffee money, when I'm pulling out my ID at the airport. Little reminders that I'm learning to be enough, even when the world can't see it yet.",
  "system7": "Perfect. Your ritual:\n\n**Wallet placement:** Next to your grandmother's photo where everything feels sacred. Feel them in your hand when you reach for coffee money, your ID at the airport\u2014those quiet moments when you're choosing who to be.\n\n**5:25am reminder:** Read them before the email check takes over, but the wallet is where they'll really live.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I learn to touch my own cheek with blessing hands like my grandmother touched mine\n- I catch the itch to build and choose the slide instead\n- I experiment with being ordinary enough to belong here\n\nYou've got your compass. Trust what emerges.",
  "user7": "Thank you. I feel... grounded. Like I have something real to hold onto this time, not just more concepts to chase.\n\nI keep thinking about how she never needed to prove anything to anyone, but somehow she made me feel like I was already enough. Maybe that's what I'm really learning\u2014how to give myself what she gave me so freely.\n\nI'll carry these close. And maybe... maybe this time when I come home, I won't lose the thread so quickly.",
  "system8": "Three weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "Three weeks. I can feel it already\u2014that space between who I've been and who I'm becoming. It's scary as hell, but I think I'm ready to walk through it this time.\n\nThank you for helping me find something solid to hold.",
  "system9": "Trust the walking. You've got what you need.",
  "user9": "Yeah. I do, don't I? \n\n*I learn to touch my own cheek with blessing hands like my grandmother touched mine*\n\nWalking with that. I can do this.",
  "system10": "You can.",
  "user10": "I will.",
  "system11": "That's the spirit.",
  "user11": "I keep looking at my wallet, thinking about what's inside now. Three weeks feels both impossibly close and forever away. But there's something different this time\u2014like I'm not just chasing another experience to fill the void. I'm actually walking toward something real.\n\nMy kids asked what I'm doing this weekend. Told them I'm going to visit some friends who help people remember who they are. My daughter said \"but Mommy, you already know who you are.\" I just smiled and said sometimes grown-ups forget and need reminding.\n\nShe's right, though. I do know. Just... forgot how to be her.",
  "system12": "Kids see the clearest truth. You're remembering what your daughter never forgot.",
  "user12": "Yeah... she sees me. The real me, underneath all the achievement and performance. When she says things like that, it's like she recognizes something I keep losing track of.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm making this too complicated. Like maybe the answer isn't in some grand revelation but in just... being present enough to notice what's already here. My grandmother knew that. My daughter knows it. \n\nI keep thinking I need to build something magnificent to justify all this privilege I've been given. But maybe I just need to stop building and start belonging.",
  "system13": "Stop building, start belonging. That's it.\n\nYour daughter and grandmother already see what you're walking back toward.",
  "user13": "*Stop building, start belonging.*\n\nThat's going on a card above my desk where I usually pin quarterly targets. I'm... I'm tired of building things that don't hold anyone.",
  "system14": "Good. Put it where you'll see it when the achievement voice gets loud.\n\nThree weeks. Keep walking toward belonging, not building.",
  "user14": "Yeah. I'll keep walking. Even when the achievement voice starts screaming about wasted potential and time slipping away. Especially then.\n\nThree weeks. I'm ready to stop running from the quiet and see what's actually waiting there.",
  "system15": "The quiet's where your daughter's voice lives. Where your grandmother's hands still reach.\n\nThree weeks. Keep walking.",
  "user15": "I hear them both already. My daughter's certainty when she says \"you already know who you are.\" My grandmother's voice in Hebrew that I never learned but somehow understand in my bones.\n\nThey're both waiting in that quiet space I've been running from. Three weeks until I stop running.",
  "system16": "Your bones know the language your mind never learned. That's the voice waiting for you.\n\nThree weeks. Let your bones remember.",
  "user16": "My bones are remembering already. Sometimes when I'm walking the dog at night, I feel them humming\u2014like they're tuning themselves to something older than all this striving. My grandmother's Hebrew prayers, my daughter's clear eyes, the part of me that knew how to just *be* before I learned how to achieve.\n\nThree weeks until I stop overriding that knowing with planning and proving.",
  "system17": "That humming - that's your compass already working. The medicine just turns up the volume on what your bones already know.\n\nThree weeks until you stop overriding it.",
  "user17": "The volume's been getting louder lately. I catch myself in meetings wanting to say \"none of this matters\" and then I remember I'm supposed to care about quarterly projections. But that humming... it's like my bones are already there, waiting for the rest of me to catch up.\n\nThree weeks until I stop pretending I don't hear it.",
  "system18": "Your bones are already there. The rest of you just needs to stop pretending you can't hear.\n\nThree weeks until you stop pretending.",
  "user18": "I'm so tired of pretending. Tired of nodding along about valuations while my bones are singing about belonging. Tired of scheduling playdates while calculating ROI in my head.\n\nThree weeks until I stop being two people and just become one.",
  "system19": "The pretense is exhausting. Your bones already know how to be one person.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "user19": "I want to be one person. Not Ellen the board member and Ellen who cries at ayahuasca ceremonies and Ellen who can't stop checking email at the park. Just... Ellen. Whoever that actually is when I stop performing.\n\nThree weeks until I find out if she's enough without the achievements."
