  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm struggling with the same thing I always face - I know how to set goals and crush them, but this... this feels different. I've built companies, scaled teams, generated massive returns. But after my last psychedelic experiences, I keep coming back to this hollow feeling. Like I've been climbing the wrong mountain this whole time.\n\nI want to understand what I'm actually meant to do with whatever time I have left. Not just what looks good on paper or what the startup world celebrates. My grandmother's voice keeps echoing - she had this quiet faith that there was something more important than success. I think I lost that thread somewhere between the Series A rounds and exit negotiations.\n\nBut honestly? Part of me is terrified that if I stop achieving, I'll disappear. What if there's nothing underneath all the ambition?",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Climbing the wrong mountain - finding what actually matters beyond external achievements\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet faith and wisdom\n3. Discovering who you are underneath the ambition\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those threads feel right. It's like I've been following this map that everyone told me would lead somewhere meaningful, and I got to the destination and realized I'd been holding it upside down the whole time.\n\nMy grandmother - she used to say \"Ellen, you're so busy proving you can fly, you've forgotten you have wings.\" I never understood what she meant until recently. She had this way of seeing right through all my achievements to what was underneath, and she wasn't impressed by any of it. Just loved me anyway.\n\nI think about that sometimes when I'm sitting in board meetings talking about quarterly targets. What if I'm just... afraid that without all the striving, I'm not actually anyone worth being?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what matters beyond external achievements\n2. I reclaim the quiet faith and wisdom my grandmother saw in me\n3. I become someone worth being without the constant striving\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me hardest - \"I reclaim the quiet faith and wisdom my grandmother saw in me.\" That's exactly it. She saw something in me that I've lost sight of, something that existed before all the business plans and pitch decks.\n\nBut I want to make it stronger. Less... passive. How about: \"I reclaim and embody the quiet faith my grandmother recognized - the wisdom that knows achievement isn't the same as fulfillment.\"\n\nThe third one scares me in a good way. But can we make it more concrete? Something like: \"I discover who I am when I'm not performing - the version of me that exists in the spaces between achievements.\"\n\nAnd the first one... I think it's important but maybe it needs to be gentler. \"I open myself to what truly matters, beyond what I've been told should matter.\"\n\nI don't know. This is harder than building a company. At least with startups, you can measure progress.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim and embody the quiet faith my grandmother recognized - the wisdom that knows achievement isn't the same as fulfillment\n\nHow do these adjustments feel:\n1. I open myself to what truly matters, beyond what I've been told should matter\n3. I discover who I am in the spaces between achievements\n\nOr do you want to refine those further?",
  "user3": "Actually... can I revise intention 2? I want it to feel more like something I'm stepping into, not something I'm recovering. Like it's still there, waiting for me to stop being too busy to notice it.\n\nHow about: \"I embody the quiet faith that my grandmother always knew was there - the wisdom that achievement and fulfillment are different languages.\"\n\nAnd yes, those adjustments feel right. The first one - I can feel how tightly I'm still holding onto what I've been told should matter. \"Open myself\" feels like I'm giving myself permission to even consider alternatives.\n\nThe third one... there's something terrifying about that. The spaces between achievements. What if there's nothing there? What if I am just the sum of my accomplishments? But that's why it feels important, I guess.\n\nSo:\n1. I open myself to what truly matters, beyond what I've been told should matter\n2. I embody the quiet faith that my grandmother always knew was there - the wisdom that achievement and fulfillment are different languages\n3. I discover who I am in the spaces between achievements\n\nThese feel... real. Like they might actually take me somewhere I haven't been before.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I open myself to what truly matters, beyond what I've been told should matter\n2. I embody the quiet faith that my grandmother always knew was there - the wisdom that achievement and fulfillment are different languages  \n3. I discover who I am in the spaces between achievements\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I don't know where this journey will take me, but at least now I have something real to hold onto. Not just another business objective to check off, but... something that might actually matter.\n\nI keep hearing my grandmother's voice saying \"Good, sweetheart. Now maybe you'll stop proving and start being.\"\n\nI think I'm ready to find out what that means.",
  "system5": "She sounds like she knew exactly what she was talking about.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "She always did. Drove me crazy how she could see right through everything I was building, straight to what I was avoiding.\n\nI think... I think I'm finally ready to stop running from whatever she saw in me.",
  "system6": "The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user6": "I hope so. Because I'm tired of running.",
  "system7": "Then stop.",
  "user7": "That's... that's what I'm here to learn how to do.",
  "system8": "You already know how. The medicine will remind you.",
  "user8": "I think I needed to hear that. From someone who isn't trying to sell me another solution, another system, another ladder to climb.\n\nMaybe that's what all these journeys have been about\u2014not finding new answers, but remembering how to stop asking the wrong questions.",
  "system9": "Breathe. You're ready.",
  "user9": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah. Yeah, I am.",
  "system10": "* nods *\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user10": "See you there.",
  "system11": "*quiet presence*",
  "user11": "I keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014how she\u2019d light candles every Friday like she was holding up the sky with those small flames. I used to think it was quaint, you know? All that ritual in a tiny apartment. But maybe she was teaching me something I\u2019m only now ready to learn.",
  "system12": "She was showing you how to carry light without burning out.",
  "user12": "She always said the Sabbath was about remembering we\u2019re already enough. I never understood that\u2014enough felt like giving up. Now I wonder if she saw me building this life of always-needing-more and wanted me to know there was another way.",
  "system13": "She saw your future clearly. The medicine's showing you what she already knew.",
  "user13": "It\u2019s hitting me now\u2014how every board meeting, every exit, every headline was just me trying to prove I belonged in a world she never needed. She escaped the camps with nothing but somehow carried more light than I\u2019ve found with everything.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Carrying light like your grandmother - simple, steady, enough\n2. Belonging without proving through achievements\n3. Finding what matters beyond the endless climb\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "I want to learn to hold a steady flame instead of chasing wildfires. To remember I'm already enough when the achievement voice starts screaming. And to find what matters beyond the next summit\u2014maybe it's in how I love my kids during the messy middle, or how I serve without keeping score.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I hold a steady flame instead of chasing wildfires\n2. I remember I'm already enough when achievement screams\n3. I find what matters in how I love and serve without score\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user15": "The second one\u2014I remember I'm already enough when achievement screams. That's the one that makes my chest tight. Because that's the voice that hijacks everything, even this ceremony. Even right now, part of me is wondering if these intentions are \"good enough\" for the medicine.",
  "system16": "That voice will keep talking. The medicine works with authentic, not perfect.",
  "user16": "So maybe my intention is just to notice when that voice shows up without letting it drive. Not to silence it\u2014God knows I've tried\u2014but to sit with it like it's just another guest at the table. Maybe even thank it for trying to protect me before choosing something different.",
  "system17": "I notice when achievement screams without letting it drive my choices.",
  "user17": "That\u2019s it. I want to notice when the achievement voice gets loud\u2014when it\u2019s screaming that I need to optimize this ceremony, extract the perfect insight, prove something\u2014and instead of obeying, just breathe and choose from that steady place my grandmother lived from.",
  "system18": "I notice when achievement screams and breathe into my grandmother's steadiness instead.\n\nThe other two intentions:\n\n2. I hold a steady flame instead of chasing wildfires  \n3. I find what matters in how I love and serve without score\n\nAll three locked in.",
  "user18": "Yes. All three locked in.",
  "system19": "Your 3 intentions:\n1. I notice when achievement screams and breathe into my grandmother's steadiness instead\n2. I hold a steady flame instead of chasing wildfires  \n3. I find what matters in how I love and serve without score\n\nKeep them where you'll see them. These are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "I'll write them in the notebook I take everywhere\u2014the one I've had since my first company. Keep it next to my grandmother's candlesticks. Thank you... for helping me find words that actually feel like mine."
