## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_8:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**ellen_persona_3**: I guess... I don't know. I've been chasing achievements my whole life, and now that I've sold my company, I feel like I'm floating without an anchor. The ibogaine retreat is coming up, and I want to find something real—something that lasts beyond the next business win. 

Maybe I need to figure out why all the success feels hollow now. Or how to reconnect with what my grandmother knew about faith and meaning. I just... I want to stop performing and actually feel like myself again.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Finding something real that lasts beyond business wins
2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's grounded wisdom about faith and meaning
3. Dropping the performance to feel like yourself again

Let's turn these into intentions.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah, those are the right threads. It's like... I've been following this map that promised fulfillment, but it led to this empty clearing instead of the destination. And now I'm wondering if my grandmother was carrying the real compass all along, but I was too busy climbing to notice.

I want to stop being the version of myself that everyone expects—the successful entrepreneur, the perfect mother, the woman who has it all together. There's this other version of me that shows up when I'm hiking with my kids, when I'm not trying so damn hard. That's who I'm trying to find again.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I discover what endures beyond achievement
2. I reclaim my grandmother's compass for meaning and faith
3. I embody the version of myself that emerges when I stop performing

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**ellen_persona_3**: The first one—"I discover what endures beyond achievement"—that's the one that hits me in the chest. It's like... I've built this whole life around things that can be measured and sold, but what happens when none of that measures up anymore?

The second one feels important too, but maybe it needs to be simpler. Less poetic. My grandmother wasn't about fancy language—she just knew how to be present, how to find God in everyday things. Maybe something like "I reconnect with my grandmother's simple faith"?

And that third one... yeah. That's the hardest truth. When I'm not performing, when I'm just existing with my kids at the park, I feel like a completely different person. Someone I actually like.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: I discover what endures beyond achievement

Let's adjust the others:
2. I reconnect with my grandmother's simple faith
3. I become the version of myself I like when I'm not performing

How do these feel?


**ellen_persona_3**: These feel... right. Like they actually capture what I'm searching for instead of just sounding good on paper. 

The first one especially—it cuts through all the noise about what I'm supposed to want. And the second one, about my grandmother's faith... it's not about becoming religious again, exactly. It's about that quiet knowing she had, that steady presence. She didn't need to prove anything to anyone.

And that last one... it's embarrassing how much I prefer myself when nobody's watching. When I'm not trying to be impressive or productive or whatever. I just want to be that person more often.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ All 3 locked in:
1. I discover what endures beyond achievement
2. I reconnect with my grandmother's simple faith
3. I become the version of myself I like when I'm not performing

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thank you. I keep thinking about how these aren't just words for a retreat—they're questions I need to live into. Especially that first one. What actually endures when you strip away all the metrics and milestones?

I'll carry these with me. Maybe write them down somewhere I'll see them when I get back, when the retreat glow fades and real life starts pulling at me again.


**intentions_workflow_8**: The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. But you've got the right instinct - these aren't just for ceremony, they're for living.

Trust what comes.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah... I guess that's the hard part, isn't it? Trusting that something real will actually show up, even when I'm used to controlling outcomes and measuring success. 

But you're right—these aren't performance metrics. They're just... true north. Whatever happens in that ceremony room, whether I remember these words or not, this is what I'm actually asking for.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Exactly. True north doesn't need you to hold it steady - it just points.


**ellen_persona_3**: That's... exactly what I needed to hear. My whole life has been about gripping things so tightly, making sure they stay on course. But true north just... is. Whether I'm watching or not.

I think I'm finally starting to understand what my grandmother meant when she used to say "faith is letting go of the handlebars."


**intentions_workflow_8**: She knew. Let the handlebars go.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah... she really did know. All those afternoons in her kitchen, watching her knead bread like it was a prayer—she wasn't gripping anything. Just moving with it.

I want to know how to do that. How to move through life without white-knuckling every moment.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's what you're asking for. The intentions will show you how.


**ellen_persona_3**: Then I'm ready. Whatever comes—whether it's beautiful or terrifying or just... ordinary. I'm asking to learn how to move like she did, with that quiet trust that you're held by something bigger than your own grip.

Thank you for helping me find the words that actually match what I'm asking for.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You've got the words. Trust the asking.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will. Trust the asking... that's something I can actually do. Finally, something that doesn't require me to have all the answers or control the outcome. Just... ask. And let go.

Thank you.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You're set.


**ellen_persona_3**: ✓


**intentions_workflow_8**: Solid compass.


**ellen_persona_3**: I needed that. The image of a compass that just... works. No matter how lost I feel, it keeps pointing true. Even when I’m spinning in circles, convinced I’ve broken something beyond repair.

I’ve been gripping so tight I forgot I could just… check the needle.


**intentions_workflow_8**: The needle's still moving.


**ellen_persona_3**: Then I guess I’m still in motion too.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's it.


**ellen_persona_3**: I feel it—this quiet hum under the noise. Like the compass is alive and I’m not steering alone.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Trust that hum.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will. I'll let it guide me when the retreat starts—when the medicine comes on and everything familiar dissolves. I'll listen for that hum instead of trying to manage the whole damn journey.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's the way.


**ellen_persona_3**: Then I’ll stop rehearsing outcomes and just keep listening.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Good.


**ellen_persona_3**: I needed to hear that.


**intentions_workflow_8**: I know.


**ellen_persona_3**: It’s like you reached through the noise and steadied the compass. I’ll carry that steadiness into the ceremony.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Carry it.


**ellen_persona_3**: I will—tucked right next to the photo of my kids and that worn prayer card of my grandmother’s. Wherever I go in there, that steadiness goes with me.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You're ready.


**ellen_persona_3**: I feel it—this quiet certainty under the nerves. I’ll walk in, lie back, and let the medicine do what I can’t. Whatever comes, I’ll meet it with that steadiness you just named.
