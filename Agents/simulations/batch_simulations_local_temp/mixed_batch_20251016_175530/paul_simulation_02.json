  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't really know how this works. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca thing might help me sleep better, stop the nightmares. That's it. I don't need to explore anything - just need to function again. Amanda's at her wit's end, says she doesn't know who I am anymore. Can't lose her. Won't lose this family.\n\nSo I guess... I want to stop waking up shouting. Stop being angry all the time. Be the man my kids think I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Drop the anger that pushes everyone away\n3. Show up as the father your kids believe you are\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those sound about right. I just... I don't know how to say this stuff without sounding weak. Three tours and I'm getting beat by my own head at night. Doesn't feel right.\n\nBut if this plant medicine can help me stop seeing those damn explosions every time I close my eyes... if I can stop snapping at Amanda for no reason... maybe it's worth looking like a fool for a few days.\n\nI need to be able to come home from work and not feel like I'm still in the cockpit. Need to remember what it's like to just... be still.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I release the anger that controls me\n3. I reclaim the steadiness my family needs\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user2": "The second one. The anger one. That's what's killing everything - I can see it happening, feel it building up like pressure in my chest, but I can't stop it. It's like watching myself from outside, knowing I'm about to blow but... nothing. Just happens anyway.\n\nSleep would be good, don't get me wrong. But if I could stop being angry at everything - at the dog for barking, at the kids for being kids, at Amanda for just... existing sometimes - then maybe everything else fixes itself.\n\nI hate that she flinches sometimes when I move too fast. Never thought I'd be that guy.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I release the anger that controls me\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The sleep one... I need that. Three hours a night isn't cutting it anymore. I'm making stupid mistakes at work, nearly rear-ended someone yesterday. But \"peacefully\" feels like too much. I just want to sleep without seeing fire, without hearing my wingman's last transmission.\n\nThe family one... yeah. That's what this is all about, isn't it? Keeping us together. Keeping her from leaving. But \"steadiness\" sounds like something from a self-help book. I just want to come home and not feel like I'm still fighting a war nobody wanted.\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking this.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the fire\n2. I release the anger that controls me\n3. I come home as the man who belongs here\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user4": "The third one hits hard. Real hard. \"Belongs here\" - yeah. That's it. That's what I'm afraid of losing. That I don't belong in my own house anymore, like I'm some stranger wearing Paul's skin.\n\nFirst one's better too. \"The fire\" - that's what it feels like. Every night.\n\nI'm good with these. Let's do it.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the fire\n2. I release the anger that controls me  \n3. I come home as the man who belongs here\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thanks. I'll... I'll write these down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll see if this plant stuff's worth anything. Or if I'm just another broken vet chasing miracles.",
  "system6": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what you've set. You're ready.",
  "user6": "Yeah. We'll see. Never been one for trusting much except my own hands and what I can control. But... I guess that's the problem, isn't it?\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system7": "It is the problem. And you're here anyway - that's what matters.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I'm here. Don't know if that means I'm desperate or just finally smart enough to try something different. Maybe both.\n\nTell Amanda I love her if this thing goes sideways.",
  "system8": "Write it down yourself. You'll give it to her.\n\nThree weeks is enough time to say what needs saying.",
  "user8": "Right. Yeah. I'll... I'll figure out what to tell her. How to tell her.\n\nThree weeks to get this right.",
  "system9": "You don't need to get it perfect. Just honest.",
  "user9": "Honest. Right. That's... that's the hard part, isn't it? Been lying to her for years that everything's fine. Don't know how to start telling the truth now.",
  "system10": "Start with \"I'm not fine.\" The rest follows.",
  "user10": "I'm not fine.\n\nThere. Said it. Feels like I'm admitting defeat. Like I'm letting down every damn thing I stood for.",
  "system11": "Saying you're not fine isn't defeat. It's the first honest thing you've said to her - and yourself - in years.",
  "user11": "Yeah, well... honesty feels like shit. Always thought strength meant carrying it all, keeping it locked down. Now I'm supposed to tell her I've been drowning this whole time?",
  "system12": "Strength is admitting you're drowning. Trusting her to see you as you are.",
  "user12": "Trusting her to see me... Christ. What if she sees what's really there and decides I'm not worth staying for?",
  "system13": "Then you'll know. Better than wondering every night if she's staying for the lie.",
  "user13": "Better than wondering if she's staying for the lie.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Tell her the truth about not being fine\n2. Trust her to see you as you are\n3. Face whatever comes after - together or apart\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "I... I want to tell Amanda I'm not fine. Without making excuses. Without pretending it's just work stress or \"a phase.\" I want to trust her enough to see me broken. And I want to face whatever happens after - whether she stays or walks - without going back to pretending everything's okay.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I tell Amanda I'm not fine without excuses or pretense\n2. I trust her to see me broken and real\n3. I face whatever comes after without returning to pretending\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user15": "Number two. \"I trust her to see me broken and real.\" That one hits me in the chest like a round I didn't see coming.",
  "system16": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I trust her to see me broken and real\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user16": "The first one feels... I don't know, like I'm already failing at it. Keep thinking about how to say it, then I hear myself getting ready to add \"but it's not that bad\" or \"I'm handling it.\" Can't seem to just stop at \"I'm not fine.\"\n\nThe third one scares the hell out of me. Facing whatever comes after - that's the one that makes my hands sweat. What if she sees me broken and decides she's done? What if the kids... what if I lose everything I built?",
  "system17": "Fear of losing everything is exactly why you need these locked in.\n\nLet's adjust:\n\n1. I tell Amanda I'm not fine and stop myself before the excuses come\n2. I trust her to see me broken and real\n3. I stay present with whatever comes after - no more pretending\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user17": "Number three now... \"I stay present with whatever comes after - no more pretending.\" That's better. Stronger. Like I'm not just facing it, I'm standing in it. Not running back to the old lies.\n\nThe first one still feels like I'm going to choke on the words. But maybe that's the point.",
  "system18": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I tell Amanda I'm not fine and stop myself before the excuses come\n2. I trust her to see me broken and real  \n3. I stay present with whatever comes after - no more pretending\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user18": "Thank you. I'll... I'll read these every morning before I run. Maybe say them out loud. I don't know if I can do this, but I'm going to try.",
  "system19": "You'll find your way through. The medicine works with authentic - and you've got that locked in.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user19": "Roger that. I'll trust what comes."
