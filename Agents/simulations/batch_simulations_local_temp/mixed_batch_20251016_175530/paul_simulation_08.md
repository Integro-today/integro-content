## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_8:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**paul_persona_3**: Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... whatever's going on with me. I guess I'm here because Amanda says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting, and I can't lose her.

I don't buy into all this spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but three weeks in Costa Rica - maybe it'll fix whatever's broken. I just need to sleep through the night and stop being so damn angry all the time.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Sleep through the night without waking up shouting
2. Release the anger that keeps taking over
3. Keep Amanda safe and close

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah... that's about right. I hate that she worries about me. Hate that my kids see me like this sometimes.

I just want to be the man they think I am. Not some... broken thing that can't even sleep right.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I sleep peacefully through the night
2. I release the anger that frightens my family
3. I become the man my family believes I am

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_3**: The second one. The anger. That's the one that's eating everything alive.

But I don't know about "release" - sounds too soft. Like I'm just supposed to let go of something that's been keeping me alive for fifteen years. That anger got me through three tours. It's not some... feelings thing I can just breathe away.

I need to keep my edge. Just... not aimed at the people I love.


**intentions_workflow_8**: I hear that. The anger kept you alive - it's not the enemy, just pointed wrong.

How about: "I channel my strength to protect, not harm my family"


**paul_persona_3**: That's better. Still feels like I'm some warrior poet or something, but... yeah. I can work with that.

I need to figure out how to be strong without being dangerous. Protect them like I protected my unit, not... whatever this is now.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: I channel my strength to protect, not harm my family

How do the other two land?


**paul_persona_3**: The third one... "become the man my family believes I am" - that's a lot of pressure. What if I can't? What if they believe in something that doesn't exist?

Maybe something like... I don't know. "I show up for my family with patience instead of fear"? Too wordy?

And the sleep thing... I need something that doesn't make me sound weak. Can't have "peacefully" in there. Makes me feel like some yoga instructor.


**intentions_workflow_8**: I hear you. Let's adjust:

1. I sleep through the night without waking up shouting
2. I channel my strength to protect, not harm my family
3. I show up for my family with patience instead of fear

How do these feel?


**paul_persona_3**: Better. I can live with these.

The sleep one still bothers me - makes it sound like I'm some kind of... I don't know. Like I'm admitting there's something wrong with me. But I guess that's why I'm doing this whole thing, right?

I just need to know I won't lose myself in the process. That I come back from Costa Rica still me, just... better.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ All 3 locked in:
1. I sleep through the night without waking up shouting
2. I channel my strength to protect, not harm my family
3. I show up for my family with patience instead of fear

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**paul_persona_3**: Thanks. I just... I need this to work. Amanda's been patient for too long, and I'm running out of chances.

Three weeks. Then I'll see what this plant medicine can actually do.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three weeks to show up different. You've got solid intentions to work with.

The medicine meets you where you are. Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. We'll see about that.

I've trusted a lot of things in my life - my training, my instincts, my brothers. This is... different. But I'm out of other options.

Guess I'll find out what meets me when I get there.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Different kind of trust than combat. Less about control, more about showing up.

Your intentions are locked in. Let them do their work.


**paul_persona_3**: Less about control. Right.

That's the part that keeps me up at night, you know? Not being able to control what happens in my own head. In the cockpit, I had procedures, protocols, training. This? Flying blind into my own damn mind.

But yeah. They're locked in. I'll figure out the rest when I get there.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Flying blind into your own mind - that's exactly what it is. No instruments, no flight plan.

The intentions will be there when you need them. Even when the cockpit goes dark.


**paul_persona_3**: When the cockpit goes dark... that's when things get real.

Funny thing is, I've been there before. Not with ayahuasca, but with those dreams. Sometimes I wake up and I swear I'm back there, flying through hell and can't see a damn thing. Maybe this is just... facing that darkness on my own terms instead of pretending it doesn't exist.

Alright. I'm gonna hold onto these three things when it gets rough.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Facing it on your terms instead of waiting for it to ambush you at 3 AM.

That's the difference. You're choosing to fly into it this time.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Damn right I am.

Tired of feeling like a passenger in my own head. Tired of Amanda lying there pretending to sleep while I'm fighting battles that ended years ago.

This time, I'm the one calling the flight plan. Even if I don't know where the hell we're going.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You're taking the controls back. That's what matters.

Keep those intentions close when the turbulence hits.


**paul_persona_3**: I will.

Thanks for... well, for helping me get these down. In black and white. Where I can't pretend they're not real.

See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_8**: They're real. And they'll be waiting for you.

See you on the other side.


**paul_persona_3**: Roger that.


**intentions_workflow_8**: *Roger that.*


**paul_persona_3**: Old habits die hard.


**intentions_workflow_8**: They do. But you're building new ones now.


**paul_persona_3**: Three weeks. Gotta build a lot of new habits in three weeks.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three weeks is enough to start. One habit at a time.


**paul_persona_3**: One at a time... yeah, I can do that.

Been waking up at 4:30 for years anyway. Maybe tomorrow I’ll just... sit with it. Instead of running.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's how it begins. Sit with it instead of running.

The intentions will meet you there.


**paul_persona_3**: 4:30 tomorrow. Coffee. Silence. No running shoes.

Got it.


**intentions_workflow_8**: 4:30. Coffee. Silence. No running shoes.

Simple. Solid.


**paul_persona_3**: Solid I can do.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Then let's set your compass.

Three intentions to guide these three weeks. What needs to shift most?


**paul_persona_3**: I don’t want to keep scaring Amanda awake. That’s first.

Second—figure out what’s behind the yelling without calling it some diagnosis I don’t believe in.

Third—come back from Costa Rica with something I can actually use, not just talk about.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:
1. Let Amanda sleep through the night
2. See what's fueling the yelling without labels
3. Bring home tools I'll actually practice

Let's turn these into intentions.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Turn 'em into something I can plant in my head before the medicine hits.
