  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, Amanda saying I scare her when I wake up shouting. I can't keep going like this, but I don't have some big spiritual quest or whatever. I just need to sleep through the night and stop being angry all the time.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Stop being angry all the time  \n3. Create safety for Amanda and yourself\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are... yeah. That's it. \n\nI need to sleep without seeing their faces. Need to stop snapping at Amanda and the kids over nothing. Need to figure out how to be the man they think I am, not the one who wakes up ready to fight ghosts.\n\nHow do we turn that into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I respond with calm instead of anger\n3. I reclaim the man my family believes I am\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The third one's too soft. \"Reclaim\" sounds like some therapy talk. \n\nHow about... \"I protect my family by being the man they need me to be.\" That's what I'm doing. Protecting them\u2014from me, from whatever this is that's leaking out. Same thing, but it makes sense to me.\n\nThe sleep one... I don't know. \"I sleep peacefully\" feels like I'm asking for a miracle. Maybe just \"I face the night without fear.\" That's more honest. I don't need perfect sleep, I just need to stop fighting when I close my eyes.\n\nThe middle one about anger... that one's right. Simple. Direct.",

You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Alright. They're in my wallet now. Been carrying that thing through three deployments and sixteen years of marriage. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for... I don't know. Making it simple. I was expecting a lot more... I don't know what I was expecting. But this feels like something I can actually do.",
  "system4": "Solid compass. \n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're already doing their job.",
  "user4": "Good. Because I probably will forget them when things get rough in there. I don't even know what \"rough\" means with this stuff, but I'm not naive enough to think it'll be easy.\n\nJust... if I lose my way completely, if I can't remember anything else - these will still be working? Even if I'm not thinking about them?",
  "system5": "Even when you can't remember your own name, these intentions keep working. The medicine knows what you came for.\n\nTrust that.",
  "user5": "That's... that's good. Because I don't trust much these days, but I trust that if I show up and do the work, things happen. Always been that way. Flying, business, marriage - show up, do the work, results follow.\n\nI'll show up. Do whatever this is. Let the medicine do its job.",
  "system6": "That's the way. \n\nShow up. Let it work. The rest follows.",
  "user6": "Alright then. Three weeks. Feels like forever and too soon all at once. \n\nGuess I'll just... keep showing up until then.",
  "system7": "That's all there is.\n\nKeep showing up.",
  "user7": "Copy that.",

  "user12": "I need to stop waking up screaming. That's first. Amanda can't keep living like this, jumping out of bed when I start thrashing around. Three nights a week, minimum. Sometimes I see her watching me when she thinks I'm asleep, like she's waiting for it to happen.\n\nSecond... I guess I need to figure out how to be around my kids without this constant edge. My boy asked why I always look angry now. I'm not angry at them, but they don't know that.\n\nThird... I don't know how to say this without sounding like one of those guys, but I need to find a way to carry what I saw over there without it eating me alive. I did my job, I don't regret it, but it's like I'm still flying those missions every damn night.\n\nThat's it. That's what I need this plant stuff to fix.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Be present with my kids without the constant edge\n3. Carry what I saw without it eating me alive\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah, those are the three. I don't know how to pretty it up or make it sound like the right kind of intention or whatever you call it. Just need those nightmares to stop, need to stop snapping at my kids when they haven't done anything wrong, and need to figure out how to live with what happened over there without it poisoning everything here.\n\nHow do we do this?",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I show up calm and present with my kids\n3. I carry my service with honor instead of poison\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user14": "Number three... that's not right. \"Carry my service with honor\" - that's what they say at the funerals, the ceremonies, all that. But it's not the service that's the problem. It's what I couldn't stop from happening. The guys we lost. The decisions I made when there weren't good options.\n\nHow about: \"I carry the weight of what happened without letting it crush my family.\"\n\nAnd number one... \"sleep peacefully\" sounds like some kind of luxury I don't deserve. How about just \"I sleep through the night without waking up shouting.\"\n\nNumber two sits right. That's exactly what I need to do - show up calm and present instead of like I'm still in a damn cockpit waiting for incoming fire.",

  "user16": "Yeah... we'll see if this damn thing actually points anywhere useful.",
  "system17": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what comes.",
  "user17": "Trust what comes. Right. That's the part that keeps me up at night - what comes. What comes when I close my eyes is loud as hell and doesn't care about any damn compass.\n\nBut I hear you. I'll write these on something, keep 'em close.",
  "system18": "Good. Keep them close. The intentions will be waiting on your dashboard when you need them.",
  "user18": "Copy that. They'll be in my wallet\u2014same place I keep my wings.",
  "system19": "*Perfect place for them.*",
  "user19": "Yeah... been carrying those wings for twenty years. Maybe it's time I earned a different kind."
