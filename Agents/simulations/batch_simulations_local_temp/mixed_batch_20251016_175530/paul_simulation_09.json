  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares. Amanda says I scare her when I wake up shouting. I can't keep going like this.\n\nI'm doing this plant medicine thing in three weeks. First time. Don't believe in any of this stuff, but those guys at Heroic Hearts - they're solid. Former military. They wouldn't steer me wrong.\n\nI need to figure out how to stop being angry all the time. How to sleep through the night without waking up drenched in sweat. How to be the man my kids think I am, not the one who loses it over nothing.\n\nI can't lose her. Amanda's been patient but I see it in her eyes - she's getting tired of walking on eggshells around me.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares or shouting\n2. Release the constant anger that controls me\n3. Become the man my kids believe I am and keep Amanda from leaving\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's about right. \n\nI need to sleep without seeing those damn explosions every time I close my eyes. Need to stop jumping out of bed ready to fight ghosts. Amanda says I shout things - names of guys I served with, coordinates, stuff I don't even remember saying.\n\nThe anger's getting worse. Yesterday I almost put my fist through the wall because the coffee maker was taking too long. It's like there's this rage always simmering right under the surface, ready to blow. My employees at work - they see it sometimes. My kids definitely see it.\n\nAnd my kids... they still look at me like I'm their hero. But Jake's getting older - he's fourteen. He sees things now. Watches me when I think he's not looking. I want to be the dad he deserves before he decides I'm just another angry man who can't get his shit together.\n\nIf I lose Amanda... I can't even think about that. She's the only thing that makes sense anymore.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing explosions or shouting\n2. I release the rage that controls me and find steady ground\n3. I become the father my kids deserve and the man Amanda chose to love\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest. \"I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing explosions or shouting.\" That's... that's exactly it. Simple, direct. No soft language about \"processing trauma\" or any of that crap. Just - I need to sleep without waking up ready to fight.\n\nThe second one's good too, but \"find steady ground\" sounds a little... I don't know. Weak? Maybe \"I release the rage that controls me and stay steady\" or something. I need to stay in control, not find some mystical ground.\n\nThe third one... yeah. \"I become the father my kids deserve and the man Amanda chose to love.\" That's real. That's what I'm afraid of losing.\n\nCan we make the second one stronger? Less therapy-speak?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing explosions or shouting\n\nHow about: \"I release the rage that controls me and stay steady when triggered\" - does that land stronger?\n\nAnd the third one feels right as is?",
  "user3": "Yeah, that's better. \"I release the rage that controls me and stay steady when triggered.\" That's real - I get triggered by stupid stuff. Loud noises, crowds, people moving too fast around me. I need to stay steady when that happens instead of going from zero to ready-to-fight in two seconds.\n\nThe third one's good. \"I become the father my kids deserve and the man Amanda chose to love.\" Though... I don't know. Part of me wants to make it even more direct. Like \"I become the man Amanda wants to stay married to\" or something. But that sounds desperate.\n\nYeah. The third one's fine as is.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I release the rage that controls me and stay steady when triggered\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I become the father my kids deserve and the man Amanda chose to love\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing explosions or shouting\n2. I release the rage that controls me and stay steady when triggered\n3. I become the father my kids deserve and the man Amanda chose to love\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. Three things to remember when I'm down there in Costa Rica. \n\nI keep looking at these like they're supposed to fix everything. But they're just... directions. Like you said - a compass, not a destination.\n\nI still don't know if this plant medicine stuff will work. But at least I know what I'm aiming for. That's more than I've had in a long time.\n\nThanks. I guess we'll see what happens in a few weeks.",
  "system5": "Exactly. A compass, not a fix.\n\nThe medicine will show you what you need. These intentions just point toward what matters most.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Ready as I'll ever be, I guess. \n\nBeen carrying this stuff around for fifteen years. Maybe it's time to set some of it down.",
  "system6": "Fifteen years is a long time to carry anything heavy.\n\nThe medicine's good at helping people set things down. Trust that process.",
  "user6": "Yeah... fifteen years of waking up ready to fight ghosts. \n\nI'm tired, man. Just... tired.",
  "system7": "Being tired means you're ready to stop carrying it.\n\nThe medicine recognizes that kind of tired.",
  "user7": "Good. Because I'm done pretending this isn't breaking me down. Done pretending I don't need help.\n\nJust... don't want to lose myself in the process, you know?",
  "system8": "You won't lose yourself. The medicine strips away what isn't you - not what's core.\n\nTrust that the parts worth keeping will stay.",
  "user8": "Alright. I can work with that.\n\nThe parts worth keeping... like being strong for my family. Being reliable. Protecting people. Those stay.\n\nJust maybe I won't have to be so damn angry about it anymore.",
  "system9": "Exactly. You keep the strength that protects. Lose the anger that poisons it.\n\nThe medicine knows the difference.",
  "user9": "That's what I need to remember when I'm down there. \n\nKeep the good stuff. Let go of the poison. Simple as that.",
  "system10": "Simple as that. The medicine will show you which is which.\n\nTrust what you're already clear about.",
  "user10": "Yeah. I know what matters - Amanda, the kids, being someone they can count on.\n\nEverything else... the anger, the nightmares, the stuff that makes me someone they walk on eggshells around... that can go.\n\nI know the difference. I just need to let the medicine help me act on it.",
  "system11": "Three threads:\n\n1. Keep being reliable for Amanda and the kids\n2. Drop the anger that makes home feel dangerous  \n3. Sleep without nightmares haunting you\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user11": "Alright. Let me think...\n\nFirst one: \"I intend to show up for my family with the same strength, but without the edge that cuts them.\"\n\nSecond: \"I intend to let go of this anger that's poisoning my home. I don't need it to be strong.\"\n\nThird... this one's harder. \"I intend to face whatever's haunting me at night, and find a way to make peace with it. So I can rest.\"\n\nThat work?",
  "system12": "Good direction. Let me sharpen these:\n\n1. \"I show up strong for my family without the edge that cuts\"\n2. \"I release the anger poisoning my home\"\n3. \"I make peace with what haunts me at night\"\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user12": "Cleaner. More direct.\n\nI like how you cut out all the extra words. That's how I think anyway - just get to the point.\n\nThese feel... possible. Like something I can actually hold onto when things get rough down there.",
  "system13": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I show up strong for my family without the edge that cuts\n2. I release the anger poisoning my home  \n3. I make peace with what haunts me at night\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user13": "Good. Got 'em.\n\nThanks for helping me get this straight. Three simple things to hold onto when everything else is spinning.\n\nI'll remember these.",
  "system14": "Solid compass. Trust them when things get wild.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user14": "Appreciate it. Been a long time since I felt ready for anything.",
  "system15": "That readiness matters. Hold onto it.",
  "user15": "Yeah. This time I'm holding on tight.",
  "system16": "Good. Let that grip steady you when the medicine starts moving things around.",
  "user16": "When it starts moving things... what if it moves too much? What if I can't put it back together the way it was?\n\nAmanda's counting on me to come back better. Not broken.",
  "system17": "The medicine doesn't break what's real - it strips away what isn't. You'll come back more yourself, not less.\n\nTrust the intentions you set. They'll anchor you when things shift.",
  "user17": "More myself. Right.\n\nJust... what if she doesn't like who I really am underneath all this? What if I've been pretending so long I don't even know who that is anymore?",
  "system18": "You'll meet yourself down there. If she matters, she'll meet that version too.\n\nThe pretending ends either way - better to know what you're working with than keep guessing.",
  "user18": "Guess I've been guessing a long time, huh?\n\nAlways thought I had to be someone else to protect them. Maybe they never needed protecting from me.",
  "system19": "That's the realization right there. All that energy spent hiding - when maybe they just wanted you present.\n\nLet that truth settle in.",
  "user19": "Present. Haven't been that in years. Not really.\n\nAlways scanning the room, always one foot out the door. Even at the dinner table. My kids probably think I care more about my phone than them."
