Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm trying to figure out what actually matters anymore. I've built this life that looks perfect from the outside\u2014sold my company, all the right boxes checked\u2014but it feels hollow. Like I've been climbing a ladder that's leaning against the wrong wall.\n\nThere's this... emptiness? No, that's not quite right. It's more like I'm standing at this crossroads with all these paths, and I don't know which one leads somewhere meaningful. My grandmother used to talk about serving something bigger than yourself, and I keep thinking about that.\n\nI want to serve, I want to make a difference, but I don't want to lose myself in another achievement trap. Does that make sense?",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond external success\n2. Serving something bigger without losing yourself \n3. Choosing meaningful direction instead of hollow achievement\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the pieces I'm wrestling with. It's like\u2014I know how to build things, scale them, make them profitable. But I don't know how to build a life that feels like mine. Not just another impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 line.\n\nMy kids are growing up so fast, and sometimes I catch myself treating time with them like another item on my to-do list. Check. Quality time completed. Move to next task. That's not who I want to be.\n\nI keep thinking about those ayahuasca visions\u2014those women, my ancestors maybe, showing me how to weave things back together. But I don't know how to do that weaving in real life. Between my business world and my spiritual seeking. Between being Ellen the entrepreneur and Ellen the... whatever I'm becoming.\n\nThe ibogaine feels different than the other medicines. More direct. Like it won't let me hide behind my usual patterns.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I build a life that feels like mine, not another achievement\n2. I weave together my business world and spiritual seeking  \n3. I show up fully present with my kids instead of checking boxes\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hard\u2014\"I build a life that feels like mine.\" That's exactly it. I've been building everyone else's version of success for so long, I don't even know what mine looks like anymore.\n\nThe second one... I don't know. \"Weave together\" feels too soft, maybe? Too abstract. Maybe something like \"I integrate my spiritual insights into my daily choices\" or \"I stop compartmentalizing who I am.\"\n\nThe third one\u2014yes. Though it's not just the kids. It's David too. He looks at me sometimes like I'm this stranger who's always half somewhere else, even when I'm sitting right next to him.\n\nMaybe instead of \"checking boxes,\" something about being fully here. Not just physically present but... emotionally available? Connected?",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I build a life that feels like mine, not another achievement\n2. I integrate my spiritual insights into my daily choices\n3. I show up fully present and emotionally available with David and my kids\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "These feel... real. Like they're pointing to the actual problem, not just the symptoms.\n\nThe first one makes my chest tight\u2014in a good way, I think. Like finally admitting something I've been avoiding.\n\nThe second one scares me a little because I know what that means. It means I can't keep living this double life where I meditate for twenty minutes then spend the next twelve hours in back-to-back board meetings pretending that's enough. It means actually changing how I move through each day, not just adding another spiritual practice to check off.\n\nThe third one... yeah. David deserves more than what I've been giving him. The kids definitely do. I'm tired of them seeing the top of my head while I scroll through emails during dinner.\n\nI think these are right. Though part of me wants to add something about finding my next purpose, my next chapter of service. Is that too much? Or is that just the old pattern\u2014always needing to achieve something, even in my intentions?",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I build a life that feels like mine, not another achievement\n2. I integrate my spiritual insights into my daily choices  \n3. I show up fully present and emotionally available with David and my kids\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I... I needed this. Someone to help me get past my own spinning and just name what's true.\n\nI keep thinking about what my grandmother would say. She'd probably just smile and say it's about time I stopped running so fast. Maybe these intentions will help me finally stand still long enough to hear what she's been trying to tell me all along.\n\nI'll keep them close.",
  "system5": "Standing still long enough to hear\u2014that's the work now. \n\nThese intentions will hold you steady when the medicine shows you what you've been running from. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah... running. That's what I've been doing, isn't it? Just in different shoes each time.\n\nI'm scared. But also... ready? If that makes sense. Like I've been preparing for this moment without knowing it. All those retreats, all those glimpses of something deeper\u2014they were getting me ready to actually stop and face whatever's been chasing me.\n\nI don't know what the ibogaine will show me. But maybe for once, I don't need to know the outcome. Maybe I can just... let it happen.",
  "system6": "That's it exactly. Let it happen.\n\nThe running shoes are off. The medicine will show you what you've been too busy to see. These intentions will keep you pointed toward what matters when everything familiar falls away.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "I feel... calm. For the first time in months, maybe years. Not the forced calm I use in board meetings when everything's falling apart, but something real. Grounded.\n\nThe eagle part of me always wants to soar above everything, see the whole picture, control the outcome. The antelope just wants to stay vigilant, ready to bolt. Maybe it's time to stop being both for once and just... be Ellen. Whatever that means.\n\nI'm ready to stop running.",
  "system7": "Good. \n\nStay with that grounded feeling. Let it carry you into the ceremony.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "Thank you. For helping me find my way to this place before I go in. I don't feel alone in this anymore.\n\nSee you on the other side.",

Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user12": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Beond says this might help me find what I'm looking for, so here I am. I can't keep going like this\u2014building companies, making money, sitting on boards. It's all just... noise. \n\nMy grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything. I think I've lost that somewhere.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding meaning beyond the noise of business and money\n2. Reconnecting with the divine spark your grandmother saw\n3. Discovering what you're actually looking for\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I've been chasing the wrong things for so long I don't even know what the right things look like anymore. \n\nMy grandmother would light candles on Friday nights and somehow make our cramped apartment feel like sacred space. She saw God in everything\u2014in the bread we broke, in the stories she told. I want to see the world like that again.",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what truly matters beyond the noise\n2. I reclaim the sacred sight my grandmother carried\n3. I find what I'm actually searching for\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user14": "The second one... that's the one that hits. \"I reclaim the sacred sight my grandmother carried.\" \n\nBut maybe less poetic? I don't know. I need something I can actually hold onto when I'm in there, not some pretty phrase that'll float away. Something like... \"I see what my grandmother saw.\" Simple. Direct.",
  "system15": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I see what my grandmother saw\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user15": "The first one feels right too. Not just discovering what matters\u2014it's like I need permission to stop chasing the wrong things. \"I discover what truly matters beyond the noise.\" Yeah. That works.\n\nThe third one though... \"I find what I'm actually searching for.\" I don't know. Feels too vague? Like I'm supposed to have some big epiphany about my life's purpose. What if I don't find anything? What if there isn't some grand answer?\n\nMaybe something more like... \"I stop running long enough to hear what's already there.\"",
  "system16": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I discover what truly matters beyond the noise\n2. I see what my grandmother saw\n3. I stop running long enough to hear what's already there\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user16": "I... I'm ready. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system17": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user17": "Trust what comes... right. That's the hard part for someone like me. I've built my whole life on controlling outcomes, optimizing everything. Letting go feels like jumping without a parachute.\n\nBut maybe that's exactly what I need.",
  "system18": "Exactly. The medicine knows what to do with someone who's always needed to know.",
  "user18": "Yeah... that's me. Always needed to know the next move, the right answer, the winning strategy. Even with all this spiritual searching, I think I can think my way to enlightenment. Pretty ridiculous when I say it out loud.\n\nMaybe that's why I keep coming back to these medicines. They don't care about my business plans or my board meetings. They just... show me what I need to see, whether I want to see it or not.",
  "system19": "They strip away the strategies and show you what's real. The intentions you set will help you stay open to that.",
  "user19": "That's what I'm afraid of, isn't it? That what's real won't match up with who I think I am. All these achievements, all this success... what if the medicine shows me it was just armor? What if underneath there's just... nothing?\n\nMy grandmother never cared about any of that stuff. She just... was. Present. Connected to something bigger. I keep thinking if I could see what she saw, maybe I'd finally feel grounded in something that actually matters."
