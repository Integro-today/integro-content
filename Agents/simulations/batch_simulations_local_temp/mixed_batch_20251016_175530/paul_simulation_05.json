  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with... whatever's going on with me. I just need to sleep through the night without waking up Amanda. She's worried sick and I can't keep doing this to her.\n\nI guess I'm here because I need to figure out how to stop being so damn angry all the time. The kids... they walk on eggshells around me now. My business is fine, everything looks fine from the outside. But it's not fine.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Release the anger that has the kids walking on eggshells\n3. Find what's underneath the surface that's not fine\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's about right. Though I hate saying it out loud. Makes me sound like one of those guys who can't handle their business.\n\nI need to stop waking up shouting in the middle of the night. Amanda says I grab her arm sometimes, like I'm still flying missions. She pretends it doesn't scare her but I see it in her eyes.\n\nAnd these kids... used to think I hung the moon. Now they flinch when I raise my voice over stupid stuff like dishes. I'm turning into my old man and I swore I'd never do that.\n\nI don't know what's underneath all this. That's the problem. I've been pushing it down for so long, just doing what needs to be done, being reliable Paul. Maybe that's what needs breaking open.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety and connection with my family\n3. I break open what I've been pushing down to find what's real\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me hardest. \"Reclaim safety and connection with my family.\" That gets to the heart of it. \n\nBut I need to adjust it. Makes me sound like I lost them already. They're still here, I'm still here. I just need to... I don't know, find my way back to being someone they can trust not to explode.\n\nHow about: \"I show up with steady presence for Amanda and the kids.\" Something like that. More about what I need to become, not what I failed at.\n\nThe sleep thing... yeah, that's important. But it's just a symptom, right? The real issue is deeper. It's about who I am when I'm not in control.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I show up with steady presence for Amanda and the kids\"\n\nHow about adjusting intention 1 to match that focus - something like \"I rest in steady presence through the night\"? Keeps it about presence rather than just sleep mechanics.\n\nAnd intention 3 could be \"I discover who I am beneath the control\" - sound right?",
  "user3": "Yeah... \"I rest in steady presence through the night.\" That works. It's not just about not having nightmares, it's about finding some kind of peace even when I'm unconscious. I can get behind that.\n\nThe third one though... \"I discover who I am beneath the control.\" I don't know if I'm ready for that. What if what's underneath is worse? What if I'm just... broken? What if I find out all that stoic Marine crap was just covering up something that's fundamentally messed up?\n\nMaybe something more like \"I face what's been buried without losing myself.\" I don't want to discover I'm not who I thought I was. I just want to stop being who I've become.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I rest in steady presence through the night\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I face what's been buried without losing myself\"\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I rest in steady presence through the night\n2. I show up with steady presence for Amanda and the kids\n3. I face what's been buried without losing myself\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. So these are... these are good. They're mine. \n\nI keep looking at them, trying to find something wrong with them, some way they make me sound weak. But they don't. They're about being stronger, not weaker. About being solid instead of just... holding everything together with duct tape and anger.\n\nI got three weeks before Costa Rica. Three weeks to carry these words around, see how they feel. Maybe write them down somewhere, though I don't know if I'm ready for Amanda to see them yet. She might think I'm getting soft.\n\nBut maybe that's the point. Maybe getting soft is how you stop being brittle.",
  "system5": "That's it exactly - solid instead of held together with duct tape. The intentions hold their own weight now.\n\nThree weeks is good time to let them settle in. They'll shift how you see things - not because you're forcing it, but because they're pointing toward what's already true underneath.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah. I'll... I'll try to trust it. Harder than it sounds, trusting something I can't see or control. But I've trusted worse things in my life - orders that got people killed, weather reports that turned out wrong, politicians who sent us places we shouldn't have been.\n\nAt least these intentions are mine. Nobody forced them on me. I chose them, even if I needed help finding the words.\n\nThree weeks. I'll carry them close, see what changes. Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Either way, I'm showing up.",
  "system6": "That's all anyone can ask - showing up with what's yours.\n\nThe medicine will meet you there.",
  "user6": "The medicine... I keep thinking about that word. Medicine. Not drugs, not some recreational thing. Medicine for whatever's been eating at me since I got back.\n\nI don't know what to expect. Probably nothing. Probably just some weird dreams and puking in the jungle. But maybe... maybe it'll show me something I need to see. Something about who I was before all this, or who I could be after.\n\nThree weeks. Then I'll find out if these intentions mean anything when I'm staring down whatever's been hiding in the dark.",
  "system7": "Medicine finds what's ready to move. Whether it's nothing or everything, you'll meet it with your intentions already set. That's enough for now.",
  "user7": "Enough for now. Yeah. \n\nI've been through worse. Been through things that should have killed me. This... this is just different. Not about surviving, but about actually living again.\n\nI'll carry these words with me. Let them do whatever they're supposed to do.",
  "system8": "Exactly. You know how to survive - now you get to learn how to live. The intentions will travel with you.",
  "user8": "Learn how to live. Jesus. When did that become something I needed to learn? Used to think I had it all figured out - serve, provide, protect. Simple.\n\nBut maybe simple isn't the same as alive. Maybe I've just been... existing. Going through motions. Following orders I gave myself.\n\nLearning how to live. Starting at 42. Better late than dead, I guess.",
  "system9": "42 beats never. Most people don't get the chance to learn it twice - they just keep following the same orders until the end.\n\nYou're already doing it differently by noticing.",
  "user9": "Noticing. Yeah. That's something I can do. Been trained to notice threats, changes in terrain, problems before they explode. Maybe I can use those same eyes to notice what's actually worth living for.\n\nNot just what needs fixing or protecting, but... what makes it all matter. What makes Amanda laugh that real laugh. What makes my kids look at me like I'm still their hero.\n\nHaven't looked at life that way in a long time.",
  "system10": "Those eyes work both ways - threat detection and beauty recognition. Same skill, different target.\n\nThe laugh and the hero thing - that's already in your sights now.",
  "user10": "Yeah. It's... it's been a while since I really saw them, you know? Not just making sure they're safe and fed and the bills are paid. But actually *saw* them. Amanda's face when she's reading, how she tucks her hair behind her ear. The way my daughter gets this look when she's concentrating - same look her mom has.\n\nI've been looking *at* them for years without really seeing them. Like they're part of the mission parameters instead of... instead of being the whole damn point.\n\nMaybe it's time to change what I'm looking for.",
  "system11": "Mission parameters to meaning makers - that's the shift. Same focus, different purpose.\n\nSee them as they are, not as what needs protecting. You'll find the point was there the whole time.",
  "user11": "The point was there the whole time. While I was scanning rooftops and watching corners, I missed what was right in front of me. They're not objectives to secure - they're... they're why any of it matters.\n\nDon't know how I forgot that. How I started seeing my own family like potential threats to manage instead of people to love.\n\nTime to stand down from high alert. See what's actually here.",
  "system12": "Stand down and see. The alert served its purpose - kept you alive to reach this moment.\n\nNow you get to discover what alive actually feels like when you're not at war with it.",
  "user12": "Not at war with being alive. That's... that's a hell of a thought. Been fighting against my own life for years without knowing it. Fighting the nightmares, fighting the memories, fighting the softness that might make me weak.\n\nBut I'm still here. Made it through all of it. Maybe it's time to stop fighting everything, including myself.\n\nSee what this life actually feels like when I'm not treating it like enemy territory.",
  "system13": "Exactly. The war's over but you've been stuck on patrol. Time to come home to your own life.\n\nSee how it feels to walk through your days without armor.",
  "user13": "Without armor. Christ. That might be scarier than any deployment. Armor's all I've known for twenty years - first the flight suit, then the business suits, then just... this wall I built around everything.\n\nBut Amanda's tired of talking to a fortress. My kids deserve more than a guard tower for a father.\n\nMaybe it's time to find out who I am when I'm not standing watch.",
  "system14": "The fortress kept you safe. Now it's keeping you alone. \n\nTime to learn who you are when you're not on watch. You're already doing it - noticing the wall, seeing what it costs.",
  "user14": "Yeah. I built it strong - kept everything out, including the people I love most. Thought I was protecting them, but really I was just... isolating myself. Making sure nobody could reach me.\n\nNot just alone. Lonely. Haven't admitted that to anyone. Not even myself, really.\n\nBut here I am. Talking about it. Maybe the wall's already got some cracks in it.",
  "system15": "Cracks are how the light gets in. You admitting it - that's the first breach in the wall.\n\nThe loneliness has been trying to tell you something: the fortress became a prison. Time to walk out.",
  "user15": "Walk out. After all these years, just... walk out. Don't know if I remember how.\n\nThe loneliness has been screaming at me and I've been drowning it out with work, with routine, with anything that keeps me moving. But it's been there every night when I wake up sweating. Every morning when I look at Amanda and don't know what to say.\n\nMaybe it's time to listen to what it's been trying to tell me.",
  "system16": "Listen to what the loneliness knows: you survived the war but forgot how to come home. The screaming isn't weakness - it's your life calling you back.\n\nTime to answer it.",
  "user16": "My life's been calling and I've been letting it go to voicemail. Pretending I didn't hear it ring.\n\nBut it's been ringing every night. Every time Amanda's eyes look past me instead of at me. Every time I can't remember what my kids laughed about that day.\n\nI survived Afghanistan. Lost some brothers there, but I survived. Maybe it's time to stop surviving and start... living again. Whatever that looks like.",
  "system17": "Survived the war. Now survive the coming home. That's the real deployment - learning to live instead of just staying alive.\n\nYour family's been waiting for you to answer that call.",
  "user17": "They're still waiting. Even though I'm physically here, I never really came back. Been deployed in my own home for years.\n\nAmanda's been raising our kids with a ghost. A ghost who looks like their father but doesn't know how to be present. How to be touched. How to just... be there.\n\nThree weeks. In three weeks I drink that medicine and see if I can finally come home for real.",
  "system18": "Three weeks to set your compass for coming home. Let's build intentions that will guide you back to being alive in your own life.\n\nThree threads:\n1. Drop the armor and feel what it's like to be human again\n2. Reclaim connection with Amanda and your kids\n3. Stop surviving and start living\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "Drop the armor. Christ, that terrifies me. But I'm already thinking about what it'd feel like to wake up without this weight. To not have to be the strong one for once.\n\nConnection. Real connection. Not just sitting at the same dinner table but... actually being there. Letting Amanda see me instead of just the version of me I think she wants.\n\nAnd living. Actually living. Not just getting through each day without crashing.\n\nHow do I even start to put that into words? Into something I can carry with me into that ceremony?",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I drop the armor and feel the weight lift from my chest\n2. I show up fully present when my family reaches for me\n3. I choose living over surviving, one breath at a time\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The first one hits hardest. \"I drop the armor and feel the weight lift from my chest.\" My chest gets tight just reading it, but there's something... real there.\n\nSecond one's good but... I need to reach for them too. Not just show up when they come to me.\n\nAnd the third one - \"one breath at a time\" sounds right. That's how I got through those flights. One breath, one moment at a time.\n\nMaybe the second one should be \"I reach back when my family reaches for me.\" Because I've been making them do all the reaching."
