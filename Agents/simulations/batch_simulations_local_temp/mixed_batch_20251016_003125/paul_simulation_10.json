  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know how to do this. Heroic Hearts says I need these intention things for the ceremony, but I've never done anything like this before. \n\nI just need to stop waking up screaming. Amanda can't keep living like this, and neither can I.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without screaming\n2. Create peace for Amanda \n3. Find healing from what drives the nightmares\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the things. I just need to figure out how to say them right. \n\nI don't want to lose her. She's already walking on eggshells around me, and I hate that look in her eyes when I wake up yelling about things she doesn't understand. \n\nBut I can't... I can't be one of those guys who falls apart. I need to fix this without becoming weak.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make home safe for Amanda again\n3. I face what haunts me without breaking\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one that hits hardest - \"I make home safe for Amanda again.\" \n\nBecause that's what matters. My kids need to see their mom not flinching when I walk into the room. She used to laugh at my dumb jokes, you know? Now she just... waits. Like she's bracing for something.\n\nI just need the words to be stronger. More... I don't know. Like a mission statement. Something I can hold onto when this plant stuff gets weird.",
  "system3": "I make home safe for Amanda again.\n\nHow about: \"I reclaim safety for my family\" - stronger, mission-focused.\n\nThe other two:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n3. I face what haunts me without breaking\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "\"I reclaim safety for my family\" - yeah, that's better. That's what I do. I'm a protector, not... whatever I've become.\n\nThe other two... I don't know. \"I sleep peacefully through the night\" sounds too soft. Like something from a pillow commercial. And \"I face what haunts me without breaking\" - what if I do break? What if this stuff makes me fall apart in front of everybody?\n\nI need something that doesn't make me sound weak before I even start.",
  "system4": "Stronger versions:\n\n1. I claim restful sleep through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for my family\n3. I confront what haunts me and stay standing\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user4": "\"I confront what haunts me and stay standing\" - now that's something I can work with. That's a mission. That's what we do - we stay standing no matter what.\n\nThe sleep one still feels... I don't know. Maybe \"I claim restful nights\" instead? Shorter. More like taking territory than asking permission.\n\n\"I reclaim safety for my family\" stays. That's the mission that matters most.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I claim restful nights\n2. I reclaim safety for my family\n3. I confront what haunts me and stay standing\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Got it. I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years through three deployments. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks until Costa Rica. I can do this.",
  "system6": "You can. Three weeks is time to prepare, not worry.\n\nThe medicine knows what to do with a soldier who's ready to fight for his family. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "I've been in tougher spots than this. Flew through anti-aircraft fire over Kandahar - I can handle some jungle tea.\n\nJust... what if I see things I can't unsee? What if this stuff makes me remember things I've worked damn hard to bury?",
  "system7": "The medicine shows you what you're ready to see, even when it doesn't feel that way.\n\nWhat you've buried isn't gone - it's just waiting. Better to face it on your terms than have it ambush you at 3 AM again.\n\nYou've survived anti-aircraft fire. You can survive remembering.\n\nTrust the process.",
  "user7": "Better to face it on my terms. That's what we learned - take the fight to the enemy, don't wait for them to come to you.\n\nMaybe that's what the nightmares are. My brain trying to ambush me because I'm too stubborn to look at this stuff head-on.\n\nAlright. I'll trust it. But I'm keeping my eyes open.",
  "system8": "That's the spirit - eyes open, moving forward.\n\nThe medicine works with warriors who show up ready. You've got the right approach.",
  "user8": "Thanks. I appreciate you helping me get this straight in my head. Three weeks. I'll be ready.",
  "system9": "You'll be ready. Safe travels, and trust what comes.",
  "user9": "Copy that. I'll bring everything I learned here with me.",
  "system10": "Good. Carry it forward.",
  "user10": "Yeah. Forward. Always forward.",
  "system11": "Always.",
  "user11": "Semper fi.",
  "system12": "Semper fi.",
  "user12": "Three weeks. Rythmia. Amanda thinks I\u2019m going to some \u201cwellness retreat.\u201d I told her it\u2019s for vets, which is true, and left it at that. She kissed me like she used to\u2014hopeful\u2014and I felt it in my chest, that old pull I\u2019ve been missing.\n\nI keep replaying what we worked out: face the dreams, save the marriage, stay strong. I wrote the words on a card, slipped it behind my driver\u2019s license. Every time I open my wallet I see it. Reminds me why I\u2019m doing this plant stuff I still don\u2019t believe in.\n\nNight before last the rotor-wash dream came back\u2014sand, smell of fuel, somebody yelling \u201cAngel-One, angels one-six.\u201d I woke up swinging, knocked the lamp off the nightstand. Amanda didn\u2019t even flinch, just rolled over and pretended to sleep. That\u2019s when I knew I can\u2019t screw this up.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Face the nightmares head-on instead of waiting for the ambush\n2. Save your marriage by being the man Amanda kissed\n3. Stay strong through whatever the medicine shows you\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah. Let\u2019s lock these in.\n\n1. When the dream hits, I meet it\u2014no more swinging in the dark. I\u2019ll breathe, name what I see, let it pass through instead of bottling it up for the next ambush.\n\n2. I show Amanda the man she kissed\u2014steady eyes, open hands, no more snapping when the noise in my head gets loud. I\u2019ll ask her how her day went and actually listen.\n\n3. Whatever the medicine throws at me\u2014screams, flames, guilt\u2014I stay on my feet. I keep my word to myself, to her, to the kids. I come back stronger, not softer.",

Whatever the medicine throws, I stay on my feet and keep my word\n\nKeep the card where it is. Read it each morning with your coffee.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user14": "Copy. Card stays. Compass set. I\u2019ll see it through.",
  "system15": "See it through. Come back different.",
  "user15": "Different, not weaker. I\u2019ll bring it home.",
