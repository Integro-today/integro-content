  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this intention stuff might help with... everything. The nightmares, Amanda being scared of me, all of it. I can't keep going like this\u2014waking up shouting, seeing her flinch like I'm some kind of threat.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Create safety for Amanda \n3. Find healing from whatever's causing this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three. That's it exactly. I just want to sleep without seeing their faces again. Want Amanda to feel safe in her own house. And I guess... figure out what's broken in me without breaking everything else I've built.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing their faces\n2. I make Amanda feel safe in her own home\n3. I heal what's broken without destroying what I've built\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. Making Amanda feel safe\u2014that's everything. If I could just stop scaring her when I wake up... I don't know. Maybe \"I show up with calm strength so Amanda feels secure again.\" Something like that.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show up with calm strength so Amanda feels secure again.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... I need to face whatever's in those dreams, not just sleep through them. How about \"I face what haunts my nights with courage and honesty.\"\n\nAnd the third... I don't know. Maybe \"I find peace without losing the parts of me that matter.\" Too soft?",
  "system4": "First one's solid - \"I face what haunts my nights with courage and honesty\" is locked.\n\nThird one: \"I find peace without losing what makes me strong\" - stronger?\n\nHow do all three feel:\n1. I face what haunts my nights with courage and honesty\n2. I show up with calm strength so Amanda feels secure again  \n3. I find peace without losing what makes me strong",
  "user4": "Yeah. That third one's better\u2014keeps the warrior in it. These three... they feel right. Like I can carry them without feeling like I'm surrendering something I need.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I face what haunts my nights with courage and honesty\n2. I show up with calm strength so Amanda feels secure again  \n3. I find peace without losing what makes me strong\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system6": "Good. The wallet's seen everything you've been through - let it carry your way forward too.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah. It's carried me through a lot of places I didn't think I'd make it out of. Maybe it can carry me through this too.",
  "system7": "It already has. The difference is now you've named where you're headed.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user7": "Appreciate it. Guess we'll see what happens when the real journey starts.",
  "system8": "You will. The intentions are set - they'll work even when you forget them.\n\nGo when you're ready.",
  "user8": "Roger that.",
  "system9": "*Roger that.*",
  "user9": "Old habits die hard.",
  "system10": "They do. But they die easier when you know exactly what you're fighting for.\n\nTrust the compass.",
  "user10": "Copy that.",
  "system11": "*Copy that.*",
  "user11": "I'll see this through. For Amanda. For the kids. For whatever's left of me that's still worth saving.",
  "system12": "That's the voice to follow. Let it get louder.",
  "user12": "It\u2019s getting there.",
  "system13": "Good. Let it keep rising.",
  "user13": "Working on it.",
  "system14": "Keep going.",
  "user14": "I\u2019m here. That\u2019s all I got right now.",
  "system15": "That\u2019s enough.",
  "user15": "Copy.",
  "system16": "*Copy.*",
  "user16": "I\u2019m still standing. That\u2019s what we say, right? Doesn\u2019t mean the noise stops.",
  "system17": "Noise doesn\u2019t stop. You just stop feeding it.",
  "user17": "Easier said than done when it\u2019s been feeding off me for fifteen years.",
  "system18": "Fifteen years is done. You\u2019re here now. What do you want instead?",
  "user18": "I want to sleep through the damn night. Want Amanda to quit flinching when I move too fast. Want my kids to see me smile and believe it.",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully  \n2. Create safety for Amanda  \n3. Show my kids real joy  \n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "I don\u2019t know how to make those into\u2026 whatever you call them. Intentions. Sounds like paperwork for my soul."
