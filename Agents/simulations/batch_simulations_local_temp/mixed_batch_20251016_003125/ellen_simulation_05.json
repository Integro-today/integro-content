  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I have my ibogaine retreat coming up in Cancun this winter, and I keep thinking about what I want from it. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one opened something different. But this time feels... heavier somehow.\n\nI guess I'm hoping to finally understand what I'm supposed to do with everything I've built. All these years climbing, achieving, building companies... and now that I've sold everything, I feel this emptiness. Like I've been following the wrong map entirely.\n\nMy grandmother used to talk about \"tikkun olam\" - repairing the world. I think about her every day, especially since her passing. She had this quiet faith that I've somehow lost along the way.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what you're meant to do with everything you've built beyond achievement\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's grounded wisdom and faith\n3. Filling the emptiness that success didn't touch\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the three things that keep circling in my head at 5:30am when I'm supposed to be meditating but instead I'm making mental lists.\n\nIt's like... I know how to build things, scale things, make money. That's easy. But this? This feels like trying to learn a new language where I don't even know the alphabet.\n\nI want to believe there's something more than just the next venture capital deal, the next board meeting. My kids - they're 9 and 12 - they know me as the woman who gets things done, who solves problems. But they don't see me struggle with these bigger questions. Hell, I don't even know if my husband really gets it.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm just chasing another high - not drugs, but experiences. Like maybe I'm just addicted to transformation instead of actually transforming.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what I'm meant to build beyond achievement\n2. I reclaim the grounded faith my grandmother carried\n3. I become who my kids see when they really look at me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest - \"I discover what I'm meant to build beyond achievement.\" That's it exactly. I keep building, but for what? \n\nBut the third one... \"I become who my kids see when they really look at me\" - that one makes my chest tight. Because I think they see someone who's there but not *there*, you know? Physically present, checking my phone under the dinner table, taking calls during their school plays.\n\nThe faith one... I don't know if I'm ready to claim that. My grandmother's faith was so pure, so simple. She lived through so much and still had this quiet certainty. I feel like I'd be pretending if I said I could reclaim that. Maybe \"I explore the faith my grandmother carried\" instead? Less pressure.\n\nGod, I sound like I'm negotiating with myself. Classic.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I discover what I'm meant to build beyond achievement\n2. I explore the faith my grandmother carried  \n3. I become fully present when my kids need the real me\n\nHow do these land now?",
  "user3": "These feel... possible. Like I could actually hold them without them slipping through my fingers.\n\nThe second one feels better - \"explore\" instead of \"reclaim.\" I'm not there yet, but maybe I can start walking toward it without feeling like a fraud.\n\nThe third one though... \"when my kids need the real me\" - that cuts through all my bullshit. Because they do need me. And I want to be there. Not just physically, but really *there*. Not thinking about the next email or board meeting or whatever.\n\nI think these might work. They're honest, at least. Not some grand statement about saving the world or finding enlightenment. Just... the real work I need to do.\n\nShould I write them down somewhere? Keep them with me?",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I discover what I'm meant to build beyond achievement\n2. I explore the faith my grandmother carried\n3. I become fully present when my kids need the real me\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I... I don't know if I'm ready for this, but maybe that's the point.",
  "system5": "Nobody's ready. You just start walking.\n\nThe medicine works with what you bring. These intentions are enough.",
  "user5": "Yeah... I guess that's always been my thing, right? Waiting until I'm ready, until everything's perfect. But maybe that's just another way of staying stuck.\n\nI'll start walking.",
  "system6": "That's it. \n\nKeep walking.",
  "user6": "I will.",
  "system7": "Good.",
  "user7": "...I keep thinking about my grandmother. How she would just light candles on Friday nights and somehow that was enough. No metrics, no exit strategies, no board meetings. Just... faith that it mattered.\n\nI want to understand that. Really understand it, not just intellectualize it like I do everything else.\n\nI'm scared I won't find what I'm looking for. But I'm more scared of staying this version of myself - successful on paper, hollow everywhere else.\n\nSo yeah. I'll keep walking.",
  "system8": "She understood something about being human that you've been too busy to remember.\n\nThe hollowness isn't failure - it's just space that's been waiting for you to come home.\n\nKeep walking toward that Friday night simplicity.",
  "user8": "Space that's been waiting for me to come home...\n\nYeah. That's exactly what it feels like. Like I've been building and climbing and achieving to fill up something that doesn't want to be filled - it wants to be... opened. Or something. I don't know how to say it right.\n\nBut Friday night simplicity - I can hold that image. Candles and quiet and just being human without having to prove anything.\n\nI think I need to stop talking now. Just... walk toward that.",
  "system9": "That's the work.\n\nGo quiet with it.",
  "user9": "Yeah. I will.",
  "system10": "*The conversation settles into the quiet you've earned.*",
  "user10": "*Thank you.*",
  "system11": "You're welcome.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m still walking.",
  "system12": "Good.",
  "user12": "I'm here to help you craft intentions that feel alive for your upcoming Ibogaine journey. What feels most alive in you right now?",
  "system13": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user13": "I keep circling back to this feeling that I've been living someone else's definition of success. Like I've been performing this version of myself that everyone expects - the high achiever, the board member, the investor - but it's not... me. Not really.\n\nAnd I'm terrified that I'm going to waste whatever time I have left chasing the wrong things again. That I'll come back from this journey with all these insights and just... forget them. Like I always do.\n\nI want to know what I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life. Not in some grand, world-changing way. Just... what would feel like mine. What would feel like Friday night simplicity, every day.\n\nDoes that make any sense?",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop performing someone else's version of success\n2. Remember and live what actually matters beyond achievements\n3. Build a life that feels like Friday night simplicity every day\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "Yeah... those feel right. Especially that Friday night simplicity thing. That's what I want to chase.\n\nBut honestly? Part of me is scared that if I stop performing, there won't be anything underneath. Like maybe there IS no authentic me - just this hollow space where a person should be.\n\nSo these intentions... they feel huge. How do I even hold space for something that big without freaking out?",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I release the performance and discover what's already underneath\n2. I remember what matters when no one's watching\n3. I build my days around Friday night simplicity\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user15": "The second one... \"I remember what matters when no one's watching.\" That hits something. Because that's the thing - I've been so good at being who everyone needs me to be that I don't even know who I am when it's just... me.\n\nBut can I be honest? Saying \"I release the performance\" feels like I'm supposed to just... let go of everything I've built. And I don't want to throw it all away. I just want to stop feeling like I'm suffocating inside it.\n\nMaybe something like... \"I stop confusing the performance with the performer\" for the first one?\n\nAnd the third one... I keep thinking about my kids. How when we're at the park and I'm actually THERE with them, not checking email... that's Friday night simplicity. But then I ruin it by thinking about all the things I should be doing instead.\n\nI don't know. These feel closer, but still... I guess I'm scared that if I stop performing, I won't like what's underneath.",
  "system16": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I stop confusing the performance with the performer\n2. I remember what matters when no one's watching\n3. I choose presence with my kids over the shoulds\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user16": "They feel... terrifying. But also like they're pulling me forward somehow.\n\nThe third one especially. \"I choose presence with my kids over the shoulds.\" That's it. That's the thing I keep getting wrong. Yesterday I was helping my daughter with her homework and I literally picked up my phone mid-sentence because some investor email came through. The look on her face... she just went quiet and kept working. Like she's already learned that work comes first.\n\nThese intentions... they feel like they're about more than just me now. They're about who my kids see when they look at me. And maybe that's scarier than anything else - knowing they might be watching me figure this out.\n\nBut what if I mess it up? What if I set these intentions and then come back and just... forget? Like I always do.",
  "system17": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I stop confusing the performance with the performer\n2. I remember what matters when no one's watching  \n3. I choose presence with my kids over the shoulds\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. The medicine works even when you forget. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user17": "Okay. I'll... I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I don't know if I'm ready for this, but maybe that's the point.",
  "system18": "You're not supposed to feel ready. Just willing.\n\nThe medicine meets you where you are, not where you think you should be.",
  "user18": "That's... that's actually comforting. In a weird way.\n\nI've spent my whole life trying to be ready for everything. Trying to control every outcome. Maybe it's time to stop doing that.",
  "system19": "That realization is already part of the work.\n\nLet the need to be ready go. Just show up as you are.",
  "user19": "Just show up as I am. \n\nGod, I've been trying to figure out how to be perfect for this thing. Reading everything, trying to have the \"right\" intentions. Like there's some test I'm supposed to pass.\n\nBut you're saying... just be the mess I actually am?"
