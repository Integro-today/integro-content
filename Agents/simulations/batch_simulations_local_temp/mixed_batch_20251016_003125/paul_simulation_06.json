  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't really know how to do this. Heroic Hearts says I should set these intention things before I go to Costa Rica next month. \n\nI guess... I need to stop waking up screaming. Amanda's barely sleeping anymore because she's worried about me. And I can't keep pretending everything's fine when my kids hear me shouting at night.\n\nI don't want to lose her. That's what it comes down to.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without screaming\n2. Create safety for Amanda \n3. Stop pretending everything's fine\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that sounds about right. \n\nI need to figure out how to shut off whatever's happening in my head when I sleep. Been three years since I got out and it still feels like I'm back there sometimes. Amanda says I grab her arm like I'm holding onto the stick in the cockpit.\n\nI want her to feel safe again. I hate seeing that look on her face when she thinks I'm not watching - like she's walking on eggshells around me. She's the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm... I'm screwing it up.\n\nAnd I'm tired of the act. Tired of telling everyone at the VFW that I'm doing great when I can't even get through a full night's sleep without seeing the faces.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make Amanda feel safe again\n3. I drop the mask and face what haunts me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. Making Amanda feel safe again - that's the one that hits me in the gut. Everything else falls apart if I lose her.\n\nBut I don't know about \"peacefully.\" That word feels... I don't know. Too soft. Like something you'd see on a yoga poster or whatever. I need something stronger than that. Something that means I can close my eyes without seeing the explosions or hearing the radio calls. Something that means I don't wake up ready to fight.\n\nAnd the third one... \"drop the mask\" sounds right. That's exactly what it feels like - wearing something heavy that I can't take off. Even when I'm alone with my thoughts, I can't seem to get it off.",
  "system3": "How about:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the war following me\n2. I make Amanda feel safe again\n3. I take off the mask and face what haunts me\n\nBetter?",
  "user3": "Yeah. That's better. That first one - \"without the war following me\" - that's exactly what it feels like. Like it's trailing behind me everywhere I go, waiting for me to close my eyes.\n\nBut I still need to figure out what to say to Amanda. How to explain why I wake up like that. How to tell her it's not about her, it's about... everything else. She keeps asking what she can do to help and I don't have an answer because I don't even know what's wrong with me.\n\nI just want to be the man she married again. Not whatever this is.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the war following me\n2. I make Amanda feel safe again  \n3. I take off the mask and face what haunts me\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for helping me figure this out. I don't know what I'm walking into with this whole thing, but at least I know what I'm hoping to find on the other side.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine will work with what you've set.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Ready as I'll ever be, I guess. \n\nJust hope this plant stuff works better than the scotch does at shutting things up.",
  "system6": "It works differently. The scotch numbs. The medicine shows you what needs seeing.\n\nTrust where it takes you.",
  "user6": "Yeah... I've been pretty good at not seeing things. \n\nBut I can't keep doing this to Amanda. If this is what it takes, then... I guess I'm ready to see whatever's been hiding back there.",
  "system7": "That's the right reason. When you can't keep hurting someone you love, you're ready to face what you've been running from.\n\nTrust that.",
  "user7": "That's what keeps me up at night. Thinking about her face when I wake up shouting. The way she flinches sometimes when I move too fast. \n\nTwenty years in the service and I never felt fear like watching her watch me. Like she's seeing something in me that I can't see myself.",
  "system8": "She's seeing what the war left behind. What you can't see yet.\n\nThe medicine will show you both - what she sees, and what you've been protecting her from seeing.\n\nKeep breathing. You're doing this for the right reason.",
  "user8": "The war left something behind? \n\nI don't... I don't know about that. I did my job. Came home in one piece. That's more than a lot of guys can say.",
  "system9": "Coming home in one piece doesn't mean you brought all of yourself back.\n\nThe part that stayed sharp, stayed ready, stayed guarded - that part's still on patrol. That's what follows you into bed at night. That's what she sees.\n\nYou're not broken. You're still protecting something that doesn't need protecting anymore.",
  "user9": "I'm not... I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nI mean, I'm fine. I run my business, I provide for my family. Just cause I don't sleep great doesn't mean I'm still over there.",
  "system10": "You're right - you're here, running your business, providing. That's real.\n\nBut the part that checks exits, startles at loud noises, wakes up swinging - that's not about now. That's old training keeping you ready for a threat that's not in your bedroom.\n\nThe medicine will show you the difference between then and now.",
  "user10": "I'm not... I don't startle at loud noises. \n\nOkay, maybe sometimes. But that's just... that's just being alert. Better safe than sorry, right? Amanda understands that.",
  "system11": "She understands. But understanding isn't the same as feeling safe in her own home.\n\nThat's what this is about - not whether you're justified in being alert, but whether you can let yourself be at peace long enough for her to relax too.\n\nThe medicine will show you what being alert is costing both of you.",
  "user11": "I hate that she has to understand anything about this. She shouldn't have to know what it feels like to sleep next to someone who's always... on edge.\n\nMaybe that's what I need to see. What it's like being on the other side of me.",
  "system12": "That's exactly it. You need to see what she sees when she looks at you.\n\nThree threads:\n1. Sleep through the night without bringing the war to bed\n2. Create safety for Amanda in her own home\n3. Face what you've been protecting everyone from seeing\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user12": "I want to... I need to sleep without dragging her into whatever hell I'm visiting at night. That's first.\n\nAnd I need to stop making her feel like she's living with a loaded weapon. Make this house feel like home again, not a battlefield.\n\nThe last one... I don't know. What if I see something I can't come back from?",
  "system13": "The medicine won't show you anything you can't handle. But you're right to name that fear.\n\nBased on those threads:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make home safe for Amanda again\n3. I face what I've been protecting us from\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user13": "I want to change the first one. Not \"peacefully\" - that sounds like some yoga retreat crap.\n\nHow about \"I sleep through the night without dragging the war into our bed.\" That's real. That's what I need.\n\nThe second one... yeah. \"I make our home feel safe for Amanda again.\"\n\nThe last one still scares the hell out of me. But \"I face what I've been too afraid to look at\"... that feels right.",
  "system14": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without dragging the war into our bed\n2. I make our home feel safe for Amanda again\n3. I face what I've been too afraid to look at\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user14": "Alright. I'll keep them close. \n\nThank you... for not making me feel like I'm broken.",
  "system15": "You're not broken. You're carrying something heavy.\n\nThe intentions will help you set that weight down.",
  "user15": "I hope so. God, I hope so.",
  "system16": "Trust the work. The medicine knows what to do with what you've asked for.",
  "user16": "I'll try to trust it. That's all I can do, right?",
  "system17": "Exactly. Show up with these intentions. The medicine handles the rest.",
  "user17": "I'll be there. Three weeks.",
  "system18": "Three weeks. Keep these intentions where you'll see them daily. Let them settle in.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user18": "I'll see them every morning when I get up at 4:30. Same as always.\n\nI'm ready.",
  "system19": "Good. 4:30 it is.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user19": "Yeah. Been running in the dark for too long."
