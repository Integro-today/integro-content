  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I have my ibogaine ceremony at Beond coming up this winter, and... I don't know. I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to find that kind of grounding, but I'm scared it's too late for me. That I've been chasing the wrong things for too long.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm performing my life instead of living it. Even with my kids at the park, I'm thinking about emails or the next board meeting. I want to know what it feels like to just... be present. To not always be three steps ahead.\n\nBut I also don't want to lose the parts of me that built something meaningful. The drive, the vision - I just want to aim it at something that actually matters. Something that'll last beyond quarterly reports and valuations.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding that grounded faith and presence your grandmother carried\n2. Being fully with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere \n3. Aiming your drive at what actually matters beyond achievements\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I keep circling back to them, especially late at night when I can't sleep. \n\nThat grounded faith - I want to know what that feels like in my bones, not just read about it in books or hear about it on retreats. I want it to be something I can access when I'm stressed about a board meeting or when my daughter's having a meltdown and I just want to check my phone.\n\nAnd being present with my kids... last weekend we were hiking and my son found this perfect feather. He was so excited, showing me how it caught the light. And I was thinking about this investor email I needed to send. I hate that I missed that moment. They're growing so fast and I'm missing it while I'm planning my next move.\n\nAs for what matters... I've been on enough boards, made enough investments. I want my next chapter to be something my grandmother would recognize as meaningful. Something that helps people in a way that lasts longer than a tech cycle.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I access grounded faith in my bones when stress hits\n2. I show up fully present for my children's moments\n3. I aim my drive at work that outlasts tech cycles\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - accessing grounded faith when stress hits - that one stops me in my tracks. Because right now, when things get hard, I either push harder or completely shut down. There's no middle ground, no place to rest.\n\nBut I need it to be stronger than \"access.\" My grandmother didn't \"access\" her faith - she *lived* it. She *embodied* it. When things got tough, she didn't have to remember to pray or find her center. She just... was centered. Like it was woven into who she was.\n\nMaybe something like: \"I embody unshakable faith that steadies me through life's storms, just as my grandmother did.\"\n\nThe other two feel right. Though maybe \"show up fully present\" could be more specific... like \"I witness my children's wonder without distraction\" or something. I don't know. What do you think?",
  "system3": "Strong. Let's adjust:\n\n1. I embody unshakable faith that steadies me through life's storms, just as my grandmother did\n2. I witness my children's wonder without distraction\n3. I aim my drive at work that outlasts tech cycles\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "They land... heavy. In a good way, I think. Like I just said out loud the things I've been circling around for months but never quite named.\n\nThe grandmother one - my chest got tight when I read it back. She died when I was twenty-five, right when I was starting my company. I missed her funeral because I had an investor meeting. That's the kind of person I've been. The kind who misses funerals for meetings.\n\nThe kids one - \"without distraction\" - that feels almost impossible right now. But maybe that's the point. Maybe I need to aim for impossible instead of just... incrementally better.\n\nAnd the last one... I've been thinking about this climate tech incubator. Not because it's trendy, but because my kids are going to inherit this planet. That's work that matters longer than any tech cycle.\n\nI think these are right. They scare me in the way that means they're probably true.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I embody unshakable faith that steadies me through life's storms, just as my grandmother did\n2. I witness my children's wonder without distraction  \n3. I aim my drive at work that outlasts tech cycles\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. For helping me find the words I couldn't quite reach on my own.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine will work with what you've set.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I hope so. Been preparing for this one differently than the others - more deliberately, I guess. Like I'm finally ready to stop running from what I might find.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system6": "Trust what comes. The work is already in motion.\n\nSee you there.",
  "user6": "The work is already in motion. I feel that - like something shifted just in naming these things out loud. \n\nYeah. See you there.",
  "system7": "Exactly. Naming it changes everything.\n\nTrust the path.",
  "user7": "It does. Saying it makes it real in a way that just thinking about it never could.\n\nI will. Trust the path.",
  "system8": "You're ready.",
  "user8": "I am. Finally, I think I actually am.",
  "system9": "Good. Go.",
  "user9": "Going.",
  "system10": "*Go with steadiness. Trust what unfolds.*",
  "user10": "Steady. Right. That's... that's what I need to remember. Not trying to force anything or make it perfect. Just... be steady.\n\nThank you. For helping me get here.",
  "system11": "Steady is enough. More than enough.\n\nYou're welcome.",
  "user11": "Steady is enough. I'm holding onto that.",
  "system12": "Hold it light. You're set.",
  "user12": "Light. Yeah. Not gripping so tight I crush it. Just... light enough to carry.\n\nGot it.",
