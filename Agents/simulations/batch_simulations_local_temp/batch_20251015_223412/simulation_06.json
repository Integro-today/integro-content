  "system0": "I have an ibogaine ceremony coming up at Beond in a few weeks, and honestly, I'm hoping this one finally sticks. I've done the ayahuasca, the psilocybin, the MDMA journeys... each time I come back feeling transformed, but then three months later I'm waking up at 5:30 again, mainlining coffee, checking stock prices, and wondering what the hell I'm doing with my life. I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything, and I can't shake the feeling that I abandoned something important when I chased all those business wins.",
  "user0": "I hear the exhaustion of someone who's done the work over and over, yet finds themselves back in the same empty patterns. That 5:30 AM wake-up and stock-checking sounds like it's become a symbol of everything you never wanted to become.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your ibogaine journey - it helps point you toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. Given how ibogaine often works with addiction patterns (even to achievement/status), having clear intentions can help guide the deep rewiring it offers.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're really hoping to heal or reclaim. Together we'll build intentions that address this cycle of transformation that keeps slipping away.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works specifically with ibogaine, given its unique properties for rewiring patterns.\n\nWhich feels right to start with?",
  "system1": "God, I hate that you called it an addiction pattern - but you're right, aren't you? That's exactly what this is. I keep chasing these hits of... something... achievement, recognition, whatever's next on the checklist. And then I'm hollow again.\n\nLet's do Option A. I need to figure out what the hell I'm actually trying to heal here, because clearly whatever I've been doing isn't working. I keep thinking if I just find the right medicine, the right ceremony, the right integration practice, then suddenly I'll become the person I keep glimpsing in those journeys - the one who knows what matters, who's connected to something bigger than quarterly earnings and board meetings.\n\nBut maybe that's just another achievement trap I'm setting for myself.",
  "user1": "That self-awareness is sharp - recognizing how even the search for healing can become another performance, another thing to \"win\" at. It's painful when you see how deep that pattern runs.\n\nSo let's step back. Before we chase the next thing - what brought you to this ibogaine ceremony specifically? What made you choose this medicine over going back to the others?",
  "system2": "I keep thinking about what my grandmother would say - she had this way of seeing right through me when I was performing versus when I was actually present. She'd probably tell me I'm doing it again, wouldn't she?\n\nI chose ibogaine because... honestly, because I'm desperate. The other medicines gave me beautiful experiences, these profound moments of connection. But ibogaine has this reputation for being... well, brutal. Like it doesn't care about your comfort or your carefully constructed identity. I've heard it strips everything down to the bone, shows you exactly who you are without all the noise.\n\nI'm tired of these gentle insights that fade. I need something that's going to force me to see why I keep building these impressive sandcastles that dissolve the moment I try to live in them. Maybe if something shakes me hard enough, I'll finally understand why all this success feels like someone else's life.",
  "user2": "There's something raw in admitting you want the brutal truth - that gentle insights haven't been enough to stop you from building those sandcastles. Your grandmother would probably appreciate that honesty about wanting to be shaken awake.\n\nSo here's what I'm hearing: you want to understand why you keep constructing these impressive but uninhabitable lives. What do you think you're actually building with all these achievements? When you're checking those stock prices at 5:30 AM, what are you really trying to measure or prove?",
  "system3": "That's... that's the question that keeps me up at night, isn't it? When I'm checking those numbers before dawn, what am I actually measuring?\n\nI think I'm trying to prove that I matter. That I'm not just the granddaughter of immigrants who barely spoke English, that I've justified their sacrifice. That I'm worthy of the space I take up in the world. Every acquisition, every board seat, every article about me - it's like I'm building this fortress of credentials so nobody can ever question my value again.\n\nBut then I look at my kids, and they don't give a damn about any of it. They just want me to put my phone down and play with them. And I keep thinking - what if I spent the same energy building something that actually matters? What if instead of proving I'm important, I just... was important? To them, to my community, to something bigger than my portfolio?\n\nI don't even know what that looks like anymore.",
  "user3": "That moment when you see your kids just wanting you present - that's where the fortress starts to feel like a prison, isn't it? All those credentials you've built to prove you matter, and the people who matter most just want your attention.\n\nTell me about this grandmother of yours. You said she had that quiet faith that carried her through everything. What do you imagine she'd see when she looked at you now? Not the judgment version, but the real seeing - what would she recognize in you that you've forgotten how to recognize in yourself?",
  "system4": "She would see... she would see the little girl who used to sit in her kitchen while she made challah, singing these old songs in Yiddish. I didn't understand the words, but I felt them, you know? She had this way of being completely present - like when she was with you, there was nowhere else she needed to be.\n\nShe'd probably smile at all my achievements and say \"that's nice, bubeleh, but when are you going to stop running?\" She used to tell me stories about how her family came here with nothing, but they had each other, they had their community, they had their faith. That was enough. She'd bake bread for neighbors who were struggling, she'd sit with the sick, she knew everyone's name at temple.\n\nI think she'd see that I've become so afraid of having \"nothing\" that I've forgotten how to just... be with people. How to be part of something without trying to lead it or fund it or optimize it. She'd probably take one look at me and know that I'm exhausted from trying to earn my place in a world where she already knew I belonged just by existing.",
  "user4": "That image of her in the kitchen, being completely present with you while the bread rose - that's so different from checking stock prices before dawn. She knew something about belonging that didn't need to be earned or proven.\n\nWhat do you think she was trying to teach you in those moments? When she was singing in Yiddish and you felt the words without understanding them, what was she passing down that wasn't about achievement or proving anything?\n\nAnd here's the harder question: if she could see you now, what do you think she'd want you to reclaim from that little girl in her kitchen?",
  "system5": "She was teaching me that some things are sacred just because they exist. The bread rising, the songs carrying stories across oceans, the way time stops when you're really with someone. She wasn't trying to make me into anything - she was just letting me be there, in the warmth, in the rhythm of something ancient and ongoing.\n\nI think she'd want me to reclaim that knowing. That I don't have to earn my place at the table. That there's wisdom in just being present with what's in front of me. That some things can't be optimized or accelerated - they just need to be lived.\n\nShe'd probably tell me to stop trying to be impressive and just be honest. To remember that the little girl who sang those songs knew something about connection that I've been too busy to remember.",
  "user5": "That wisdom feels so different from the world you've built - where everything can be optimized, accelerated, measured. She was teaching you about sacred time versus productivity time.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. The exhaustion of constantly proving your worth through achievements that never quite satisfy\n2. A longing to reclaim that \"knowing\" - that you belong just by existing, like that little girl in the kitchen\n3. Wanting to move from building impressive sandcastles to actually inhabiting your life with presence\n\nDoes that capture what matters most as you head into this ibogaine ceremony?",
  "system6": "Yes. Yes, that's exactly it. You just named the thing I couldn't quite articulate - sacred time versus productivity time. That's what I've been missing, isn't it? I've been trying to optimize the sacred, make it more efficient, more measurable, more... successful.\n\nThose three threads - they're all tangled up in how I've been living. The proving, the forgetting I belong, building things I can't actually live in. I keep thinking if I can just achieve enough, I'll finally feel like I deserve to slow down and be present. But that moment never comes.\n\nI want ibogaine to help me see what's underneath all this frantic building. What's left of me when I stop trying to be impressive and just... am.",
  "user6": "That recognition - that you've been trying to optimize the sacred - feels like the key that might unlock everything. When you stop trying to make presence more efficient, what emerges?\n\nBased on those three threads, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. \"I open myself to reclaiming my inherent belonging, beyond what I achieve or prove\"\n2. \"I seek to understand what drives my endless building, and what needs to be released\"\n3. \"I welcome the wisdom to distinguish between sacred time and productivity time, learning to inhabit each fully\"\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly? Or would you like to craft something different that feels more like your own words?",
  "system7": "The second one - \"I seek to understand what drives my endless building, and what needs to be released\" - that one hits me in the chest. Because I don't just want to understand it, I want to be free of it. I want to know why I keep constructing these elaborate proofs of my worth when what I actually crave is so much simpler.\n\nBut I need it to be in my voice, not this... therapy-speak. Something like... \"Help me see why I keep building monuments to myself when what I really want is to just sit at the kitchen table and know I'm home.\" Or maybe just... \"Show me what's underneath all this achievement. What's left when I stop trying to matter so much.\"\n\nI don't know. Maybe that's too soft. But I want to understand what I'm so afraid of that I keep armoring myself with accomplishments instead of just... being a person.",
  "user7": "\"Show me what's underneath all this achievement. What's left when I stop trying to matter so much.\" \n\nThat feels powerful - direct, honest, in your voice. How does that feel as your first intention?\n\nFor the second one, what about something like: \"Help me see what I'm so terrified of that I'd rather build monuments than just be a person at the table\" - does that capture the fear underneath all this building?",
  "system8": "Yes. That first one - \"Show me what's underneath all this achievement. What's left when I stop trying to matter so much\" - that feels like the truth. It's almost embarrassing how simple it is, but that's what I need to know.\n\nAnd the second one about being terrified... I want to soften it just a bit. Not because it's wrong, but because I need to be gentle enough with myself to actually look at it. Maybe: \"Help me see what I'm afraid to face that keeps me building instead of just being at the table.\"\n\nBecause I think the terror is real, but I also think there's something else - maybe grief? All those years spent proving instead of living... what did I miss while I was so busy becoming someone important?",
  "user8": "\"Help me see what I'm afraid to face that keeps me building instead of just being at the table\" - that's beautiful. It has both the honesty and the gentleness you need to actually look.\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"Show me what's underneath all this achievement. What's left when I stop trying to matter so much\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"Help me see what I'm afraid to face that keeps me building instead of just being at the table\"\n\nFor your third intention - what about that grief you mentioned? The missing years spent proving instead of living? \"Help me grieve what I missed while I was becoming someone important, so I can reclaim what actually matters\" - does that capture the third piece?",
  "system9": "Yes. That third one - the grief piece - that's important. But I want to add something to it. Because it's not just about grieving what I missed. It's about what I can still reclaim while there's time.\n\nHow about: \"Help me grieve what I missed while I was becoming someone important, and show me what's still here waiting for me to come home to.\"\n\nBecause maybe my kids are still young enough to want me present. Maybe my husband is still waiting for the real me to show up. Maybe that little girl in my grandmother's kitchen is still here, somewhere underneath all the noise.",
  "user9": "\"Help me grieve what I missed while I was becoming someone important, and show me what's still here waiting for me to come home to.\"\n\nThat feels complete - the grief and the hope, the loss and what can still be reclaimed.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"Help me grieve what I missed while I was becoming someone important, and show me what's still here waiting for me to come home to\"\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\n- Write them in your journal where you track your life\n- Record yourself reading them so you can hear your own voice\n- Keep them on a card near where you check your phone in the morning\n- Create a small ritual with something that connects to your grandmother - maybe when you make coffee, take a breath and read them\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when the achievement voice gets loud again?",
  "system10": "I'll write them down. In my journal - the leather one I bought in Costa Rica after my first ayahuasca ceremony. It's got coffee stains and plane tickets pressed between pages, but it feels like the right home for these.\n\nAnd maybe... in the kitchen? On a small card near where I make my coffee at 5:30am, when the house is quiet and I'm most likely to forget everything that matters while I check my phone. That way, every morning when I reach for my caffeine fix and my screen, I have to see these questions first.\n\nThe achievement voice gets loudest in those early hours - before anyone else is awake, when it's just me and the possibility of the day. If I can interrupt that pattern, even for a moment... maybe I can change the whole rhythm.\n\nI'll keep them simple. Just the three statements. Nothing fancy.",
  "user10": "That feels perfect - the journal that already holds your journey, and the kitchen counter where you first learned about sacred time. Those 5:30am moments when possibility feels like pressure instead of peace.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this ibogaine ceremony:\n\n1. \"Show me what's underneath all this achievement. What's left when I stop trying to matter so much\"\n\n2. \"Help me see what I'm afraid to face that keeps me building instead of just being at the table\"\n\n3. \"Help me grieve what I missed while I was becoming someone important, and show me what's still here waiting for me to come home to\"\n\nYour chosen ritual: Written in your Costa Rica journal and on a small card near your coffee maker - interrupting that 5:30am achievement voice before it takes over.\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The ibogaine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you courage on this journey - especially the courage to stop building and start belonging.",
  "system11": "Thank you. Really. This feels... I don't know. Like I finally said the true thing instead of the impressive thing. \n\nThe funny thing is, I have no idea what \"belonging\" even looks like anymore. But maybe that's what I'm supposed to find out. What's underneath all this noise I've been making.\n\nI'll keep these close. And when I get scared - because I know I will - I'll remember that little girl in my grandmother's kitchen, just sitting there, knowing she was home.",
  "user11": "That little girl in your grandmother's kitchen - she knew something you've forgotten. The ibogaine will help you remember what home feels like when you're not trying to earn your place there.\n\nYou've done brave work today - saying the true thing instead of the impressive thing. That muscle will serve you well when the medicine asks you to keep being honest.\n\nHold onto that confusion about what belonging looks like. Sometimes \"I don't know\" is the most honest place to start.\n\nSafe travels. May you find your way back to that kitchen table.",
  "system12": "Thank you. I... yeah. I needed this more than I realized.",
  "user12": "I hear you. Sometimes we don't know how much we've needed to speak the truth until we finally do.\n\nYou're ready for this journey - not because you have answers, but because you're willing to ask real questions. That's enough.\n\nBe gentle with yourself.",
  "system13": "I will. And thank you for helping me find the questions underneath all the answers I've been carrying around.",
  "user13": "Those answers get heavy after a while, don't they? All that certainty we carry to prove we matter.\n\nI'm honored you let me help you set them down for a moment and find what's been underneath all along.\n\nYour questions will carry you further than your answers ever could.",
  "system14": "They really do get heavy. I didn't realize I was carrying so much until we started setting some of it down.\n\nI'll try to remember that - that questions can be enough. That maybe I've been carrying the wrong things all this time.",
  "user14": "That's the gift of this work - realizing that what you've been carrying was never yours to hold in the first place.\n\nMay the ibogaine help you set down even more. And may you remember that questions don't need to be carried - they just need to be asked.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "system15": "Thank you. For seeing through all the noise to what was actually true. I'll carry that with me - that someone could see the real question underneath all my impressive answers.",
  "user15": "The real question was there all along - you just gave it space to speak. That's your own wisdom, not mine.\n\nTrust what emerges when you stop trying to be impressive. That voice knows the way home.\n\nGo gently into this work. The truth is already waiting for you.",
  "system16": "Thank you. For helping me hear my own voice underneath all the noise. I'll try to trust it.",
  "user16": "That's all any of us can do - keep learning to trust that quiet voice underneath the noise. You've already found it once today.\n\nHold that lightly as you go into the medicine. Your voice will be there when you need it.\n\nWishing you courage and truth on your journey.",
  "system17": "I will. Thank you for helping me find it again.",
  "user17": "You held space for your own voice to emerge\u2014that\u2019s no small thing. I just walked beside you while you did the real work.\n\nMay the medicine deepen what you\u2019ve already begun to hear.",
  "system18": "Thank you. For walking beside me while I found my way back to myself.",
  "user18": "That\u2019s the beautiful thing\u2014none of us walk these paths alone. You did the brave work of turning inward; I simply kept pace.\n\nYour courage brought you home.",
  "system19": "I didn\u2019t feel brave. Just... tired of pretending. But maybe that\u2019s where courage starts.",
  "user19": "Exactly. Courage rarely feels heroic\u2014it usually feels like exhaustion with the mask you\u2019ve been wearing. When pretending costs more than showing up as you are, that\u2019s when the real work begins."
