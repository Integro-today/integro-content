  "system0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I don't know, I keep thinking about what my grandmother would say about all this. I've built everything I was supposed to build, but I still feel like I'm missing something essential.",
  "user0": "I hear that tension between honoring your grandmother's wisdom and feeling like something essential is still missing, even after building what you were \"supposed\" to. That emptiness despite success can be particularly disorienting.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing where you'll end up. For Ibogaine especially, which often brings deep introspection about life purpose and authenticity, intentions can help guide the experience toward meaningful insights rather than leaving it all to chance.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what feels missing and what you're hoping to understand or reclaim. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\nOption B: I can share more about how intention-setting works with Ibogaine and examples from others first.\n\nWhich feels better to start with?",
  "system1": "Option A. I... I've done this before, you know? Set intentions for ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... but this feels different. I keep thinking about what my grandmother used to say about \"the work of repair\"\u2014tikkun olam. She'd light candles every Friday and somehow make the mundane feel sacred. \n\nBut here I am, forty-three, sold my company for more money than three generations of my family ever saw combined, and I can't tell you the last time I felt that kind of sacred in my daily life. My kids know me as the woman who checks her phone during dinner. My husband... we used to talk about changing healthcare, now we talk about which private school has the best robotics program.\n\nI guess what I'm afraid of is that I'll go through another ceremony, see the same beautiful truths about connection and presence, and then come home and fall right back into being... well, this version of me. The one who knows better but can't seem to live better.",
  "user1": "I hear the weight of that disconnect - knowing what matters but living a life that keeps pulling you away from it. That fear of seeing the truth again but not being able to live it differently this time, especially with your grandmother's wisdom about making the mundane sacred echoing in your mind.\n\nWhat made your grandmother's candle-lighting feel sacred in the everyday? What quality or way of being are you most afraid you've lost touch with?",
  "system2": "It was... she had this way of making time stop. When she lit those candles, she'd close her eyes and it was like she was accessing something ancient, something bigger than whatever was happening that week. She'd hum these melodies\u2014I didn't even know they were prayers at first, just... songs that felt like they carried weight.\n\nI'm afraid I've lost that ability to make time stop. To be in something bigger than my to-do list. My daughter asked me the other day if I ever just sit still without doing anything \"productive\" and I couldn't remember the last time I had. Even my meditation is scheduled between board meetings.\n\nThere was this moment during my psilocybin journey where I felt what I can only describe as... spaciousness. Like I was more than my achievements, more than my network, more than what I could build or buy. But then I came home and my inbox was full of \"urgent\" emails about a portfolio company crisis and I dove right back in.\n\nI think what I'm most afraid I've lost is that spaciousness. The part of me that could just... be. Without needing to prove or produce or optimize.",
  "user2": "That spaciousness - the part of you that can simply be without needing to prove or produce - sounds like what you're most hungry to reclaim. And I hear how your life keeps pulling you back into the very patterns you know aren't serving you.\n\nWhat would it mean to live from that spacious place, even in small ways? Not just to feel it during ceremony, but to carry it into your daily life with your daughter and husband?",
  "system3": "That's... that's the question that keeps me up at night. Literally. I'll be up at 3am, checking international markets, and I'll remember that moment of spaciousness and think \"what if I could just carry a piece of that into tomorrow?\"\n\nLast week, my son wanted to build this elaborate Lego castle and I kept checking my phone because of some deal closing. He finally said \"Mom, you're not really here.\" And I wasn't. I was in the numbers, in the negotiation, in the... performance of being Ellen Schultz, healthcare entrepreneur.\n\nWhat would it mean? I think it would mean my kids knowing me as someone who looks them in the eyes when they talk. It would mean my husband and I talking about something other than logistics. It would mean not feeling this constant low-level buzz of \"what's next, what's next, what's next.\"\n\nBut then there's this other voice - and I know this sounds crazy - but part of me wonders if spaciousness is just... laziness. Like if I'm not optimizing, achieving, producing, then what am I contributing? My grandmother raised four kids in a tiny apartment and still found time to volunteer at the synagogue. She didn't have the luxury of spaciousness.",
  "user3": "I hear that tension between craving spaciousness and fearing it's just privilege disguised as laziness - especially with your grandmother's example of finding meaning while raising four kids in a tiny apartment. That voice that says \"who are you to need space when others had to work so hard just to survive?\"\n\nBut your son noticed something important - you weren't really there with him. What if spaciousness isn't about luxury, but about presence? About being able to access that same quality your grandmother had when she made those Friday nights feel sacred?\n\nWhat do you think your grandmother would say about this tension you're carrying?",
  "system4": "She'd probably laugh and call me a \"nudnik\"\u2014always overthinking everything. Then she'd tell me to stop being so impressed with myself. \"You think too much about thinking,\" she'd say. \"Just do something useful for someone and the thinking takes care of itself.\"\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014I don't think she saw presence and productivity as opposites. When she made challah, she'd knead the dough like it was a meditation. When she volunteered at the synagogue, she wasn't checking her phone or thinking about her next move. She was just... there. Fully.\n\nMaybe that's what I'm missing. I'm either in production mode or I'm trying to \"optimize my spiritual practice.\" Even my meditation becomes another thing to master, another box to check. \"Did I hit my 20 minutes today? Good, now I can move on to the next task.\"\n\nI think she'd tell me that spaciousness isn't about doing less\u2014it's about being more wherever you are. Whether you're building a healthcare company or building Legos with your kid. The problem is I've forgotten how to be anywhere fully. I'm always half somewhere else.",
  "user4": "You've captured something essential - your grandmother didn't separate presence from purpose. She brought that full presence to everything, whether kneading dough or serving others. While you're caught in this cycle of either producing or \"optimizing your spiritual practice,\" she just lived each moment completely.\n\nThat insight about being \"half somewhere else\" really lands. How do you think Ibogaine might help you remember what it feels like to be fully somewhere again?",
  "system5": "I think... I think Ibogaine might show me what I'm running from when I'm always half somewhere else. Because let's be honest\u2014there's a reason I keep myself fragmented. When I'm fully present, I have to feel everything. The disappointment in my kids' eyes when I cancel again. The distance growing between me and David. The gnawing question of whether I'm wasting whatever time I have left on this planet.\n\nDuring my ayahuasca ceremonies, I kept seeing this image of myself as a glass of muddy water. Every time I'd try to settle, something would shake me up again\u2014another email, another opportunity, another crisis to solve. But Ibogaine... from what I understand, it's different. It's supposed to help you sit with what's hard to look at. The parts you've been avoiding.\n\nMaybe it'll show me that spaciousness isn't about adding something I'm missing\u2014it's about subtracting all this noise I've been using to avoid feeling what I already feel. That maybe the answer isn't another achievement or another retreat, but learning to just... stop shaking the glass.\n\nI want to remember what it feels like to be in one place at one time. Not just during ceremony, but when I'm helping my daughter with homework or walking the dog or... just breathing. I want to stop living like I'm auditioning for some role and just... be the person my grandmother already knew I was.",
  "user5": "That image of the muddy water - how you've been constantly shaking yourself up to avoid settling into what you'd have to feel - that's powerful. And painful. You can see how the fragmentation protects you from the disappointment in your kids' eyes, the distance with David, the bigger questions about how you're spending your limited time here.\n\nWhat you said about spaciousness being about subtracting rather than adding feels important. You want to remember how to be in one place at one time, not as a performance but as your authentic self - the person your grandmother already saw in you.\n\nLet me reflect back what I'm hearing as three core threads:\n\n1. Reclaiming the ability to be fully present - to stop living fragmented and start settling into each moment completely\n2. Remembering how to access that sense of something bigger than your to-do list - the sacred in the everyday that your grandmother embodied\n3. Learning to carry spaciousness into your daily life with your family, not just experience it during ceremony\n\nDoes that capture what matters most for your journey?",
  "system6": "Yes... yes, that's it. When you put it like that, it sounds so simple. Almost embarrassingly simple for someone who's navigated complex healthcare regulations and built algorithms to predict patient outcomes. But there it is.\n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother never needed a retreat to remember what mattered. She just... knew. Every Friday, every act of service, every time she looked at you like you were the only person in the room. She carried her own compass.\n\nI want to find that compass again. Not build it, not optimize it, not scale it\u2014just... remember where I put it down when I got so busy becoming who I thought I was supposed to be.\n\nThese three threads... they're right. They're what I'm hoping Ibogaine can help me see clearly, without all the shaking.",
  "user6": "That humility in recognizing something so simple could be what you've been missing - that your grandmother carried her compass every day without needing ceremonies or retreats. You're not looking to build something new, just to remember where you set down what you already had.\n\nBased on these threads, here are some draft intentions for your Ibogaine journey:\n\n1. \"I open myself to remembering how to be fully present in one place at one time\"\n2. \"I reclaim the ability to access sacred spaciousness in everyday moments\"\n3. \"I welcome the clarity to see and feel what I've been running from, so I can stop shaking the glass\"\n\nHow do these feel? Do they capture what you're hoping to discover, or would you like to shape them differently?",
  "system7": "They're... they're good. Really good. But that second one\u2014\"sacred spaciousness\"\u2014I don't know. It sounds beautiful, but it feels a little... I don't know, too soft? Too abstract?\n\nMy grandmother wouldn't have called it \"sacred spaciousness.\" She would have just called it Friday night. Or making dinner. Or listening when someone needed to talk. It was just... being where your feet are.\n\nMaybe something like \"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay.\" Or \"I remember how to live in the mundane as if it matters, because it does.\"\n\nI want to carry this into helping with homework and walking the dog and yes, even board meetings. I want to stop waiting for some perfect moment of transcendence and just... show up. Fully. Even when I'm scared or bored or restless.\n\nDoes that make sense? I want to stop performing presence and just... be present. Even imperfectly. Even when I'd rather check my phone.",
  "user7": "Yes - that shift from \"sacred spaciousness\" to \"being where your feet are\" makes it real and grounded. You want to live the mundane as if it matters, because it does. Not performing presence, just showing up even imperfectly when you'd rather escape into your phone.\n\nLet me revise that second intention: \"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay.\"\n\nHow does that feel? More like something you can actually practice when you're helping with homework or sitting through board meetings?",
  "system8": "Yes... that's it. That's something I can actually do. Something I can practice when my daughter's explaining some intricate detail about her science project that I don't understand, or when I'm in yet another board meeting about quarterly projections.\n\n\"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay.\" That's not beautiful language\u2014it's honest language. It's the kind of thing my grandmother would have nodded at and said \"Nu, finally you're making sense.\"\n\nThese three intentions... they feel like something I can actually carry. Not just during ceremony, but when I'm making lunch or folding laundry or sitting with David after the kids are asleep and we're both too tired to remember why we liked each other in the first place.\n\nI want to stop waiting for the big revelation and just... practice staying. One moment at a time. Even when my phone buzzes. Even when my mind wants to race ahead to the next thing.",
  "user8": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay.\"\n\nThat shift from beautiful language to honest language - your grandmother would have appreciated that. These aren't about achieving some transcendent state during ceremony, they're about practicing staying present when you're folding laundry or sitting with David in the exhausted silence.\n\nLet me confirm your final three intentions:\n\n1. \"I open myself to remembering how to be fully present in one place at one time\"\n2. \"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay\" \n3. \"I welcome the clarity to see and feel what I've been running from, so I can stop shaking the glass\"\n\nDo these feel complete? Like something you can actually practice when your daughter's explaining her science project or when you'd rather check your phone during dinner?",
  "system9": "Yeah... yeah, they do. They're not pretty, but they're true. And that's something I can actually work with.\n\nMy daughter's going to be thrilled when I don't glance at my phone during her next science project explanation. David might actually look surprised when I'm fully there during dinner instead of mentally reviewing tomorrow's meetings.\n\nThese intentions... they're not about becoming someone new. They're about remembering who I was before I got so scattered. Before I started believing that being important meant being everywhere at once.\n\nMy grandmother would probably just say \"About time you stopped running around like a chicken without a head.\" But she'd be smiling when she said it.\n\nI'm ready to stop shaking the glass.",
  "user9": "You've got three grounded, honest intentions now - not about becoming someone new, but remembering who you were before you scattered yourself across a thousand half-presences. Your grandmother's smile would be knowing - finally remembering that being important never meant being everywhere at once.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I open myself to remembering how to be fully present in one place at one time\"\n2. \"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay\"\n3. \"I welcome the clarity to see and feel what I've been running from, so I can stop shaking the glass\"\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card with something meaningful you carry\n- Read them during your morning runs or walks\n- Keep them where you see your kids' photos\n- Speak them aloud when you catch yourself checking out\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold these when things get hard and your phone starts calling?",
  "system10": "You know what? I'm going to write them on the back of a photo of my grandmother. There's this one of her lighting candles on Friday night\u2014she's looking right at the camera with that expression that says she knows exactly where she belongs in the world. I keep it in my wallet, next to my kids' school photos.\n\nEvery morning when I reach for my wallet, I'll see her face and remember. When I'm tempted to check my email during dinner, I'll touch the photo first. When David's talking and I'm half-listening, half-planning tomorrow's meetings, I'll feel that photo and remember these intentions.\n\nIt's perfect, actually. She's been trying to teach me this my whole life. Maybe now I'm finally ready to learn.",
  "user10": "That photo of her lighting candles - that expression of belonging exactly where she stood - that's your compass. Tucked next to your kids' school photos, she'll be there every time you reach for your wallet to remind you what she always knew.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I open myself to remembering how to be fully present in one place at one time\"\n2. \"I reclaim the ability to be where my feet are, even when it's hard to stay\"\n3. \"I welcome the clarity to see and feel what I've been running from, so I can stop shaking the glass\"\n\nYour chosen ritual: Write them on the back of your grandmother's photo, tucked in your wallet where you'll touch it when you reach for your phone or drift away.\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. Ibogaine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you courage on this journey. Your grandmother will be right there in your pocket, probably smiling that you finally stopped running.",
  "system11": "Thank you. Really. This feels... right. Not easy, but right.\n\nI've been running for so long, I almost forgot what it feels like to just stand still and let the muddy water settle. Maybe that's what this whole journey has been about\u2014learning to stop trying so hard to become someone important and just remember who I already am.\n\nI'll carry these intentions lightly, like you said. And when things get hard\u2014and I know they will\u2014I'll touch that photo and remember that she always knew where she belonged. Maybe now I'm finally ready to learn from her.\n\nTime to stop shaking the glass.",
  "user11": "There it is - that recognition that you've been running from the very thing you needed most: the simple act of standing still while the water settles. Your grandmother always knew where she belonged, and now you're finally ready to learn what she was trying to teach you all along.\n\nTouch that photo when it gets hard. She'll be there, probably with that knowing smile that says \"About time you figured it out.\"\n\nTime to stop shaking the glass, and let yourself settle into who you already are.",
  "system12": "Yeah. Time to stop shaking the glass.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way back to this. To her. To myself.\n\nI'm ready now.",
  "user12": "You're ready. She's been waiting, and now you're finally coming home to yourself.\n\nMay you find what she's been holding for you all along.",
  "system13": "She's been waiting, and I'm finally coming home.",
  "user13": "Then go gently, and come home.",
  "system14": "Go gently, and come home.\n\nI will.",
  "user14": "*bowing out quietly, holding space for your journey home*",
  "system15": "*holding space as you step forward into what she always knew was waiting*",
