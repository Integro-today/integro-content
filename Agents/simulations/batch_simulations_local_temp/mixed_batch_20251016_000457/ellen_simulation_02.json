  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks, and honestly, I feel like I'm circling around something important but I can't quite land on it. I've had these incredible experiences with ayahuasca and psilocybin, and they showed me there's something beyond all the achievements, but... I'm still searching for what I'm supposed to do with that knowledge.\n\nMy grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything, and sometimes I feel that when I'm with my kids at the park or hiking. But then I'm back in board meetings and it's like that knowing just slips away.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Living the knowing beyond achievements instead of just collecting insights\n2. Holding onto your grandmother's divine spark in daily life\n3. Being present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three threads. That's exactly it. \n\n*I keep thinking about how after each retreat, I'd come back with these beautiful insights written in my journal, but within weeks I'm back to checking emails during dinner with the kids. It's like I have this spiritual highlight reel but I'm not actually living it.*\n\nSo you're saying I can set intentions to help me hold onto that spark, not just visit it on weekends?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I embody spiritual insights in daily life, not just collect them\n2. I carry my grandmother's divine spark into board meetings and emails\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one... about carrying my grandmother's divine spark into those board meetings. That one hits something deep. \n\n*I can almost hear her voice - she had this way of finding the sacred in everything, even washing dishes. Meanwhile I'm treating my spiritual life like another item to check off my list.*\n\nBut the language feels... I don't know, a bit lofty for me. \"Divine spark\" sounds beautiful but maybe not quite how I'd say it. Can we make it more grounded? Like \"I remember what matters when I'm making decisions\" or something that feels more... mine?",
  "system3": "How about: \"I remember what matters when I'm in those board meetings\"\n\nOr: \"I carry my grandmother's grounded presence into work decisions\"\n\nOr: \"I trust the knowing that visits me with my kids when I'm back in the boardroom\"\n\nWhich feels most like you?",
  "user3": "*I trust the knowing that visits me with my kids when I'm back in the boardroom*\n\nThat one. That's it. Because it's not about being perfect or spiritual or anything - it's just about remembering what I already know when I'm in that other world. \n\nSometimes when I'm pushing my daughter on the swings, I get this... clarity. Like I can see what's actually important versus what I've been told is important. But then I'm back in those meetings and it's like I forget I ever knew that.\n\nSo yeah. I want to trust that knowing, even when the spreadsheets are flying.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I trust the knowing that visits me with my kids when I'm back in the boardroom\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user4": "The first one - *I embody spiritual insights in daily life* - that feels right, but maybe too... I don't know, self-helpy? Like I'm trying to sound enlightened or something.\n\nWhat if it's simpler? Like *I live what I learn* or *I don't just collect insights, I use them*? Something that acknowledges how I keep gathering these beautiful experiences but then I'm back to the same old patterns.\n\nBecause that's the thing - I have all these journals full of profound realizations, but I'm still checking my phone when my son is trying to show me his drawing. I want to actually *do* something different, not just understand it better.",
  "system5": "How about: \"I live what the medicine shows me\"\n\nOr: \"I use what I learn instead of just collecting insights\"\n\nWhich feels more like something you'd actually remember?",
  "user5": "*I use what I learn instead of just collecting insights*\n\nThat one. It's more... practical. Like I'm running a business, not just having experiences. Because that's what I keep doing - collecting these beautiful moments like souvenirs, but I'm not actually changing how I live.\n\nI can picture that on a sticky note on my monitor. Something to remind me that knowing isn't the same as doing.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I use what I learn instead of just collecting insights\n\nHow does the third one land - \"I show up fully present when my kids need me\"?",
  "user6": "It's close, but... *fully present* feels like I'm setting myself up to fail. Like, when am I ever fully present? I'm always half somewhere else.\n\nWhat if it's more honest? Like *I put my phone down when my kids talk to me* or *I look at them when they speak*? Something I can actually do, not just aspire to.\n\nBecause I keep promising myself I'll be more present, but then I'm physically there at the park and mentally drafting an email about some board drama. I want something concrete I can practice, not just another way to disappoint myself.",
  "system7": "How about: \"I look at my kids when they speak to me\"\n\nOr: \"I put my phone down when my kids want to show me something\"\n\nWhich feels like something you could actually practice?",
  "user7": "*I put my phone down when my kids want to show me something*\n\nThat one. Because it's specific, not vague. My daughter's always like \"Mom, look!\" and I'm like \"Uh-huh\" while scrolling through something that honestly isn't even important. \n\nI can do this. I can put the damn phone down when they want to show me their drawing or their rock collection or whatever tiny miracle they're excited about. It's not being perfect - it's just... noticing when they need me to actually see them.",
  "system8": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I use what I learn instead of just collecting insights\n2. I trust the knowing that visits me with my kids when I'm back in the boardroom  \n3. I put my phone down when my kids want to show me something\n\nPut them on your desk where you'll see them before work. \n\nThese are your compass, not perfection. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user8": "Thank you. I'll write them down and keep them where I can actually see them - maybe on my laptop where I can't miss them before those board meetings start.\n\nI... I don't know. This feels different than before. Like I'm not just collecting another set of intentions to forget about. These are things I can actually do, you know? Even when I'm tired or overwhelmed or just... being me.",
  "system9": "That's the point - they're things you can actually do. Even when you're tired, even when you're overwhelmed, even when you're just being you.\n\nTrust the process. The medicine works with what's real, not what's perfect.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user9": "Yeah. I guess I am. Thanks for helping me get there - to something that actually feels possible instead of just... aspirational.\n\nI'll see what happens when I'm back in that boardroom next week, trying to remember what matters when everyone's talking about quarterly projections and market share.",
  "system10": "You'll remember. These intentions live in your bones now, not just your head.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user10": "Okay. I will.",
  "system11": "Good.",
  "user11": "Yeah.",
  "system12": "You're set.",
  "user12": "I am. Thanks for walking through this with me.",
