  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... with what's happening at night. So here I am. I can't keep waking up like this\u2014can't keep having Amanda scared of me when I'm supposed to be protecting her.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up screaming at night\n2. Amanda feeling safe again \n3. Reclaim your role as protector instead of threat\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... that's about right. I hate that she looks at me like that\u2014like she doesn't know which version of me is gonna wake up. I need this to stop. Need to be the man she married, not... whatever this is.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make home safe for Amanda again\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I sleep peacefully through the night. That's the one. That's where it all starts\u2014if I can just... not wake up shouting, not wake up ready to fight something that isn't there. The rest of it... I don't know. Maybe that'll follow if I can just get some goddamn sleep.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep peacefully through the night\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "They land good. Real good. I need both of those\u2014need her to feel safe again, need to be the man she thought she was getting. Been pretending everything's fine for too long when it's not. She deserves better than this... better than me jumping at shadows.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make home safe for Amanda again\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Yeah... I'll keep 'em close. Been carrying my wallet for twenty years\u2014guess these can ride there too. Thanks for... for helping me get this straight. I just want to come back from Costa Rica and have her look at me the way she used to.",
  "system5": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what comes.\n\nSafe travels to Costa Rica.",
  "user5": "Appreciate it. Guess we'll see what happens when I get down there. Never thought I'd be doing something like this... but here we are. Just want to come back and be someone worth coming home to.",
  "system6": "That's the work. You're already doing it by showing up here.\n\nThe medicine will meet you where you are.",
  "user6": "I sure as hell hope so. 'Cause where I am ain't working anymore.",
  "system7": "That's exactly why it works.",
  "user7": "Then I guess I\u2019m ready as I\u2019ll ever be.",
  "system8": "That\u2019s all you need.",
  "user8": "Alright then. Let\u2019s get this done.",
  "system9": "Good. You're ready.",
  "user9": "Yeah... guess I am. Three weeks and I'm on that plane. Just gotta keep moving forward.",
  "system10": "Keep the intentions close. Keep moving. \n\nThe rest unfolds.",
  "user10": "I\u2019ll keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system11": "Perfect. \n\nWallet intentions travel with you. Trust what comes.",
  "user11": "Copy that.",
  "system12": "You're set.",
  "user12": "Copy. I\u2019ll see you on the other side.",
  "system13": "See you there.",
  "user13": "Roger that.",

  "user17": "...I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... well, with whatever's going on. So here I am. I can't keep going like this.",
  "system18": "You're here. That's enough.\n\nWhat's going on that brought you to this point?",
  "user18": "Amanda... she says I scare her sometimes. When I'm sleeping. I wake up shouting and she's just... looking at me like I'm a stranger. Been happening more lately. I told her it's just bad dreams, nothing to worry about, but...\n\nI can't lose her. I won't.",
  "system19": "You need Amanda to feel safe again. And you need to sleep without the terror.\n\nThree threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. Amanda feeling safe beside me again  \n3. Keep my family together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "I don't know how to say this stuff. \"Intentions\" sounds like... I don't know, like I'm making a Christmas list or something. \n\nBut yeah. I need to sleep. Real sleep, not whatever the hell this is where I'm back there every night. And I need Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm about to explode."
