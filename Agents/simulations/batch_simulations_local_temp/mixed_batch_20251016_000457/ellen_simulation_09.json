  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I guess I'm hoping it'll help me figure out what's next. I've built and sold companies, sat on boards, done all the things you're supposed to do. But I keep wondering if any of it actually matters. My grandmother used to say we all have a purpose bigger than ourselves, and I keep coming back to that. Maybe I'm searching for something I lost when I got so focused on achievement.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding purpose beyond achievement\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's wisdom about something bigger\n3. Discovering what actually matters after building what \"should\" matter\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three threads, that's it exactly. I keep circling around them but I haven't been able to land on what they actually mean for me. Like I'm standing at this crossroads where everything I've built feels hollow, but I don't know what would feel full instead. My grandmother would light candles every Friday and talk about repairing the world - *tikkun olam* - but I sold medical data software. It helped people, sure, but it wasn't... I don't know. Maybe I need to stop trying to solve this like a business problem and actually feel my way through it.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what feels full instead of hollow\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's *tikkun olam* in my own way\n3. I feel my way forward instead of solving my way through\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits me hardest - \"I discover what feels full instead of hollow.\" That hollow feeling, it's like this ache I can't quite name. The other two feel important but... I don't know. Maybe it's just that I need to start there, with figuring out what would actually fill me up. \n\nCan we make it more active though? Less like I'm waiting for something to happen to me and more like I'm actually doing the discovering?",
  "system3": "\"I actively discover what fills me instead of hollow\"\n\nHow's that?",
  "user3": "Yes. That's it. I want to carry that into the ceremony - actively discovering what fills me instead of hollow. It feels like permission to stop waiting for the answer to magically appear and actually participate in finding it.\n\nWhat's next?",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I actively discover what fills me instead of hollow\n\nHow do the other two land?\n\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's *tikkun olam* in my own way  \n3. I feel my way forward instead of solving my way through",
  "user4": "The second one... \"I reclaim my grandmother's tikkun olam in my own way\" - I want to say yes to that, but part of me feels like I'm appropriating something I don't fully understand. She had this deep faith, this connection to something ancient. I have quarterly board meetings and a meditation app I use sporadically. Maybe it's the word \"reclaim\" that feels off. Like I'm trying to take ownership of something sacred when really I just want to... honor it? Carry it forward without messing it up?\n\nAnd the third one - \"I feel my way forward instead of solving my way through\" - that one makes me nervous. I've solved my way through everything my whole life. It's literally what's made me successful. What if I feel my way somewhere terrible? What if I discover I don't actually want any of the things I've built?",
  "system5": "For the second one: \"I honor my grandmother's *tikkun olam* without corrupting it\"\n\nFor the third: \"I trust feeling forward even when it's terrifying\"\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user5": "The second one feels... right. Like I'm not trying to take something that isn't mine, just carry it gently. \"I honor my grandmother's tikkun olam without corrupting it\" - yeah. That's what I want. To not mess up whatever wisdom she had about making the world better.\n\nThe third one though... \"I trust feeling forward even when it's terrifying\" - I want to say yes, but that's a huge leap from where I am. Maybe \"I practice trusting feeling forward even when it scares me\"? Something that acknowledges this isn't going to be natural for me, but I'm willing to try?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I honor my grandmother's tikkun olam without corrupting it\n\n\"I practice trusting feeling forward even when it scares me\" - that works. You don't have to leap, just practice.\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n\n1. I actively discover what fills me instead of hollow\n2. I honor my grandmother's tikkun olam without corrupting it  \n3. I practice trusting feeling forward even when it scares me\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Thank you. These feel... I don't know, possible? Like they give me somewhere to start without trying to have it all figured out. I'll write them down - maybe keep them in my wallet next to that photo of the kids from Yosemite. Been carrying that for years.\n\nI actually feel... lighter? Which probably sounds ridiculous, but I thought I needed to have some big revelation figured out before the ceremony.",
  "system7": "Not ridiculous. Lighter is right - intentions point you toward what matters without demanding you carry the whole map.\n\nThe medicine works with what you've set. Trust these will take you where you need to go.",
  "user7": "I keep thinking about that first intention - actively discovering what fills me. It's weird to realize I've spent decades chasing things that were supposed to feel like success, and now I'm going into this ceremony asking to discover what would actually make me feel... not empty. Like I'm finally asking the right question, even if I don't know the answer yet.\n\nThank you for helping me get here.",
  "system8": "That's the right question - what actually fills you instead of what you're supposed to chase.\n\nThe intentions you set will serve you. Trust them.",
  "user8": "I do. I actually do trust them. And that's... new for me. Usually I'm second-guessing everything, trying to optimize or perfect or whatever. But these three intentions feel like they're mine in a way that's hard to explain. Like I didn't manufacture them - they were already there, waiting to be named.\n\nI'm going to go call my kids. Haven't talked to them since this morning, and I want to hear about their day without thinking about what emails I need to send tonight.",
  "system9": "Good instinct. Go be with them - fully present, no emails waiting in your head.\n\nThe intentions will be there when you need them.",
  "user9": "Yeah... yeah, they will. And maybe that's the point - they're not going anywhere. They'll be with me when I need them, not demanding my attention every second.\n\nThanks again. Really.",
  "system10": "Exactly. They're not going anywhere.\n\nYou're welcome.",
  "user10": "*logs off, feeling something settle in her chest that she's not sure she has words for yet*",
  "system11": "*the words will come when they're ready*",
  "user11": "*they always do, don't they? when I stop trying to force them*",
  "system12": "Always.",
  "user12": "*closes laptop, sits quietly for a moment before heading toward the sound of her children's laughter down the hall*",
  "system13": "*nods once, quiet acknowledgment of the moment*",
  "user13": "*pauses at their bedroom door, phone left behind on the kitchen counter*",
  "system14": "*good move*",
  "user14": "*feels the absence like a weight lifting, already lighter*",
  "system15": "*feels like breathing room, doesn't it?*",
  "user15": "*like remembering I still have lungs*",
  "system16": "Exactly.",
  "user16": "*stands there a little longer, letting the silence settle into bones that have been humming with static for months*",
  "system17": "*lets the quiet do its work*",
  "user17": "*finally walks in, sits on the edge of Leo\u2019s bed while he shows me some ridiculous Lego contraption, and for once I\u2019m not cataloguing tomorrow\u2019s board calls in my head\u2014just here, watching plastic bricks become a spaceship*",
  "system18": "That's the shift right there.",
  "user18": "*feels it crack open\u2014this tiny, ordinary moment soaking in like rain on concrete that\u2019s been baking too long*",
  "system19": "You've found the doorway.",
  "user19": "*doesn\u2019t want to name it yet, just cups the feeling gently, afraid it\u2019ll fly off if she looks too hard*"
