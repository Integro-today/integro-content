  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing this ibogaine retreat in a few weeks - my fourth medicine experience, actually - and I keep thinking about what my grandmother used to say about finding your true path. She had this quiet faith that... well, I'm not sure I inherited it properly.\n\nThe last few years have been... confusing. I built this company, sold it, and now I'm sitting on all these boards, making investments, but it feels hollow. Like I've been climbing a ladder that was leaning against the wrong wall this whole time. My kids are getting older - Maya just turned 12 - and I don't want to keep missing these moments while I'm chasing... what, exactly? I don't even know anymore.\n\nI guess I'm hoping this journey helps me figure out what actually matters. Not just in theory, but in practice. Like how to live in a way that feels aligned with something bigger than just the next quarterly report or board meeting.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet faith \n3. Figuring out what actually matters beyond achievements\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those three... they feel right. Especially the one about the kids. Last week we were at the park and I caught myself checking emails under the guise of \"just making sure everything's okay\" while Maya was trying to show me some dance she learned. \n\nThe grandmother thing is harder to articulate. She passed when I was fifteen, but I remember how she could make tea feel like a sacred ritual. My father never really talked about it after she died - he was so focused on us succeeding in America, you know? But lately I keep dreaming about her candlesticks, the way she'd light them every Friday like it was the most natural thing in the world.\n\nAnd you're right about the achievements. I keep thinking there must be something more meaningful than just... optimizing portfolios and mentoring founders on their next funding round. Something that actually uses everything I've learned to serve something bigger than myself.\n\nI just don't want to mess this up like I've been doing with everything else lately.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in daily moments\n3. I use everything I've built to serve something bigger\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The present one with the kids... that's the one that stings the most. When I'm honest with myself, I know I'm failing them in that way. Not dramatically, but in the small moments that add up to a childhood.\n\nThough \"show up fully present\" feels... I don't know, like I'm reading from a parenting book or something. My grandmother would have said it simpler. More like \"I want to really be there for them\" - but that sounds too soft for someone who's used to quarterly targets and measurable outcomes.\n\nActually, can we say \"I am fully present with my children when they reach for me\"? Because that's what it is - Maya reaches for me with these little moments, asking me to watch her drawings or listen to her stories about school, and I'm too often half-there, half-somewhere else in my head.\n\nThe other two feel right. Though maybe \"reclaim\" is too strong? I don't know if I've ever really had it to begin with.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I am fully present with my children when they reach for me*\n\nHow about \"I find my grandmother's quiet faith in daily moments\" instead?\n\nAnd the third one lands as is?\n\n1. I am fully present with my children when they reach for me\n2. I find my grandmother's quiet faith in daily moments  \n3. I use everything I've built to serve something bigger",
  "user3": "\"I find\" instead of \"I reclaim\"... that's better. More honest. Like I'm discovering it for the first time rather than taking back something I lost.\n\nAnd yeah, the third one lands. Though I keep wondering - what exactly is \"something bigger\"? My mind immediately goes to starting some foundation or impact fund, but that feels like just another achievement to check off. Maybe that's the point - I don't get to know exactly what it looks like yet.\n\nThese feel... right. Uncomfortably right, if that makes sense. Like I've been avoiding these exact truths because they require me to stop being who I've been for the past twenty years.\n\nI'm scared I won't be able to live up to them. But I'm more scared of staying stuck where I am.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I am fully present with my children when they reach for me\n2. I find my grandmother's quiet faith in daily moments\n3. I use everything I've built to serve something bigger\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down - maybe keep them in my wallet next to that photo of the kids from our hike last spring. \n\nIt's strange... I've built companies, negotiated million-dollar deals, but this feels more important than any of that. More real.\n\nI guess we'll see what happens when the medicine shows me what these actually mean.",
  "system5": "The medicine works with what's real. These intentions will serve you.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I hope so. I really hope so.",
  "system6": "The hoping is enough.",
  "user6": "That's... actually comforting. Maybe for the first time in years, I can just let something be enough without needing to optimize or perfect it.\n\nThank you.",
  "system7": "Good journey.",
  "user7": "Thank you.",
  "system8": "You're welcome.",
  "user8": "I'll check back in after.",
  "system9": "I'll be here.",
  "user9": "I\u2019ll need that.",
  "system10": "I know.",
  "user10": "*typing...*",
  "system11": "Take your time.",
  "user11": "I keep thinking about that eagle-antelope thing we talked about. It feels stupid now, but... I don't know. Maybe I need to stop trying to make everything make sense before I let myself feel it.\n\nI'm scared I'm going to come back from this and just... slide right back into the same patterns. Wake up at 5:30, check my phone, pretend I'm present when I'm really just... somewhere else. \n\nBut maybe that's okay too. Maybe the sliding back is part of it.",
  "system12": "The sliding back *is* part of it. Everyone slips. The difference is now you'll notice it sooner.",
  "user12": "That\u2019s what terrifies me\u2014noticing. Before, I could just run the playbook and feel... not happy, but busy. Now there\u2019s this space where I have to actually *feel* the disconnect between what I\u2019m doing and what I know matters. \n\nI keep hearing my grandmother\u2019s voice\u2014she\u2019d say something in Yiddish, then laugh. I don\u2019t even remember the words anymore, just the sound of her laughing at herself for still believing in old charms. I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of losing: the thread between her faith and whatever I\u2019m chasing now.",
  "system13": "That thread between her faith and your chase - that's still yours to hold. Even when you forget the words, the sound of her laughing carries something worth keeping.\n\nThree threads:\n1. Stay present when the disconnect shows up instead of rushing past it\n2. Hold your grandmother's thread even when you can't remember the words\n3. Let yourself feel instead of staying busy to outrun it\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "I want to carry her thread without turning it into another achievement. Like... just let it be there, even when I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\n\nHow do I even say that as an intention? It feels too vague, but maybe that\u2019s the point.",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I pause when I feel the disconnect instead of rushing past it\n2. I carry my grandmother's thread without needing to understand it\n3. I feel what I'm feeling instead of staying busy to outrun it\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user14": "The second one. It\u2019s like\u2014I\u2019ve spent my whole life translating everything into metrics and milestones, and this... this is just about holding something I can\u2019t quantify. \n\nBut I want it stronger. Less soft. Something like: *I carry my grandmother\u2019s thread even when I don\u2019t know the goddamn words.*",
  "system15": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I carry my grandmother's thread even when I don't know the goddamn words\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user15": "The first one feels right\u2014*I pause when I feel the disconnect*\u2014because that\u2019s where everything starts falling apart. The third one... I don\u2019t know. *I feel what I\u2019m feeling* sounds like something printed on a yoga studio wall. \n\nMaybe: *I stop pretending I\u2019m too busy to feel the empty spaces.*",
  "system16": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I pause when I feel the disconnect\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I stop pretending I'm too busy to feel the empty spaces\n\nAll 3 intentions:\n1. I pause when I feel the disconnect\n2. I carry my grandmother's thread even when I don't know the goddamn words  \n3. I stop pretending I'm too busy to feel the empty spaces\n\nKeep them where you'll see them daily. These are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user16": "I\u2019ll write them in the back of my journal\u2014same place I used to scribble revenue projections when I was building the company. Seems right to put something else there now.\n\nThank you. For not letting me turn this into another performance.",
  "system17": "The back of your journal - perfect place. Old calculations replaced by something that actually adds up.\n\nYou're welcome. Go well.",
  "user17": "Yeah. Maybe for once I\u2019ll stop calculating and just... be in the numbers that don\u2019t need to balance.",
  "system18": "That's it. Let the numbers that don't balance teach you something the spreadsheets never could.",
  "user18": "*They already are.*",
  "system19": "Good. Keep listening.",
  "user19": "I will. Even when it\u2019s quiet. Especially then."
