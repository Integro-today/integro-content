  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... well, with everything, I guess. Here I am. Can't keep going like this, waking up every night like I'm back there.\n\nLook, I don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff. But Amanda... she's had enough of my crap. Says she can't keep watching me disappear into whatever this is. So I'm here.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without waking up back there\n2. Stop disappearing from Amanda\n3. Find another way to live with whatever this is\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I guess that about sums it up. Don't know how you got all that from me just saying I wake up at night, but... yeah.\n\nSleep without the dreams. Stop scaring Amanda when I do wake up shouting. And figure out how to... I don't know. Live with whatever's broken without feeling like I'm broken. If that's even possible.\n\nHow do we turn that into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I live whole despite what happened\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "Number two hits hardest. \"Create safety for Amanda and myself.\" That gets right to it. She's told me she doesn't feel safe anymore when I wake up screaming, when I get that look. Hate seeing her flinch.\n\nThe other two... I don't know. \"Sleep peacefully\" sounds like something from a damn mattress commercial. And \"live whole despite what happened\" - I mean, what does that even mean? Too soft.\n\nWhat would you change them to?",
  "system3": "How about:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without terror\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I reclaim my life from what happened\n\nBetter?",
  "user3": "Yeah. That's... yeah. Number two stays exactly like that - \"I create safety for Amanda and myself.\" That's it. That's what I need to do.\n\nNumber one works. \"I sleep through the night without terror.\" Not peaceful - just no terror. That's real.\n\nNumber three... \"I reclaim my life from what happened.\" That's strong. That's not weak language. That's something I can get behind.\n\nSo those are the three then?",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without terror\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself  \n3. I reclaim my life from what happened\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you helping me get this straight. Three weeks and we'll see if this plant stuff actually does anything.",
  "system5": "Solid plan. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them close keeps you pointed toward what matters.\n\nThree weeks. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Trust what comes. We'll see about that.\n\nThanks again.",
  "system6": "You're welcome. See you on the other side.",

Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user13": "Look, Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep better. That's it. My wife Amanda... she's worried about me. Says I wake up shouting sometimes. I don't remember much, but I guess it's getting worse.\n\nI don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff, but I trust the guys who went through it. They wouldn't steer me wrong.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda feeling safe again\n3. Trusting the process enough to try\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "Yeah... that about sums it up. I hate that she has to sleep in the guest room some nights. Hate that my kids hear me.\n\nBut I don't need all that fancy language. Just... I want to sleep. I want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm about to break. And I want to stop feeling like I need to punch something every time I close my eyes.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me again\n3. I release the fight when I close my eyes\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user15": "The second one. Amanda feeling safe... that's everything. If I lose her, I lose everything I built when I came back home.\n\nBut \"feels safe beside me again\"? That's too soft. Makes me sound dangerous or something. I protected people my whole life - first in uniform, now with insurance. I just... I don't want her to have to sleep with one eye open anymore.",
  "system16": "I protect Amanda's peace at night like I protected everything else.",
  "user16": "Yeah. That's better. That's what I do - I protect what's mine. Always have.\n\nThough I'm not sure how some plant's gonna help me do what I couldn't figure out on my own for fifteen years. But if the guys say it works...",

  "user17": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for... well, for helping me find the words. I just want to be the man my kids think I am when they look at me.",
  "system18": "The words matter less than showing up. Your kids already see who you are - now you just need to believe it enough to rest.\n\nTrust the process. Trust yourself.",
  "user18": "I hear you. Just... hard to trust something I can't control, you know? Whole life has been about staying sharp, staying ready. Can't do that if I'm sleeping like a baby.\n\nBut maybe... maybe it's time to try something different.",
  "system19": "Different doesn't mean weak. Means you get to choose what you're fighting for now.",
  "user19": "Choose what I'm fighting for... yeah. That's... that's good. I like that.\n\nBeen fighting ghosts that ain't even there anymore. Maybe it's time to fight for the people who are still here."
