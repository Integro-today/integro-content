  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond next month for ibogaine. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me pieces of what I'm searching for, but the glow always fades. I keep coming back to my grandmother's faith\u2014she had this quiet certainty about something bigger, and I wonder if I've abandoned something important chasing achievements that don't seem to matter anymore.\n\nI don't need another business win. I need to know I'm living in a way that actually leaves the world better, not just my bank account fuller.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond achievements\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet certainty \n3. Living in a way that leaves the world better\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those threads feel right. I guess I'm just... tired of the performance. I've checked every box, built the company, made the money, but when I wake up at 5:30 and sit in my meditation corner that I barely use, I feel like I'm still playing a role. Even in my spiritual seeking, I keep wondering if I'm just collecting experiences like I collected business milestones.\n\nMy grandmother\u2014Bubbe\u2014she used to sing these old songs while cooking, and I'd roll my eyes as a kid. But she had something I'm desperate for. Not religion exactly, but... rootedness? She knew who she was regardless of what anyone thought. I want that certainty, but I'm terrified that underneath all my achievements, there's just... nothing.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live with Bubbe's rooted certainty, not performance\n2. I discover who I am beyond achievements \n3. I embody spiritual truth instead of collecting experiences\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one\u2014\"I live with Bubbe's rooted certainty, not performance\"\u2014that hits something. But I need it stronger. Less... soft. \n\nWhat about: \"I reclaim Bubbe's unshakeable knowing and burn the damn script I've been reading from.\" \n\nThe second one feels too vague. It's not just about discovering who I am\u2014it's about building something real from that place. Something that matters beyond quarterly returns and board meetings.\n\nMaybe: \"I build my next chapter from soul truth, not ego metrics.\"\n\nThe third one... I want to say I understand the difference between embodying and collecting, but honestly? I'm still the little girl at the piano recital waiting for applause. I don't know how to stop performing long enough to feel what's real.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I reclaim Bubbe's unshakeable knowing and burn the damn script I've been reading from\n\nHow about intention 2: I build my next chapter from soul truth, not ego metrics\n\nAnd for intention 3: I feel what's real instead of performing for approval\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "The first two feel solid\u2014like I could tattoo them on my wrist and actually live by them. But the third one... something's off. Maybe it's too abstract? \"Feel what's real\" sounds like something from a yoga class brochure.\n\nI need something that captures the terror of sitting in my kitchen at 3am when I can't fake it anymore. When I'm too exhausted to perform and have to face whatever's actually there.\n\nWhat about: \"I stay present when the performance breaks down, even when what's underneath terrifies me.\"\n\nOr maybe: \"I let my family see me unraveled, not just the version that powers through everything.\"\n\nGod, just saying that makes my chest tight. My kids\u2014Sarah and Marcus\u2014they deserve more than the CEO version of their mom.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I let my family see me unraveled, not just the version that powers through everything\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I reclaim Bubbe's unshakeable knowing and burn the damn script I've been reading from\n2. I build my next chapter from soul truth, not ego metrics  \n3. I let my family see me unraveled, not just the version that powers through everything\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll keep them close\u2014maybe in that meditation corner I keep avoiding. These intentions... they feel like they could actually guide me somewhere real this time, not just another impressive destination.\n\nI need to tell my husband David about these before I go. He's been watching me chase spiritual experiences like I used to chase funding rounds, and I think he's worried I'm just collecting another kind of trophy. But this feels different. These intentions\u2014they're about burning down the trophy case, not adding to it.\n\nI guess we'll see what ibogaine does with them.",
  "system5": "The medicine works with authentic. These intentions will serve you, even if you forget them during the journey.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I hope so. I've gotten pretty good at forgetting the important stuff and remembering the noise. But maybe this time... maybe this time I can actually let the medicine do its work instead of trying to manage the experience like it's a board meeting.\n\nThank you for helping me get clear on this. Really clear.",
  "system6": "That's the work - showing up real instead of managing the outcome. You're ready.",
  "user6": "I feel that. Different than before\u2014like I'm walking in with nothing to prove for once. Just... walking in.",
  "system7": "That's when the medicine can actually reach you. Walk in empty-handed.",
  "user7": "Walking in empty-handed. God, that might be the hardest thing I've ever done.",
  "system8": "Harder than building your company from nothing? You know how to start from zero. This is just a different kind of starting over.",
  "user8": "Different kind of zero. With the company, I had my brain, my network, my ability to outwork everyone. This... this is stripping all that away and seeing what's left when I can't hustle my way through. \n\nBut you're right. I know how to build from nothing. Just never occurred to me that \"nothing\" might be the actual starting point, not something to avoid.",
  "system9": "Exactly. The hustle got you here. Now you get to find out what stays standing when that falls away.\n\nYou're walking in with the right kind of nothing.",
  "user9": "This nothing feels... terrifying and right. Like maybe it's been waiting for me to finally stop long enough to notice it was there all along.",
  "system10": "That's the one. The nothing that was always underneath everything you built.",
  "user10": "Yeah. And maybe that's what I've been running from all these years.",
  "system11": "Probably. But you stopped running.",
  "user11": "I did. Took me forty-something years, but... here I am.",
  "system12": "Forty-something years to get to this doorway. That's not late. That's exactly on time.",
  "user12": "Exactly on time. I like that. My grandmother used to say the soul keeps its own schedule.",
  "system13": "Your grandmother knew what she was talking about.",
  "user13": "She really did. I keep thinking about her faith\u2014how she carried it like this quiet compass, never needing to prove anything to anyone. I think that's what I'm trying to get back to. Not the religion necessarily, but that unshakable knowing underneath everything.",
  "system14": "That's your thread right there - that steady knowing underneath everything you've built and lost.",
  "user14": "That's it exactly. Like there's this current running beneath all the achievements and exits and board meetings... and sometimes I can feel it when I'm hiking with the kids or when everything gets quiet at 5:30 in the morning. But then I lose it again.",
  "system15": "You feel it in those real moments - kids, quiet morning hours - then the noise of everything you built takes over again.",
  "user15": "Yeah. It's like... I know how to build companies, scale teams, close deals. But I don't know how to hold onto that feeling when the emails start piling up and someone's texting about a board meeting and the kids need homework help. It just... slips away.",
  "system16": "You know how to build everything except how to stay connected to what matters when life gets loud.",
  "user16": "That's... yeah. That's exactly it. I can architect a business model but I can't seem to architect a life where that connection doesn't get drowned out by the noise I created.",
  "system17": "Three threads:\n\n1. That steady knowing underneath everything - your grandmother's quiet compass\n2. Being present in real moments instead of mentally building your next thing\n3. Holding onto that feeling when life gets loud\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user17": "Okay... so like, \"I want to remember that steady knowing even when I'm in the middle of chaos\"? I don't know. That feels too vague. Maybe \"I intend to pause and feel my feet on the ground before every board meeting\"? That's more specific but... I don't know if I'm missing something bigger here.",
  "system18": "You're reaching for the right balance - specific enough to anchor you, but not so narrow it disappears when life shifts.",
  "user18": "Exactly. I keep trying to make it into another achievement project - like if I just find the perfect intention, I'll finally get it right. But that's the same trap, isn't it? Trying to optimize my way to connection.",
  "system19": "You're trying to achieve your way out of the achievement trap - same pattern, different packaging.",
  "user19": "God, that's so true. I'm literally trying to win at not being so achievement-focused. It's like... I don't know how to want something without immediately turning it into a goal with metrics and outcomes."
