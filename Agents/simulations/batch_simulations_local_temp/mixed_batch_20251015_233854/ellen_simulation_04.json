  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I have an ibogaine retreat coming up in Cancun this winter. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... but this feels different. More serious, maybe. \n\nI've been searching for something deeper since I sold my company five years ago. Thought I'd feel fulfilled when I \"made it\" - built something impressive, had financial freedom. But that hollow feeling never went away. I've had beautiful glimpses during these medicines... connection, purpose, this sense that there's something bigger. Then I come home and it's like the old patterns swallow me whole again.\n\nI can't keep living this fragmented life - successful on paper but spiritually rudderless. My kids deserve more than a distracted mother who's physically there but mentally somewhere else. And I... I deserve to feel whole.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n2. Reconnecting with the purpose you glimpse in ceremonies\n3. Living wholeness instead of just understanding it conceptually\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are exactly right. It's like... I know what I need to do, I just can't seem to hold onto it. In ceremony, everything feels clear and connected. Then I'm back to checking emails during dinner.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n2. I reclaim the purpose and connection I find in ceremony\n3. I live wholeness instead of just understanding it\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - being present for my kids. That's the one that cuts deepest when I fail at it. Yesterday my daughter was telling me about her science project and I was nodding while mentally drafting an email to investors. I saw her face fall when she realized I wasn't really there.\n\nBut \"show up fully present\" feels... I don't know. Too soft? I've built my whole life on measurable outcomes, and \"being present\" feels like one of those things you can't track or prove. Maybe that's exactly why I need it.",
  "system3": "Your daughter's face tells you everything you need to know about whether you're tracking it.\n\nKeep intention 1 as is - it's working exactly because it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "You're right about the discomfort. That probably means I'm on to something real.\n\nThe second one... \"reclaim the purpose and connection I find in ceremony.\" I want to say yes to that, but part of me is skeptical. Like, what if there isn't actually a purpose? What if I'm just another privileged woman chasing spiritual experiences because I'm bored? My grandmother would roll her eyes - she had real faith, real community. I have... retreats and a meditation app I don't use consistently.\n\nThe third one about wholeness... that one feels true. I know what it feels like to be whole - I've touched it out there on hiking trails with my kids, in those perfect moments before my phone buzzes. I just don't know how to stay there.",
  "system4": "Intention 2: *I trust what the medicine shows me about purpose, even when doubt creeps in*\n\nIntention 3 stays: *I live wholeness instead of just understanding it*\n\nAll 3 locked in:\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n2. I trust what the medicine shows me about purpose, even when doubt creeps in  \n3. I live wholeness instead of just understanding it\n\nKeep them in your wallet. Read them each morning.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll... I'll keep them close. Maybe write them on something more permanent than my phone - phones die, notifications drown things out.\n\nI keep thinking about what you said about my daughter's face. She's been trying to tell me something about her art class for weeks, and I keep half-listening. Maybe tomorrow morning when they come stumbling into our room like they always do, I'll actually see them instead of planning my day.\n\nI don't know if ibogaine will give me what I'm looking for. But these three things... they feel like they point toward the person I keep glimpsing in those medicine spaces. The one who knows how to just be.",
  "system5": "That morning moment - when they come stumbling in - that's where intention meets life. Start there.\n\nThe medicine will meet you where these three points aim you. Trust that.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Tomorrow morning then. No phone, no planning the day while they're talking. Just... be there when they need me. That's where it all starts, doesn't it? Not in some fancy retreat center, but in those messy, beautiful moments that happen every day if I'm actually awake for them.\n\nI think I'm ready.",
  "system6": "Exactly. Those messy morning moments are the real ceremony.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "I am.",
  "system7": "Solid compass.",
  "user7": "Thank you\u2014for seeing through all my noise and helping me find something true to hold onto.",
  "system8": "You brought the truth. I just helped you name it.",
  "user8": "Maybe that's all any of us need\u2014someone to help us name what we already know deep down.",
  "system9": "That's the work.",
  "user9": "Yeah. It is.",
  "system10": "Go be with your people.",
