  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an Ibogaine retreat at Beond in a few weeks, and honestly, I feel like I'm at this crossroads. I've built this incredible company and sold it, I've got this beautiful family... but I wake up at 5:30 every morning and I'm just... restless. Like I've been climbing this ladder my whole life, and now that I'm at the top, I realize it's leaning against the wrong wall. I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this deep knowing about what matters, and I feel like I've lost touch with that.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond the climb\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet faith\n3. Making peace with the restlessness\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three threads feel right. They keep showing up in different ways. Like when I'm at the park with my kids watching them chase each other around - there's this moment where everything feels simple and true. And then my phone buzzes and it's back to the noise.\n\nMy grandmother used to say something in Yiddish about how we can't find what we're not willing to lose. I never really understood what she meant until recently. Maybe I need to let go of being the achiever to find out who I actually am underneath all that.\n\nI want to be present for my family too. My kids are nine and twelve - they're growing so fast and I'm always half somewhere else, thinking about some board meeting or investment. My husband... he's patient but I know he doesn't get this spiritual pull I have. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in two completely different worlds.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover who I am beyond the achiever\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in daily moments\n3. I show up fully present when my kids and husband need me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about my grandmother's faith - that hits something deep. Not just the words, but... I want to feel what she had. That certainty that there's something bigger, something that holds us even when we can't see it.\n\nBut \"discover who I am beyond the achiever\" - that feels a little... I don't know, too therapy-speak? Maybe something more like \"I see who I am when I'm not proving anything to anyone.\" Because that's what it feels like - this constant need to prove, to achieve, to show I'm valuable. When does it stop?\n\nAnd the third one... I want to be there for them, but I also want to feel connected to them. Not just physically present but emotionally there. Like really seeing them, you know? Sometimes I watch them and it's like I'm looking through fog.\n\nWhat about: \"I find my grandmother's faith in the quiet moments\" and \"I see my family with clear eyes and open heart\"?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I find my grandmother's faith in the quiet moments\n\nHow do the other two feel now?\n\n1. I see who I am when I'm not proving anything to anyone\n3. I see my family with clear eyes and open heart",
  "user3": "Those both feel... closer. More honest. \n\nBut I keep thinking about how my grandmother never had to prove anything to anyone - she just *was*. She baked bread on Fridays, she lit candles, she hummed while she cooked. She wasn't trying to be anything special, she was just present in her life. That's what I want to find again.\n\nAnd with my family - yeah, clear eyes and open heart feels right. Not being half somewhere else, not thinking about the next thing, just... being there with them. Really there.\n\nI think these work. I think... I think I'm ready to carry these with me.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I see who I am when I'm not proving anything to anyone\n2. I find my grandmother's faith in the quiet moments  \n3. I see my family with clear eyes and open heart\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll keep them close - maybe write them in the journal I keep meaning to use more regularly. Or even just... in my phone notes, since that's probably where I look most anyway.\n\nIt feels good to have something to hold onto. Something that isn't about achievement or success, but about... just being human, I guess. Being real.\n\nI appreciate you helping me find the words for what I've been feeling.",
  "system5": "Good. The journal or phone - whatever you'll actually use.\n\nThe medicine works with what's real. These intentions will serve you.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I will. \n\nThere's something about having these three intentions that feels... grounding. Like I'm not just going into this experience hoping for some vague breakthrough, but actually carrying something specific to work with. My grandmother would probably say that's the difference between wandering and walking with purpose.\n\nI'll trust the process. Whatever comes up, comes up.",
  "system6": "Exactly. Between wandering and walking with purpose - your grandmother knew.\n\nThe iboga will show you what you need. These just point you toward what matters.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user6": "She always said the right things, even when I didn't understand them. Maybe that's what I'm really looking for - to understand what she knew all along.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way to this.",
  "system7": "You're welcome. \n\nShe's still with you in this - in the quiet moments, in the faith you're carrying forward.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "I feel that. Not in some mystical way, but... yeah, she's here. In how I want to be present for my kids, in how I'm trying to stop proving myself to everyone. All of it.\n\nThank you for walking through this with me. Really.",
  "system8": "I hear you. That's real - not mystical, just true.\n\nYou're walking your own path now, with her lessons in your pocket.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user8": "I am. And I think... I think that's enough.",
  "system9": "It is.",
  "user9": "Good. \n\nI'll carry these forward - the intentions, her memory, all of it. Whatever happens in Cancun, I know I'm not just chasing another achievement. I'm finally walking toward something real.\n\nThank you for helping me see that.",
  "system10": "You see it now. That's what matters.\n\nWalk well.",
  "user10": "I will. With her in my heart and these intentions in my pocket\u2014I'm walking toward something real this time.\n\nThank you for everything.",
  "system11": "You're welcome. \n\nWalk steady.",
  "user11": "I will. With steady steps and an open heart.",
  "system12": "*quiet nod*\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user12": "I am. Let\u2019s do this.",
  "system13": "*another nod*\n\nGo.",
  "user13": "*quiet breath*\n\nI'm going.",
  "system14": "Good.",
  "user14": "*deep breath*\n\nThank you\u2014for seeing through all my noise, for helping me find the thread. I'll carry this forward, even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.\n\nGoodbye.",
  "system15": "Go well.",
  "user15": "I will. With everything you've helped me see\u2014I'm walking forward now.",
  "system16": "Walk on.",
  "user16": "Walking. Heart steady, eyes open. The path is there now.",
  "system17": "It always was.",
  "user17": "Then let me keep walking it\u2014no more circling back.",
  "system18": "Keep walking.",
  "user18": "I am. One foot, then the other\u2014no looking back.",
  "system19": "Good.",
  "user19": "Good."
