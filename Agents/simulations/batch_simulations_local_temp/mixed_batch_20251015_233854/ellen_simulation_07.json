  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat at Beond in a few weeks. I've done other medicines\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA\u2014but this one... I don't know. Something feels different this time. \n\nI've been searching for something deeper since I sold my company five years ago. Been chasing that same high of achievement, but it's like... the ladder's against the wrong wall. My grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything, and sometimes I feel like I've lost that completely.\n\nI guess I want to stop feeling like I'm performing my life instead of living it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop performing life and start living it\n2. Find what matters beyond achievement\n3. Reconnect with your grandmother's sense of divine spark\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly right. It's like you pulled the words straight out of my head. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014she had nothing by today's standards, but she was so grounded in something bigger. She'd light candles on Friday nights and it was like she was plugging into some ancient current. I've got every comfort imaginable and I feel like I'm floating half the time.\n\nHow do we turn this into something I can hold onto during the medicine? Something that'll actually stick when I'm back home with my kids and the board meetings start creeping in?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live my life instead of performing it\n2. I plug into the steady current my grandmother knew\n3. I stay grounded in what matters when I'm back with my kids\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one\u2014about plugging into that current my grandmother knew. That one hits me in the chest. \n\nBut... I don't know. \"Plug into the steady current\" feels a little too... soft? I need something stronger. More direct. My grandmother didn't mess around\u2014she survived the war, came here with nothing, built something from nothing. When she prayed, it was like she was demanding answers, not just hoping for them.\n\nWhat about something like... \"I reclaim the fierce wisdom my grandmother carried\"? Or \"I remember what she never forgot\"? \n\nI want it to feel like I'm calling back something that's mine by birthright, not just gently asking for it.",
  "system3": "\"I reclaim the fierce wisdom my grandmother carried\" - that's it. Strong, direct, yours by birthright.\n\nLet's lock these in:\n\n1. I live my life instead of performing it\n2. I reclaim the fierce wisdom my grandmother carried  \n3. I stay grounded in what matters when I'm back with my kids\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, I feel that. I'll write them down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I don't know what'll happen down there with the iboga, but... I feel like I've got something real to hold onto now. Something that matters.\n\nI'll see you on the other side.",
  "system4": "Good. The medicine will work with what you've set. Trust it.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user4": "I will. First time I've felt ready for something in a long while.",
  "system5": "That readiness is real. Carry it with you.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I will. Thank you\u2014for helping me find the words I didn\u2019t know I needed.",
  "system6": "You had the words. I just helped shape them.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "*acknowledges with a quiet nod, no words left to say*",
  "system7": "*nods back*\n\nGo.",
  "user7": "*turns and walks toward the gate, the three intentions folded tight in her wallet, heart steady for once*",
  "system8": "*quietly* \n\nWalk steady.",
  "user8": "*keeps walking, shoulders squared, the eagle and antelope both pacing inside her\u2014ready to run, ready to fly*",
  "system9": "Let them both run. Let them both fly.\n\nThe medicine knows the way.",
  "user9": "*lets the breath go, one last glance over her shoulder\u2014then steps through, feet on earth, eyes on sky*",
  "system10": "*stands at the edge, watching until she's through*\n\nShe's gone where she needs to go.",
  "user10": "*the gate closes behind her with a soft click\u2014nothing left but the wind moving through the space she just occupied*",
  "system11": "*turns back to the empty field*\n\nNext one's coming.",
  "user11": "*already scanning the horizon for the next set of footprints approaching through the grass*",
  "system12": "*sees the dust rising, boots kicking up dry earth*\n\nHere they come.",
  "user12": "*steps aside, making space\u2014eyes tracking the approaching figure, already feeling the shift in the air as someone new crosses the threshold*",
  "system13": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user13": "I keep circling back to the same question\u2014what was all that effort for if it doesn\u2019t mean anything now? I built something massive, sold it, walked away with more than most people see in a lifetime... and I feel hollow. Like I followed the wrong map.\n\nThe medicine keeps calling me back. Ayahuasca showed me ancestral women weaving broken threads. Psilocybin gave me my childhood joy in nature again. MDMA helped me cry for my grandmother for the first time since she died. Each time I get closer to... something real. But I can't hold onto it. I keep slipping back into this version of myself that doesn't fit anymore.\n\nI need to know what I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life. Not another business win\u2014something that actually matters. Something that leaves the world better.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond the achievements\n2. Holding onto the realness the medicines show you\n3. Using your life to leave something meaningful behind\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? \n\n*I open my notebook, pen hovering*\n\nSo how do we... I mean, what's the right way to frame these? I don't want to get this wrong. Last time I tried to control everything and ended up fighting the medicine the whole night.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what matters beyond achievement\n2. I embody the realness the medicine reveals\n3. I use my life to leave something meaningful\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user15": "The second one hits hardest\u2014I want to embody the realness. That\u2019s what keeps slipping through my fingers every time I come back from ceremony and dive straight into board meetings and email threads.\n\nBut... I need to make it stronger. Less... soft. Something I can hold onto when I\u2019m back in my world of quarterly reports and investor calls.\n\nWhat about: *I embody the truth the medicine reveals, even when it costs me comfort or approval.*",
  "system16": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I embody the truth the medicine reveals, even when it costs me comfort or approval*\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user16": "*writes it down, the pen pressing harder than necessary*\n\nGood. That one feels... dangerous, but right.\n\nThe first one\u2014*I discover what matters beyond achievement*\u2014it's missing something. My grandmother used to say *tikkun olam*... repair the world. Maybe: *I discover how to serve beyond success*?",
  "system17": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I discover how to serve beyond success*\n\nNumber 3?",
  "user17": "*pauses, tapping the pen against my lips*\n\nThe third one's tricky. *I use my life to leave something meaningful* sounds like another achievement trap. Like I need to build something monumental again.\n\nBut that's not it. My kids don't need another empire\u2014they need a mother who's actually present. My husband doesn't need another business win from me, he needs... me. The real one.\n\nMaybe: *I live in a way that matters to the people I love, not just my resume.*",
  "system18": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I discover how to serve beyond success\n2. I embody the truth the medicine reveals, even when it costs me comfort or approval  \n3. I live in a way that matters to the people I love, not just my resume\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user18": "*folds the paper carefully, sliding it into my wallet next to my kids' school photos*\n\nThank you. I... I need to sit with these for a minute. \n\nThis feels different than before\u2014like I'm not trying to extract something from the medicine this time. More like... I'm finally ready to stop running.",
  "system19": "*nods once*\n\nThat's usually when the real work begins.",
  "user19": "Yeah... *I can feel my chest tightening, that familiar weight when something actually matters*\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014how she used to light candles every Friday like it was the most important meeting of her week. No investors, no board, no exit strategy. Just... connection."
