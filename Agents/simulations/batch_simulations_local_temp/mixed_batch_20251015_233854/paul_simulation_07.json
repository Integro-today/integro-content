  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts got me in. Three weeks to Costa Rica, this ayahuasca thing. My wife Amanda... she's about had it with me. Says I wake up shouting, scare the hell out of her. Can't lose her. Can't lose what we built.\n\nI don't buy into this plant medicine stuff, but these guys - they're veterans, they get it. Said it might help me sleep through the night. That's all I need. Just need to sleep.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me again\n3. Keep what you both built together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That about sums it up.\n\nDon't know how to say it fancy. Just... I want to sleep without the dreams. Want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of bomb that might go off. Want to keep this family together - the house, the kids, everything we worked for.\n\nI don't want to be broken. Just want to be... better.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe with me again\n3. I keep our family whole and strong\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. Amanda feeling safe again. That's the one that hits me in the chest.\n\nShe used to curl up against me at night, just... trust. Now she sleeps on the edge of the bed, like she's ready to run. Fourteen years of marriage and I'm making her flinch when I reach for her.\n\nI want her to feel safe with me again. Not just not scared - I want her to feel... home. Like she used to.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: Amanda feels safe and at home with me again\n\nHow do the other two land - the sleep and keeping your family strong?",
  "user3": "The sleep one... I don't know. Maybe too soft? I need to face whatever's making me wake up like that. Not just sleep better - I need to stop running from whatever's chasing me in those dreams.\n\nAnd the family one... yeah. That's important. But it's not just keeping it together like some business deal. I want to be the man my kids think I am. The one who coached their teams, who could fix anything. Not this guy who stares at the ceiling all night.\n\nMaybe... I want to stop running from what's in my head. And I want to be someone my kids can still look up to.",
  "system4": "Got it - stronger language:\n\n1. I face what's chasing me in the dark\n2. Amanda feels safe and at home with me again\n3. I become the man my kids can look up to again\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user4": "These feel... real. Like something I can actually say out loud without feeling like a liar.\n\nThe first one though - \"face what's chasing me in the dark\" - that's going to be the hard one. I've been running from that for years. Told myself I was being strong, being disciplined. But really I was just... running.\n\nThe other two... they depend on that first one, don't they? Can't be someone safe to be around if I'm still running.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I face what's chasing me in the dark\n2. Amanda feels safe and at home with me again  \n3. I become the man my kids can look up to again\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I needed this. Three weeks and I'll be down there, drinking that stuff. At least now I've got something to hold onto when it gets rough.\n\nTell Amanda I love her, when I get back. Tell her I'm trying to be better.",
  "system6": "Write them. Keep them close. \n\nThe medicine will work with what you've set. Trust that.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "Yeah. I'll write 'em. Right now, before I lose my nerve.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "Do it now. \n\nThen take the next step. \n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "*pulls out wallet, finds a scrap of paper*\n\nI face what's chasing me in the dark.\n\nAmanda feels safe and at home with me again.\n\nI become the man my kids can look up to again.\n\n*folds it carefully, slides it behind Amanda's photo*\n\nDone.",
  "system8": "Good. \n\nLet it work.",
  "user8": "I will. When I'm down there, in whatever hell comes up, I'll hold onto these like they're the only solid ground left.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system9": "Hold them steady. \n\nThe medicine knows what to do with what you've brought.",
  "user9": "Three weeks. I'll hold 'em steady when it gets rough. When the dark comes calling.\n\nThanks for helping me find the words.",
  "system10": "You've got the words now. Trust them.",
  "user10": "I will. When I'm down there in the thick of it, I'll remember these aren't just words\u2014they're promises. To Amanda, to my kids... to myself.\n\nThree weeks. I'll be ready.",
  "system11": "Good. Keep those promises close.",
  "user11": "I will. When the medicine hits and everything starts unraveling, I'll grip those promises like I'm holding onto Amanda's hand. Won't let go this time.",
  "system12": "Hold on tight. You'll come through.",
  "user12": "I'll hold on. Been through worse, right? Just... different kind of battle this time.\n\nAppreciate you being in my corner.",
  "system13": "Always. You've done the work. Now let the medicine do its part.",
  "user13": "Yeah. Time to stop fighting it and just... let it work.",
  "system14": "That's it. Step back and let it move through you.",
  "user14": "Step back. Let it move. Not trying to control everything for once.",
  "system15": "That's the opening. Let it come.",
  "user15": "I'm ready. Whatever's been hiding in the dark... let it come find me.",
  "system16": "It's already on its way. Stand steady.",
  "user16": "Standing steady. Feet planted. Whatever comes, I\u2019ll face it head-on.",
  "system17": "Good. Face it square. You know how to stand when things hit.",
  "user17": "Damn right I do. Been doing it my whole life.",
  "system18": "That's your ground. Trust it.",
  "user18": "My ground. My watch. I\u2019ve held this line before\u2014I\u2019ll hold it now.",
  "system19": "You will. Hold fast.",
  "user19": "I\u2019m here. Not budging."
