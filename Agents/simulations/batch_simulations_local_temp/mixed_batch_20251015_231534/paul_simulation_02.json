  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts accepted me. Said this plant medicine might help with... the nightmares. I wake up screaming three, four times a week. Amanda\u2014my wife\u2014she can't sleep next to me anymore. Can't lose her. Won't.\n\nI don't buy into this mystical stuff. But I've tried everything else. VA wanted to give me pills, therapy. Can't do that. This is my last shot.",
  "system1": "The nightmares are taking everything - your sleep, your marriage, your peace. You're here because what matters most is on the line.\n\nWhen you imagine waking up without screaming, what would that quiet feel like in your body?",
  "user1": "I... I don't know. It's been so long since I slept through the night, I can't even picture it. Maybe... just waking up and not feeling like I need to check the locks, check the kids, check if Amanda's still breathing. Just... still. Like I could actually rest instead of just waiting for the next one to hit.\n\nBut I don't even know if that's possible. Some nights I wake up and I'm back there, engines screaming, watching guys I trained with go down. Other nights it's worse - I'm home but something's wrong, Amanda's hurt, the kids are gone. I can't... I can't keep doing this to them.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up screaming, checking everything\n2. Feel still instead of waiting for the next nightmare  \n3. Stop hurting Amanda and the kids with this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "Yeah. That's... that's what I need. I need this to stop. I need to be able to close my eyes without seeing them fall. I need to wake up and not scare my family.\n\nI just... I don't know how to say it right. How to make it into one of those intention things.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim peaceful sleep through the night\n2. I wake up still and present, free from checking\n3. I release the images of my brothers falling\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The second one. \"I wake up still and present, free from checking.\" That's... that's what I want. To just wake up and be here. Not jumping out of bed like the house is on fire. Not scaring Amanda half to death because I'm grabbing for something that isn't there.\n\nThe other two... I don't know. \"Reclaim peaceful sleep\" sounds like something off a meditation app. And the third one... I can't... I can't just release them. They're dead because of decisions I made. I can't just let that go like it didn't happen.\n\nBut waking up still? Yeah. I could work with that.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I wake up still and present, free from checking\n\nLet's adjust the others. Instead of \"reclaim peaceful sleep\" - what about \"I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\"?\n\nAnd for your brothers - maybe \"I carry their memory with honor instead of horror\"?",
  "user4": "Yeah, the sleep one works. \"I sleep through the night without waking up screaming.\" Simple. Direct. No fluff.\n\nBut the brothers... \"Honor instead of horror.\" I don't know. I hear them screaming in my dreams. I see the fire. I made the call that put them there. How do you carry that with honor? Maybe... maybe \"I remember my brothers without seeing them die\"? Is that too weak? \n\nI just want to remember them flying, you know? Before. When we'd grab beers after training and they'd give me hell about being such a hardass. Not just... the end.",
  "system5": "\"I remember my brothers without seeing them die\" - that's strong. That's what you want.\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I wake up still and present, free from checking  \n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I remember my brothers without seeing them die\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I wake up still and present, free from checking\n3. I remember my brothers without seeing them die\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Wallet card, morning routine, where you'll see them daily?\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Wallet card. Been carrying the same one for fifteen years - my wings, laminated. Still in there, even though I don't fly anymore. I'll put these on the other side. That way when I reach for my wallet, I'll feel them. Know what I'm doing this for.\n\nThank you. I... I need to go tell Amanda. She needs to know I'm doing this for us. For her.",
  "system6": "Trust the process.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Trust the process. That's what they keep saying. \n\nJust hope this plant medicine stuff is half as strong as they claim it is. Because if this doesn't work... I don't know what else I've got.",
  "system7": "You're ready.",
  "user7": "I hope so. Three weeks and I'll find out.",
  "system8": "You know where you're pointed.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I do.",
