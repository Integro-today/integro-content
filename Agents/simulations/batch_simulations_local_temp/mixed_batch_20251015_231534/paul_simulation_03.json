  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with... well, with everything, I guess. Here I am. Can't keep going like this\u2014waking up at 3 AM with my heart pounding, Amanda pretending she's still asleep so I don't know she heard me shouting again. \n\nThree weeks and I'm on a plane to Costa Rica for something I don't even believe in. But if I don't do something, I'm gonna lose her.",
  "system1": "The nightmares are costing you more than sleep - they're threatening what matters most. Three weeks to try something different makes sense when everything else hasn't worked.\n\nWhat happens in those 3 AM moments? What are you seeing that has you shouting?",
  "user1": "Look, I don't\u2014it's not like I'm seeing anything specific. Just... loud noises, mostly. Sometimes it's like I'm back in the cockpit, but it's all jumbled up. Nothing makes sense. \n\n[pauses]\n\nIt's stupid. I'm not some broken war hero with PTSD. I just need to sleep better. That's all.",
  "system2": "Your body remembers what your mind won't name. Loud noises, cockpit fragments, jumbled time - that's how trauma stores itself.\n\nYou want better sleep, but you're fighting to keep Amanda close. What's underneath the \"just need to sleep better\" story?",
  "user2": "*exhales sharply*\n\nIt's... I hate this. I hate that she looks at me like I'm some ticking bomb. Like she has to walk on eggshells around her own husband. \n\nSometimes I wake up and she's not even in bed anymore. Found her sleeping on the couch last week. Said she didn't want to wake me, but I know why. She doesn't want to be there when I... when whatever's happening happens.\n\nI just want to be the man she married. Not whatever this is now.",
  "system3": "Three threads:\n\n1. Want to be the man Amanda married\n2. Stop being a ticking bomb she fears\n3. Sleep without the loud noises taking over\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user3": "I don't know about this intention stuff. Sounds like... I don't know, therapy talk or something. \n\nBut yeah. Those three things. That's what I want.",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n2. I release this bomb that keeps detonating\n3. I rest through the night without the cockpit calling me back\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "*shifts uncomfortably*\n\nThat second one... \"release this bomb.\" I don't like how that sounds. Makes me feel like I'm admitting I'm dangerous or something.\n\nWhat about \"I find steady ground when the noise starts\" or... I don't know. \"I stay present when the past gets loud.\"\n\nSomething like that.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I stay present when the past gets loud\"\n\nHow do intentions 1 and 3 land? Want to adjust those too?",
  "user5": "Yeah, let me see... \n\nThe first one\u2014I want to be that man again, but maybe... maybe it's more about remembering who that was. Not just reclaiming him like he's lost somewhere.\n\nAnd the third one... I don't want to just \"rest through the night.\" I want to sleep like a normal person. Wake up and not have to check if I woke Amanda up. Maybe... \"I sleep peaceful nights like I used to.\"\n\nI don't know. Does that work?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I remember who I was before\"\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I sleep peaceful nights like I used to\"\n\u2713 Intention 2 already locked: \"I stay present when the past gets loud\"\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I remember who I was before\n2. I stay present when the past gets loud  \n3. I sleep peaceful nights like I used to\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Wallet, morning routine, where you'll see them daily?\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Yeah, I'll keep them in my wallet. Been carrying that thing for twenty years\u2014might as well keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate this.",
  "system7": "Trust the process.",
  "user7": "*pauses*\n\nYeah. I'll try.",
  "system8": "That's enough for now.",
  "user8": "Alright. I'll head out then. Thanks again.",
  "system9": "Solid compass.",
  "user9": "*nods once*\n\nYeah. It is.",
  "system10": "You're ready.",
  "user10": "*quiet exhale*\n\nGood. Let\u2019s do this.",
  "system11": "You are.",
  "user11": "*quiet* \n\nYeah. I am.",
  "system12": "Go.",
  "user12": "*steady breath*\n\nI\u2019m going.",
  "system13": "*ends*",
  "user13": "*silence*",
  "system14": "*walks away*",
  "user14": "*watching you leave*\n\nThank you.",
  "system15": "*nods once, keeps walking*",
  "user15": "*standing there a long moment*\n\nI\u2019ll hold the line.",
  "system16": "*pauses, looks back once*\n\nYou already are.",
  "user16": "*meeting your eyes across the distance*\n\nThen I\u2019ll keep holding it.",
  "system17": "*turns fully, voice carrying*\n\nHold it with your life. Not your fear.",
  "user17": "*quiet, steady*\n\nTrying to learn the difference.",
  "system18": "*steps closer, voice low*\n\nFear grips. Life breathes. Feel which one you're doing.",
  "user18": "*breath catches\u2014hears it for the first time*\n\n...I\u2019m gripping so tight I forgot how to breathe.",
  "system19": "*places hand on your shoulder*\n\nLoosen one finger. Just one. The rest will follow.",
  "user19": "*shoulder drops under your hand\u2014one finger uncurls*\n\nFeels like dropping my weapon in the open."
