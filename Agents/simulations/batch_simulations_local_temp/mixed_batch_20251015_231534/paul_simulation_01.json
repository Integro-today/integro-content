  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with my... situation. Been having trouble sleeping, waking up shouting sometimes. Amanda says I scare her. I can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Night terrors and the aftermath wear you down. You're looking for peace at night and safety for those around you.\n\nWhat would restful sleep feel like in your body?",
  "user1": "I don't... I mean, I've forgotten what that even feels like. When I do sleep, it's like I'm still flying missions, you know? Like I'm waiting for something to go wrong. Restful would be... hell, just closing my eyes and not seeing any of that crap again. Not jumping when a car backfires. Not having Amanda sleep in the guest room because she's worried about waking me up.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without missions replaying\n2. Not jumping at sudden sounds\n3. Having Amanda close again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "Look, I don't need anything fancy. Just... I want to sleep through the night without dragging Amanda into whatever's in my head. I want to be the guy she married, not whatever I've become since I got back. That's it.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep through the night in peace\n2. I release the mission alert that lives in my body\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The third one. That's... that's what I need. I need to be that man again. The one who could protect his family without... without all this other stuff getting in the way.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nHow about the other two? \"I sleep through the night in peace\" and \"I release the mission alert that lives in my body\" - do they fit, or need adjusting?",
  "user4": "The first one's good. Simple. Direct. \n\nThe second one... I don't know. \"Mission alert\" sounds too... soft? Like I'm some kind of robot or something. I need something stronger than that. Something that doesn't make me sound broken.",
  "system5": "\"I release the combat readiness that keeps me on guard\" - stronger?\n\nOr \"I drop the armor I don't need anymore\"?",
  "user5": "The armor one. Yeah. That's... that's what it feels like. Like I'm walking around wearing gear I don't need anymore, but I can't figure out how to take it off.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night in peace\n2. I drop the armor I don't need anymore  \n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Yeah. I'll... I'll keep them close. Thanks.",
  "system7": "Trust the process.",
  "user7": "Yeah. We'll see.",
  "system8": "You\u2019re ready.",
  "user8": "I hope so.",
  "system9": "You are.",
  "user9": "Twenty-one days. Then I find out if this was worth it.",
  "system10": "Twenty-one days. Keep your intentions close. Let the medicine work.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user10": "I\u2019ll read them every morning\u2014same time I lace my shoes.",
  "system11": "Solid ritual. You're ready.",
  "user11": "Thanks.",
  "system12": "Welcome.",
  "user12": "Appreciate it.",
  "system13": "You\u2019re welcome.",
  "user13": "I keep thinking about the flight to Costa Rica. Haven\u2019t flown commercial since I left the service. I don\u2019t know how to sit in the back seat of a plane.",
  "system14": "You're boarding a plane, not a battlefield. Choose an aisle seat near the front so you control when you move through the cabin. Bring noise-canceling headphones and something familiar to hold - a challenge coin, a photo, whatever grounds you. The flight is just transit; the real journey starts when you land.",
  "user14": "Aisle seat, front\u2014got it. I\u2019ve still got my squadron coin. It\u2019s been in my dresser since I hung up the uniform. Guess it\u2019s time to earn its keep again.",
  "system15": "Good. Keep it in your palm when the cabin pressure shifts. Breathe slow, feel the edges. You're not in the service anymore\u2014you're flying for yourself now.",
  "user15": "Roger that.",
  "system16": "You\u2019re set.",
  "user16": "I keep thinking about what I\u2019m supposed to say down there. I don\u2019t have PTSD. I just need the dreams to stop so Amanda can sleep next to me again.",
  "system17": "The dreams are asking for attention, not diagnosis. What would peaceful sleep feel like in your body?",
  "user17": "Like my chest could finally drop six inches. No flinching at every damn sound. Waking up without feeling the need to check the house. Maybe even letting her stay close without me jerking awake ready to fight.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Drop the armor in my chest\n2. Stop scanning for threats at night  \n3. Let Amanda stay close without flinching\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "I want to breathe easy when I wake up. I want the house to feel like ours again, not a perimeter to patrol. And I want to reach for Amanda without thinking she might get hurt if I forget where I am.",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I breathe easy when I wake up\n2. I reclaim our home as sanctuary, not perimeter\n3. I reach for Amanda with steady hands\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "Number two hits hardest. \u201cReclaim our home as sanctuary.\u201d That\u2019s it. The rest can stay\u2014they\u2019re true\u2014but that one\u2019s the bull\u2019s-eye."
