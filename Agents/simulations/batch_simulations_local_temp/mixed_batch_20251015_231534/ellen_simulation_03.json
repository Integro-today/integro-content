  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat in a few weeks and... I don't know, I guess I just want to stop feeling like I'm always reaching for something that's not there anymore. I've built companies, sold them, checked all the boxes, but it feels hollow. Like I've been climbing the wrong mountain this whole time.",
  "system1": "That hollow feeling after reaching the summit you thought you wanted - that's its own kind of disorientation.\n\nWhen you imagine what *would* feel meaningful instead of hollow, what does that look like in your daily life?",
  "user1": "I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet way of being present that I've never been able to replicate. Even during my ayahuasca ceremonies, I kept seeing these ancestral women... they were trying to show me something about weaving together what I've built with something older, more grounded.\n\nBut then I get home and I'm back to checking emails at 5am, scheduling board meetings, barely tasting my coffee. My kids want to play and I'm thinking about valuations. It's like I can't hold onto whatever wisdom I find in these ceremonies.\n\nI guess what would feel meaningful is... I don't know, using what I've learned to actually help people instead of just making money. Being present with my family. Maybe reconnecting with my spiritual roots - my grandmother's Jewish mysticism meant something real to her, not just weekend retreats and Instagram quotes.",
  "system2": "Two main threads:\n\n1. Reconnecting with that grounded presence your grandmother embodied\n2. Using your built success to actually serve rather than just accumulate\n3. Bridging ceremony wisdom into daily life with your family\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "Wait - I think I'm missing something. You said three threads but only listed two, and honestly, I'm not even sure I know how to turn these into... whatever you call them. Intentions? They always sound so vague when I try to write them myself. Like I'm supposed to say \"I intend to be present\" or something, but that feels like words on a vision board, not something that'll actually change how I live.\n\nMy last ceremonies gave me these beautiful glimpses, but I still wake up at 5:30am reaching for my phone. How do you make an intention that actually sticks?",
  "system3": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reconnecting with that grounded presence your grandmother embodied\n2. Using your built success to actually serve rather than just accumulate  \n3. Bridging ceremony wisdom into daily life with your family\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's steady presence, putting down my phone when my children ask to play\n2. I redirect my business skills toward healing work that serves beyond profit\n3. I bring ceremony wisdom into morning coffee - tasting, breathing, being here before checking emails\n\nWhich feels most alive? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The first one hits me hard - \"putting down my phone when my children ask to play.\" That feels real. Not some abstract \"be present\" but the actual moment when Maya tugs on my sleeve while I'm scrolling through LinkedIn updates that don't matter.\n\nThe third one too... I've been drinking coffee for twenty years and I don't think I've ever actually tasted it. Just this bitter fuel that gets me to the next thing.\n\nBut the second one... I don't know. \"Healing work\" sounds too soft, like I'm supposed to become some kind of guru. That's not me. I still want to build things, solve problems, move fast - just... maybe not things that only make rich people richer. Is there a way to make that one less... I don't know, less like I'm supposed to become someone I'm not?",
  "system4": "Instead of \"healing work\" - how about \"I channel my drive toward building things that solve real problems, not just make money\"?\n\nKeeps your builder energy, just redirects the target.",
  "user4": "Yes. That feels like me - the part of me that built companies and scaled them, but pointed at something that matters. Not becoming some spiritual teacher, but using what I'm actually good at.\n\nSo... let me see if I understand how this works. These aren't goals I can fail at, right? They're more like... directions to point myself when I forget what matters?\n\nBecause I will forget. I always do.",
  "system5": "Exactly - they're directions, not destinations. You'll forget. That's given.\n\nReady to lock these in?\n\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's steady presence, putting down my phone when my children ask to play\n2. I redirect my builder energy toward solving real problems, not just making money\n3. I taste my morning coffee before checking emails",
  "user5": "Before we lock these in... I need to ask something. What if I mess this up? What if I can't hold onto these intentions when the medicine hits? I've had beautiful experiences before but they always fade. With ibogaine especially, I've heard it's... different. More intense. What if I set these intentions and then I'm just too scared or overwhelmed to remember them?\n\nI want this to be the one that actually changes something. Not just another beautiful ceremony I can't integrate.",
  "system6": "You'll forget them during ceremony. That's normal. The medicine works even when you can't remember your own name.\n\nIntentions plant seeds. They grow after, in the choices you make waking up at 5:30am.\n\nLock these in?\n\nYour intentions:\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's steady presence, putting down my phone when my children ask to play\n2. I redirect my builder energy toward solving real problems, not just making money  \n3. I taste my morning coffee before checking emails\n\nKeep them in your wallet or morning routine. These are your compass - trust what comes.",
  "user6": "Okay... okay. I trust you. \n\nThe coffee one feels like something I can actually do. Tomorrow morning, before I reach for my phone, I'll just... taste the coffee. Feel the mug in my hands. One sip. That's all.\n\nI'll write these down and keep them in my wallet - next to the kids' school photos. Seems right to keep them close.\n\nThank you. I needed this to feel concrete, not like another self-help exercise.",
  "system7": "Solid compass. The medicine will show you what you need.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "Ready feels like a strong word, but... maybe ready enough. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - how she could sit with someone and just be there, fully. No phone to check, no next thing pulling her away. I want that steadiness. Maybe this is how I find my way back to it.\n\nThanks for walking through this with me. See you on the other side.",
  "system8": "Trust the process.",
  "user8": "Trust the process. Yeah. My grandmother used to say something like that - \u201cYou plant the seeds, you water them, and then you get out of the way.\u201d\n\nAlright. Seeds planted. I\u2019ll get out of the way now.",
  "system9": "That's it. You're set.",
  "user9": "That's it. Feels strange - like I should have more to say, something profound. But maybe that's the point. No more performing.\n\nI'll carry these with me. See what grows.",
  "system10": "Exactly. No performing needed. Just show up and let it work.",
  "user10": "Just show up. That I can do.",
  "system11": "You\u2019re ready.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m ready.",
  "system12": "Good.",
  "user12": "Good.",
  "system13": "You're set.",
  "user13": "I\u2019m set.",
