  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... everything. The nightmares, Amanda saying I scare her when I wake up shouting. \n\nI'm doing this because I can't lose her. Can't lose what we built. But I don't buy into all this mystical crap. I just need to sleep through the night and stop being angry all the time.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Create safety for Amanda \n3. Release the anger that's destroying your life\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that about covers it. \n\nI need to stop waking up drenched in sweat, seeing... things. Need to stop snapping at Amanda when she doesn't deserve it. She keeps saying I scare her and I hate that more than anything. \n\nAnd this anger that builds up over nothing. I'm tired of feeling like I'm going to explode all the time.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I release the anger that controls me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I don't know about \"peacefully.\" Sounds too... soft. Like I'm asking to be some kind of monk or something.\n\nMaybe just \"I sleep through the night without the dreams.\" That's all I need. Simple.\n\nThe safety one feels right. I need that. And the anger... yeah, I need to let go of that before it destroys everything I've built.",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I release the anger that controls me\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Yeah. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system4": "Good plan. The wallet works - these intentions will be in your dashboard too, but having them in your pocket keeps them close when you need them.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user4": "Alright. Let's get this over with then. Three weeks and I'll be drinking that stuff in Costa Rica. \n\nJust hope it works. Can't keep going like this.",
  "system5": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what comes - you've set your compass.",
  "user5": "I hope you're right. I really do.",
  "system6": "Trust the process. You're doing the work - that's what matters.",
  "user6": "Yeah. We'll see.",
  "system7": "That's all any of us can do.",
  "user7": "Yeah.",
  "system8": "You're set.",
  "user8": "Alright then.",
