  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm... I mean, I've been successful at everything I've tried, but I keep coming back to this feeling that none of it matters in the bigger picture. Like I've been climbing the wrong ladder this whole time. My grandmother had this deep faith, this connection to something bigger, and I feel like I abandoned that for... what? More zeros in my bank account?\n\nI want to find a way to contribute that actually means something. Not just another profitable venture, but something that leaves the world better. And I want to be more present with my kids\u2014they're 9 and 12\u2014but I keep getting pulled back into this achievement mode, even when I'm with them.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond external achievements\n2. Reconnecting with the deeper faith/connection your grandmother embodied\n3. Being fully present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I just don't know how to turn them into something I can hold onto during the journey. \n\nI've tried meditation, journaling, all the integration practices, but they feel like more boxes to check. Like I'm trying to achieve at spirituality too. I want to stop performing and just... be real, I guess. But I don't even know what that looks like anymore.\n\nMy husband\u2014he's supportive but he doesn't really get why I keep going back to these medicines. He thinks I should be satisfied with what we have. And sometimes I wonder if he's right, if I'm just being greedy for meaning when maybe I should just be grateful.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what fulfillment looks like beyond achievements\n2. I reclaim the grounded wisdom and faith my grandmother carried\n3. I show up fully present when my kids need the real me\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user2": "The third one hits hardest. When you say it like that\u2014\"when my kids need the real me\"\u2014I feel something in my chest. Last weekend we were at the park and my daughter was trying to show me something she made, and I was checking email. I saw her face change, this disappointment... she just walked away. \n\nI keep thinking about that. How many moments have I missed? How many times have they needed me to just be there, not the version of me that's already thinking about the next thing?\n\nThe other two... I mean, they're important, but that one. That one I can't keep getting wrong.",
  "system3": "That one's locked.\n\nHow do the other two land? Want to adjust the language to match the weight of that third one?",
  "user3": "Yeah... the third one's locked. I can feel it in my bones.\n\nThe first one\u2014\"discover what fulfillment looks like beyond achievements\"\u2014it feels too... soft? Too much like another self-help thing. I need something stronger. Something that cuts through all the noise I've built around myself.\n\nAnd the second one about my grandmother... I don't want to just reclaim her wisdom. I want to understand why I walked away from it in the first place. Why I thought success meant leaving that part behind. \n\nMaybe... maybe it's more like \"I face the emptiness I've been running from and find what's real underneath all the striving.\" And for my grandmother's faith... \"I remember what I forgot when I thought success meant leaving my roots behind.\"\n\nI don't know. Does that sound right or am I just making this more complicated again?",
  "system4": "I hear you on the first one being too soft. \n\nHow about:\n1. I face the emptiness I've built and find what's real underneath\n2. I remember what I abandoned when success meant leaving my roots\n\nDo these carry more weight?",
  "user4": "Yeah... these feel heavier. Real. Like I can't just intellectualize my way out of them.\n\nThe first one\u2014I know that emptiness. It's 3am when I can't sleep and I'm staring at the ceiling wondering what the hell I'm doing with my life. It's there when I get off a board call where we just talked about quarterly projections and I feel... nothing. \n\nAnd the second one... my grandmother used to light candles on Friday nights and sing these beautiful prayers. I remember sitting on her lap, feeling so safe, so connected to something ancient. When she died during my second year of business school, I didn't even take time off. Just kept grinding. I think that's when I started believing that part of me was weakness.\n\nThese intentions... they're going to hurt. But maybe that's the point.",
  "system5": "All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I show up fully present when my kids need the real me\n2. I face the emptiness I've built and find what's real underneath  \n3. I remember what I abandoned when success meant leaving my roots\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I... I didn't expect to go there, but these feel like they're actually mine. Not something I'm supposed to want, but what I really want underneath all the noise.\n\nI'm scared. But also... ready? I think. Or as ready as I'll ever be.",
  "system6": "That's the right place to be - scared and ready. The medicine works with authentic, not perfect.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Authentic, not perfect. Yeah... that's what I keep forgetting.",
  "system7": "You'll remember when you need to.",
  "user7": "I hope you're right.",
  "system8": "The intentions you set will serve you. Trust them.",
  "user8": "I will. Or at least I'll try to remember to trust them when everything feels like it's falling apart. That's usually when I need it most.",
  "system9": "That's exactly when they'll be there - when everything falls apart. The dashboard keeps them close.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user9": "Then I'm going. Thank you... for helping me find words for things I didn't even know I needed to say.",
  "system10": "You did the work. Go well.",
  "user10": "I did, didn't I? Maybe for the first time in a long while.",
  "system11": "That's the one to remember.",
  "user11": "Yeah\u2026 that one I\u2019ll hold onto.",
  "system12": "Hold it. Let it carry you.",
  "user12": "I will.",
  "system13": "Good.",
  "user13": "I\u2019m scared, though. Not of the medicine\u2014of coming back and watching it all slip through my fingers again.",
  "system14": "That fear makes sense. Most people feel it. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they\u2019re already inside you now.",
  "user14": "Maybe that\u2019s what I needed to hear. That they\u2019re not just words on a page I\u2019ll lose in my suitcase. They\u2019re... in me now.",
  "system15": "Exactly. They're not going anywhere.",
  "user15": "Then I guess the real work starts when I get home\u2014figuring out how to keep living them when the emails start again.",
  "system16": "The real work starts there, yes. But you've already done the hardest part - choosing what matters.",
  "user16": "Choosing felt easy in this quiet room. The hard part\u2019s proving I meant it when everything starts demanding I be who I used to be.",
  "system17": "You'll forget for moments. Everyone does. The intentions will pull you back - not perfectly, but enough.",
  "user17": "I\u2019m counting on that pull. Because I can already feel the old current tugging\u2014board meetings next week, my daughter\u2019s soccer schedule, the way my phone lights up at 5:30. If the intentions don\u2019t grab me by the shirt collar, I\u2019ll drift.",
  "system18": "They'll grab you. Not every time - that's normal. But enough to keep you from drifting too far.",
  "user18": "Enough times to matter. That\u2019s all I need\u2014just enough to keep me from waking up five years from now wondering where the real me went.",
  "system19": "That's exactly how it works. Enough moments to matter, enough to keep the real you within reach.",
  "user19": "I wrote them on the back of that photo of my grandmother\u2014her candle, her book, her quiet smile. Fits in my wallet next to the Amex I keep swiping without thinking. Maybe every time I reach for plastic I\u2019ll feel paper instead."
