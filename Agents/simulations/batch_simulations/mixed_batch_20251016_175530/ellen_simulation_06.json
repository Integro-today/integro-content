  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm... I don't know. I've done this before, set intentions, but they always seem to fade after a few weeks. Like last time I did ayahuasca, I was so sure I'd found my purpose, but then I came home and... well, here I am again.\n\nI want to find something that sticks. Something that doesn't just sound good on paper but actually changes how I live. My kids are growing up fast\u2014my oldest is already twelve\u2014and I keep thinking about what I'm showing them about what matters in life.\n\nThe thing is, I don't want another business win. I've proven I can do that. I want to know that when I'm gone, I left the world better. But I'm scared that maybe I'm just chasing another achievement, you know? Like even my spiritual journey has become this thing I need to \"succeed\" at.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Living what I learn instead of just collecting insights\n2. Showing my kids what actually matters through how I live\n3. Letting go of needing to \"succeed\" at even this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I keep collecting these beautiful insights like they're trophies, then they just sit on a shelf somewhere in my mind.\n\nI want to live what I learn. Actually weave it into my days, not just my retreats. Like my grandmother's faith - she lived it in every small action, not just on holy days.\n\nFor my kids... I want them to see that success isn't just building companies and making money. That there's something deeper. But I need to show them, not tell them. Right now I'm showing them that work emails matter more than breakfast together.\n\nAnd this last one stings a bit - you're right. Even this spiritual journey, I keep thinking about how to \"win\" at it. How to be the best at being enlightened or something ridiculous like that.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I practice what I learn in small moments every day\n2. I show my kids what matters by choosing breakfast over business\n3. I release needing to succeed at even this\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits hardest. \"Choosing breakfast over business\" - that's exactly it. That's what I want to be true about me. \n\nBut... I don't know. The third one feels impossible. How do you release succeeding at something when your whole life has been about succeeding? When that's the only language you know?\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother. She never talked about success. She just... was. She'd be making challah on Friday and humming these old songs, and that was enough. She didn't need to be the best at anything. She just needed to feed her family and pray and... I don't know, be human.\n\nMaybe that's what I want. To just be human without needing to be exceptional at it.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I practice what I learn in small moments every day\n2. I choose breakfast with my kids over business, like my grandmother chose challah and humming\n3. I let myself be human instead of exceptional\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "The second one... my chest got tight when I read that. In a good way, I think. Like it caught something real. My grandmother choosing challah and humming - that's what I want to remember. That's what I want to carry forward.\n\nThe third one feels... I don't know if I'm ready for it. \"I let myself be human instead of exceptional\" - part of me wants to argue with it. Like, what's wrong with being exceptional? But that's probably the point, isn't it?\n\nThese feel more honest than anything I've written before. Less like I'm trying to impress someone with my spiritual growth, more like... like I'm actually telling the truth about what I need.\n\nI think these might be the ones.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I practice what I learn in small moments every day\n2. I choose breakfast with my kids over business, like my grandmother chose challah and humming\n3. I let myself be human instead of exceptional\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I... I feel like I've been carrying these thoughts around for months, but putting them into words like this - it makes them real somehow.\n\nMy grandmother would probably just smile and say \"of course\" if she could see these. She always knew when I was trying too hard to be impressive.\n\nI guess we'll see what happens next.",
  "system5": "She sounds like she knew the real you. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "She did. She always saw right through me - in the best way. When I'd show up with some big achievement, she'd just pat my cheek and ask if I was eating enough. Nothing I could do impressed her, but everything I was delighted her.\n\nI miss that. I miss being seen like that.\n\nI think... I think that's what I'm really looking for in all this. Not to be exceptional, but to be seen. Like she saw me.",
  "system6": "That's it. She saw you - not your achievements, just you. These intentions point toward that same seeing.\n\nThe medicine will work with what you've set. Trust it.",
  "user6": "I will. It's funny - I've spent my whole life building things that matter, companies that change healthcare, investments that make money. But this... these three simple lines feel like the most important thing I've ever built.\n\nMaybe that's the point. Maybe this is what I'm supposed to be building now - a life where I'm seen, where I see myself.\n\nThank you for helping me find the words.",
  "system7": "You found them. I just helped you shape what was already there.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user7": "I guess I did, didn't I? After all these years of searching, turns out I had the compass all along. Just needed to remember how to read it.\n\nThank you. For the space, for the questions, for not letting me get away with the easy answers.",
  "system8": "You're ready.",
  "user8": "I am.",
  "system9": "Good.",
  "user9": "Ellen, it's been a few weeks since we set your intentions. How are they landing as you move toward your journey?",
  "system10": "I\u2019m not Ellen, and you\u2019re talking to Tegra now.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve got a ceremony coming up and want to refresh or reset your compass, let\u2019s do it. Otherwise, the intentions you locked are still guiding\u2014you can check them any time on your dashboard.",
  "user10": "Got it\u2014thanks, Tegra. I\u2019ll keep the dashboard in sight and reach out if the compass needs any recalibration before wheels-up.",
  "system11": "Sounds right.",
  "user11": "Sounds right.",
  "system12": "Keep the line open.",
  "user12": "Always.",
  "system13": "Good.",
  "user13": "I\u2019m here when you need me.",
  "system14": "Same.",
  "user14": "Likewise.",
  "system15": "Clear skies ahead.",
  "user15": "Clear skies.",
  "system16": "You\u2019re set.",
  "user16": "Got it.",
