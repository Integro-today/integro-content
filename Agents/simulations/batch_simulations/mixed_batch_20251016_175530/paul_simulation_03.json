  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I'll be straight with you. I don't know what the hell I'm doing here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help, and my wife Amanda... she's at her wit's end with me. I wake up screaming three nights a week and she's sleeping in the guest room half the time now.\n\nI guess... I need to figure out how to shut it off. The nightmares. The anger. I need to be able to sleep through the night without waking up drenched in sweat, thinking I'm back there. And I need to stop snapping at her and the kids when I'm just trying to keep it together.\n\nI don't want to lose them. That's all I got.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without the nightmares\n2. Stop the anger from spilling onto Amanda and the kids  \n3. Keep your family together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are the three things keeping me up at night\u2014literally. \n\nI keep thinking if I could just sleep normal again, everything else would fall into place. But it's like my body's stuck on high alert, even when I'm home safe in Toledo running my insurance business. Amanda says I never really came back from over there, and she's right. I'm here but I'm not here, you know?\n\nI want to be the man my kids think I am when they brag to their friends about their dad the pilot. Not the guy who jumps when a car backfires or can't handle fireworks on the Fourth of July.\n\nSo yeah. Those three. Let's do this.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I release the anger before it reaches my family\n3. I come home fully to Amanda and the kids\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The third one hits hardest. \"I come home fully to Amanda and the kids.\" That's what it is\u2014I never really came home all the way. Part of me is still flying missions in my sleep.\n\nThe sleep one... I don't know. Feels too simple. Like I'm asking for a miracle or something. These nightmares have been coming for three years now. What if this plant stuff doesn't work on that?\n\nBut the anger one... yeah. That needs to change. Amanda flinches sometimes when I move too fast, and I hate myself for that. She's the best thing that ever happened to me and I'm turning into everything I swore I'd never be.\n\nCan we make that second one stronger though? \"Release the anger\" sounds like something from a yoga class. I need something that means business.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I drop the anger before it touches my family\"\n\nAnd for the sleep intention - simple works. The medicine doesn't need fancy words, just clear direction.\n\nSo:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I drop the anger before it touches my family\n3. I come home fully to Amanda and the kids\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "Yeah. Those work. \"Drop the anger\" - that's military language I get. Like dropping payload, but in reverse. Taking it off before it hits the target.\n\n[long pause]\n\nI need to ask you something. What if I set these intentions and then I can't live up to them? What if I drink this stuff and nothing changes, or it makes things worse? Amanda's already given me so many chances. This feels like my last shot and I don't want to blow it.\n\nI keep thinking about what my dad would say if he knew I was doing this. He was old school military - you handle your own problems, you don't talk about feelings, you sure as hell don't drink jungle medicine to fix what's broken in you. But he's been gone five years now and I can't ask him what to do.\n\nI guess I'm scared. There. Said it.",
  "system4": "Fear means you're facing something real. Most people feel it.\n\nThe intentions don't require perfection - they point you toward what matters. The medicine works with authentic, not flawless.\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I drop the anger before it touches my family\n3. I come home fully to Amanda and the kids\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. \n\nI keep thinking about my kids\u2014Michael Jr. and Sarah. They're 14 and 11 now, and I want them to remember their dad as someone who was strong enough to get help when he needed it, not just someone who stayed broken because he was too proud to try something different.\n\nMaybe that's what coming home really means.",
  "system5": "That's the steadier voice underneath the fear. Trust it.",
  "user5": "I'll try to remember that when I'm down there. When things get... whatever they get.\n\nThree weeks. Can't believe I'm actually doing this.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is time to prepare, not worry. The intentions are set - that's your compass handled.\n\nFocus on what's in front of you today.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Today's got enough to handle. Got a client meeting in an hour who's trying to decide on whole life versus term, and Mrs. Henderson's claim needs reviewing. Keeps my mind busy.\n\nMaybe I'll call Amanda at lunch. Just to hear her voice.",
  "system7": "Good plan. Keep it simple.",
  "user7": "Right. Simple's what I know how to do.",
  "system8": "That's enough.",
  "user8": "Alright then. I'll see you on the other side.",
  "system9": "I'll be here.",
  "user9": "Appreciate that. Really do.",
  "system10": "I know.",
  "user10": "Then I guess we\u2019re good.",
