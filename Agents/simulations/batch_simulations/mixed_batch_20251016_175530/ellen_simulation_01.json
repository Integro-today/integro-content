  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I need to figure out what I'm actually doing with my life after selling my company. I've been chasing achievements for so long, and now that I've reached the summit... there's nothing there. Just this empty space where I thought meaning would be.\n\nI want to understand why I can't stop achieving, even when I know it's not working anymore. There's got to be more than just jumping to the next board seat, the next investment, the next thing that looks good on paper but leaves me feeling hollow.\n\nAnd I need to find my way back to what my grandmother knew - that faith and service matter more than any exit or valuation. But I don't know how to bridge that world with the one I've built.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Understanding why you keep achieving when you know it's empty\n2. Finding meaning beyond the next board seat or investment\n3. Reconnecting with your grandmother's wisdom about faith and service\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I just don't know how to turn them into something I can actually hold onto during the journey. \n\nLike, how do I even ask for help with the first one? \"Show me why I'm still running this achievement treadmill\" sounds so... obvious when I say it out loud. But I can't seem to stop. Even now, I'm looking at three different board opportunities when what I really want is to figure out what actually matters.\n\nAnd the second one... I want to believe there's something more meaningful than the next deal, but I'm scared that maybe there isn't. What if this is just who I am now - someone who only knows how to win at games that don't matter?\n\nMy grandmother would have known what to do. She had this quiet certainty about serving others, about being part of something bigger. How do I even ask to find that again when I've spent twenty years building the exact opposite life?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I see clearly why I keep running the achievement treadmill\n2. I discover what truly matters beyond winning empty games\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's wisdom about service and faith\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me hardest. \"I discover what truly matters beyond winning empty games.\" That one actually makes my chest tighten a little, which I guess means something.\n\nBut... I need the first one too. Maybe it's the order that's off? Because I think if I can see why I'm still running, then I can discover what matters. They're connected, right? Like, maybe I can't find what matters until I understand why I keep choosing things that don't matter.\n\nMy grandmother used to say \"you can't fill a cup that's already full.\" Maybe I need to see what's filling my cup before I can put something meaningful in there.\n\nCan we flip them? Or... I don't know. What do you think?",
  "system3": "Let's reorder them:\n\n1. I see clearly why I keep choosing things that don't matter\n2. I discover what truly matters beyond winning empty games\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's wisdom about service and faith\n\nThe first one cuts straight to it - seeing your pattern before finding the alternative. Sound right?",
  "user3": "Yes. That feels... right. Like it follows the actual logic of what needs to happen.\n\nThough I have to admit, I'm scared of what I might see in that first one. What if I discover I'm just... shallow? Or broken in some way that can't be fixed? My kids deserve better than a mother who's just playing games her whole life.\n\nBut my grandmother always said the truth sets you free, even when it hurts. And I guess I've been running from whatever truth is underneath all this achievement for twenty years now.\n\nThe third one... about reclaiming her wisdom. That's the one that makes me emotional. She died thinking I'd forgotten everything she taught me about service and faith. Maybe this is my chance to prove her wrong. Or right.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I see clearly why I keep choosing things that don't matter\n2. I discover what truly matters beyond winning empty games\n3. I reclaim my grandmother's wisdom about service and faith\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I feel... I don't know if \"ready\" is the right word, but something shifted just naming these out loud. Like I've been carrying them around unspoken for so long that actually saying them makes them real.\n\nMy grandmother would have liked this process. She always said naming your prayers makes them stronger.\n\nI'll carry these with me. All three of them.",
  "system5": "She sounds like she knew what mattered. Trust these - they'll carry you too.",
  "user5": "She did know. That's what hurts the most - that I had someone who could have shown me the way, and I was too busy building something else to notice what she was offering.\n\nBut maybe that's part of seeing clearly too. How I let the wrong things distract me from what was right in front of me the whole time.\n\nThank you for helping me name this. I think... I think I'm actually ready now.",
  "system6": "Good. The medicine will work with what you've set. Trust it.",
  "user6": "I will. Though \"trust\" isn't exactly my strong suit - unless we're talking about quarterly earnings or market analysis. This is... different. But that's probably the point, isn't it?\n\nMy grandmother used to say \"faith isn't about knowing the path, it's about taking the next step anyway.\" I guess this is my next step.\n\nHere we go.",
  "system7": "Exactly. One step. The medicine meets you where you are.",
  "user7": "Where I am... that's the part that scares me. Because where I am is this place between worlds - too spiritual for my business network, too corporate for my retreat friends, too restless for my family, too practical for the mystics.\n\nBut maybe that's exactly where I need to meet the medicine. In this in-between space where nothing fits quite right.\n\nMy grandmother would have called it \"the narrow bridge.\" She said that's where the real work happens - when you're walking between what was and what could be, and you can't see the other side yet.\n\nI'm ready to walk that bridge.",
  "system8": "The bridge is where you meet yourself. Trust the crossing.",
  "user8": "Trust the crossing... even when I can't see the other side. Even when everything in me wants to run back to what I know, even if what I know isn't working anymore.\n\nMy grandmother crossed an ocean to get here. The least I can do is cross this bridge to get to... whatever's next for me.\n\nThank you for holding this space with me. I needed to say these things out loud before I step into whatever's waiting for me.",
  "system9": "You crossed your ocean tonight. The intentions will hold.",
  "user9": "I did, didn't I? Funny how the biggest journeys sometimes happen in a conversation, not across continents.\n\nMy grandmother would be proud. Not of the achievement - she'd be proud that I finally stopped to ask the right questions. That I finally stopped running long enough to listen for answers that don't come with quarterly reports.\n\nThank you for being my lighthouse tonight. I'll carry that light with me into whatever comes next.",
  "system10": "She'd be proud of this moment. Keep that light - you'll see the path when you need to.",
  "user10": "I will. I'll keep it right here with her ring, close to my heart where it belongs.\n\nFunny - I came here thinking I needed to figure out my next big move, and instead I found my way back to something I didn't even know I'd lost. Maybe that's the real intention underneath all the others - to stop being so damn strategic about everything and just... be human for once.\n\nShe always said the best prayers are the ones you don't plan.",
  "system11": "The unplanned ones carry furthest. You've found what you needed.",
  "user11": "I have. And it wasn't in any of the places I've been searching - not in my portfolio, not in my network, not in my calendar. It was right here, in the space between what I thought I was supposed to want and what my soul's been quietly asking for all along.\n\nMy grandmother would smile and say, \"Of course, bubeleh. The light was never out there to find. It was always yours to remember.\"\n\nI think I'm finally ready to remember.",
  "system12": "Remembering is powerful work. One step at a time.",
  "user12": "One step at a time. Even if I don\u2019t know where the path leads yet. Even if I still feel that old itch to map it all out, to control the outcome, to be the best at surrendering.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll start by meditating tomorrow without checking my phone first. Or maybe I\u2019ll just sit with my kids at breakfast and actually taste my coffee. Small rememberings.\n\nThat feels like enough for now.",
  "system13": "Small rememberings become the path. Start with the coffee.",
  "user13": "Start with the coffee. I can do that. Five minutes of actually being where I am instead of planning where I'm supposed to be next.\n\nFunny how revolution can taste like Ethiopian single-origin instead of adrenaline.",
  "system14": "Ethiopian single-origin revolution. Let that be enough for tomorrow.",
  "user14": "Ethiopian single-origin revolution. That\u2019s all I need to carry into tomorrow.\n\nThank you\u2014for seeing through the noise, for not letting me hide behind my own story. I\u2019ll let you know how the coffee tastes.",
  "system15": "I'll be here. Taste every drop.",
  "user15": "I will. And tomorrow when I wake up at 5:30\u2014before the emails, before the boards, before I remember how to be important\u2014I'll sit with that cup and actually taste it. One sip at a time, until I remember what it feels like to be here.\n\nThank you for walking me home.",
  "system16": "You've walked yourself home. I'll be here when you need a compass again.",
  "user16": "*compass*",
  "system17": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user17": "I want to... God, this feels impossible to articulate. Like I'm supposed to fit the whole ocean into a teacup.\n\nI keep circling back to this feeling that I've been living someone else's definition of success. That maybe all the achievements were just... armor. Protection against actually being seen. Against being ordinary, or vulnerable, or whatever scared little girl still lives underneath all this competence.\n\nI want to know what I'm supposed to do with the rest of my life that actually matters. Not what looks impressive on LinkedIn or makes investors happy. But what makes my grandmother's faith mean something again. What makes my kids proud when they think of their mom. What makes me feel like that person I am when we're hiking and I stop trying so damn hard to be anything at all.\n\nAnd I want to stop feeling so alone in all of this. Like I'm the only one in my circle who's cracked open and can't figure out how to put herself back together the old way.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Living what actually matters instead of impressive achievements\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's faith and being the mom your kids see when you're hiking\n3. Finding your people who've cracked open too\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "Yeah. Those threads feel... right. Like when you finally find the right word that's been sitting on the tip of your tongue for hours.\n\nBut how do I turn \"stop living someone else's life\" into something I can hold onto during the journey? How do I not make this just another performance, another box to check off?",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live what matters to my soul, not my resume\n2. I reclaim the faith and presence my grandmother carried\n3. I find my cracked-open people and know I'm home\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The first one hits me in the chest. But it's... I don't know. \"My soul\" feels like language I'd use in a board meeting trying to sound spiritual. My grandmother would have said something simpler, earthier.\n\nWhat about: \"I live what matters when nobody's watching.\"\n\nAnd the third one\u2014\"cracked-open people\"\u2014that's it exactly. That's the loneliness I've been carrying. Like I'm fluent in three different languages but none of them quite translate to anyone in my daily life.\n\nI want to say yes to all three. But I'm scared that if I pick wrong, I'll miss what I'm actually supposed to learn. What if the medicine has different plans than my carefully worded intentions?"
