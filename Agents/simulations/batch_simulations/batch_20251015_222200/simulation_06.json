  "system0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with my nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up shouting and scaring Amanda like this.",
  "user0": "I hear you - the nightmares are taking a toll on both of you, and you're willing to try anything that might bring some peace. That desperation mixed with hope is a hard place to be.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your ayahuasca journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. Intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving everything to chance.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your ceremony:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're hoping to heal or understand about these nightmares and the trauma behind them. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with trauma and nightmares, plus examples from other veterans first.\n\nWhich feels better to start with?",
  "system1": "I don't like talking about this stuff. Never have. But... I guess option A. I need to figure out what the hell I'm doing here.",
  "user1": "Fair enough - talking about this stuff isn't easy, especially when you've spent years keeping it locked down. I appreciate you being here anyway.\n\nLet's start simple. When you think about these nightmares, what do you wish would change? Not just stopping them, but what would feeling peaceful look like for you?",
  "system2": "Peaceful? I just want to sleep through the night without waking up drenched in sweat. Without seeing... without remembering what I saw over there. I want to be able to close my eyes without worrying about what waits for me.",
  "user2": "That makes complete sense - just wanting to close your eyes without dread, to sleep without being dragged back to those memories. No wonder you're exhausted.\n\nWhen you say \"what I saw over there\" - are the nightmares specifically about those combat experiences, or has it all blurred together into something else now?",
  "system3": "They're mostly about the missions. The ones that went sideways. Sometimes it's like I'm back in the cockpit, sometimes I'm watching it happen from outside my body. But it's always the same outcome - people die and I couldn't stop it. Couldn't save them.",
  "user3": "That weight of watching people die while feeling powerless to stop it - no wonder your mind keeps replaying it. Like you're still stuck in that moment where everything went wrong.\n\nBesides the sleep, what do you wish you could change about how you carry those memories day to day?",
  "system4": "I just... I want to stop feeling like I'm about to explode all the time. Like there's this pressure building up and I can't let it out. Amanda says I walk around like I'm still in combat mode, scanning for threats. I want to be able to relax in my own damn house.",
  "user4": "Always being on high alert in your own home - that's no way to live. Like you can't ever stand down, even when you're supposed to be safe.\n\nWhat would it feel like to let that pressure go, even just a little? How would Amanda respond if she saw you truly relaxed?",
  "system5": "She'd probably think something was wrong with me. It's been so long since she's seen me... normal. I used to laugh more. She'd probably cry if she saw me actually relaxed. Happy crying, I mean. Not the other kind.",
  "user5": "She's probably holding onto memories of who you were before all this - that version of you who could laugh without the weight you're carrying now.\n\nWhen you think about this ayahuasca journey, what are you hoping it might show you or help you understand about all this?",
  "system6": "I don't know. Heroic Hearts says it can help with... processing trauma. But I don't want to lose who I am. I just want to stop feeling like I'm drowning in it. Maybe understand why I can't let it go when others seem to.",
  "user6": "Not wanting to lose yourself while letting go of the drowning feeling - that's a powerful distinction. Like you want to keep the parts that served you, just not the parts that are destroying you now.\n\nWhat's the hardest part about watching others move forward while you feel stuck carrying this?",
  "system7": "Makes me feel weak. Like maybe I'm not as strong as I thought. Some of the guys, they talk about their stuff, get help, and they seem better. I can't... I just can't. Never could. Always been the one who holds it together. If I fall apart... then what?",
  "user7": "Being the one who always holds it together - that's a heavy role to carry alone. Like if you let the cracks show, everything might crumble.\n\nBut what if falling apart isn't weakness? What if it's just... finally putting down something that's too heavy to keep carrying by yourself?",
  "system8": "Then I'm letting everyone down. My family, the guys who didn't make it back... hell, even myself. I don't know how to be any other way than this. This is who I am.",
  "user8": "I hear you - this identity feels like it's the only version of you that exists anymore. Like if you stop being the guy who holds it all together, you're somehow betraying everyone, including yourself.\n\nBut what if who you are is bigger than just this one way of surviving? What if there's still room for the part of you that Amanda misses - the part that used to laugh?",
  "system9": "I don't even remember how to find that guy anymore. He's been gone so long... feels like a stranger. But I want to. God, I want to. Just don't know if there's anything left of him.",
  "user9": "That wanting - that's something real still alive in you. Not the old version you think is gone forever, but something new that remembers what it felt like to be more than just survival mode.\n\nLet me help you set some intentions for this journey. An intention is like a compass - it points toward what matters without forcing where you'll end up. \n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're hoping to heal or discover. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\nOption B: I can share more about how intention-setting works first, with examples from others who've faced similar struggles.\n\nWhich feels better?",
  "system10": "Option A. I don't need more theory. I need to figure out what the hell I'm even doing this for. Can't believe I'm even considering this plant medicine stuff... but here we are.",
  "user10": "Here you are - showing up for something you never thought you'd consider. That tells me something important is still fighting for you, even if you can't see it clearly yet.\n\nSo let's get practical. When you imagine coming out the other side of this ceremony, what would feel different? Not some big transformation - just... what would feel like progress to you?",
  "system11": "Maybe... maybe if I could just sleep through the night. Wake up without feeling like I'm back there. Not jump when the kids drop something. Be able to sit through a movie without needing to get up and move around. Small stuff like that.",
  "user11": "Those small things - sleeping through the night, not flinching at every sound, being able to just sit still - they're huge when you've been living in survival mode. They're the difference between being alive and actually living.\n\nWhat's it like for your kids, seeing you jumpy like that? Do they know why, or is this something you've kept from them?",
  "system12": "They don't know. I mean, they know Dad's got rules about loud noises in the house, but they think it's just... me being strict. My youngest, she dropped a pan last month and I was across the room before I even knew what happened. Scared her. Amanda saw the whole thing. The look on her face... like she didn't know who I was for a second.",
  "user12": "That moment when Amanda looked at you like you were a stranger - that had to cut deep. Like you're watching yourself become someone even your wife doesn't recognize.\n\nWhat do you think she was seeing in that moment? Not just the jump, but something deeper maybe?",
  "system13": "She saw the guy who came back from over there. Not the husband she married. Not the dad who used to wrestle with them on the floor. Just... this wound-up thing that can't relax in his own house. She looked scared of me. And I hate that more than anything.",
  "user13": "More than anything, you hate being someone your family fears in their own home. That tells me everything about what really matters to you - not the tough guy stuff, but being safe for them to be around.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding peace with your nervous system - sleeping through the night, not jumping at every sound\n2. Reconnecting with being present and safe for your family, especially Amanda \n3. Reclaiming some part of yourself that's not just defined by what happened over there\n\nDoes that capture what matters most?",
  "system14": "Yeah. That's... yeah, that's it. I just want to be the guy they deserve to have. Not this... whatever I've turned into.",
  "user14": "Based on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to releasing the tension that keeps me on high alert, making space for peace in my own home\n2. I seek to reclaim the version of myself that my family feels safe to love and be loved by\n3. I welcome the process of becoming who my wife and children deserve to have in their lives\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system15": "The second one. That one hits different. \"Reclaim the version of myself that my family feels safe to love.\" That's... that's exactly what I need.",
  "user15": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I seek to reclaim the version of myself that my family feels safe to love and be loved by\n\nThat shift from \"safe to love\" to \"safe to love and be loved by\" - you added that part about receiving love too. That's important, isn't it? Not just being safe for them, but letting them love you back.\n\nLet's move to intention 2. What's calling to you about releasing that constant alertness?",
  "system16": "I just want to be able to breathe in my own house. Not be scanning every corner, waiting for something to go wrong. Maybe then I could sit through dinner without my shoulders up around my ears.",
  "user16": "Being able to breathe in your own house - that's not asking much, but it feels impossible when your body's always braced for attack.\n\nHow about: \"I open myself to releasing the constant vigilance, making space to breathe freely in my own home\"?\n\nHow does that land with you?",
  "system17": "Yeah. That's good. I need that one.",
  "user17": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I open myself to releasing the constant vigilance, making space to breathe freely in my own home\n\nNow for the third one - becoming who your family deserves. What does that look like to you? Not the perfect version, but the real version they actually need?",
  "system18": "Just... someone who doesn't snap when the kids are being loud. Who can sit on the couch with Amanda without feeling like I need to be doing something useful. Someone who can be there, really be there, without this pressure building up all the time.",
  "user18": "So it's about being able to just *be* with them - not productive, not on edge, just present and steady.\n\nHow about: \"I welcome becoming someone who can be fully present with my family, released from the pressure that makes me snap or need to stay busy\"?\n\nDoes that capture what you're after?",
  "system19": "Yeah. That works. I just want to be able to sit with them and not feel like I'm gonna crawl out of my skin.",
  "user19": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I welcome becoming someone who can be fully present with my family, released from the pressure that makes me snap or need to stay busy\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card you keep with your wallet or keys\n- Record yourself reading them to play before bed\n- Keep them where you see family photos\n- Read them during your morning routine\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when things get hard?"
