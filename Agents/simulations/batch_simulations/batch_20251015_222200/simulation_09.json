  "system0": "Look, I got this Heroic Hearts retreat coming up in three weeks\u2014ayahuasca thing in Costa Rica. Amanda says I either deal with whatever's eating me or we're done, so here I am.",
  "user0": "I hear you - there's a lot riding on this, and the pressure to \"fix\" things fast can feel overwhelming. Coming to ayahuasca under relationship pressure takes guts.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. Intentions help guide the experience toward healing and growth, rather than leaving everything to chance. They're different from rigid goals because they allow space for surprises and unexpected healing.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your ceremony:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through a conversational process where we'll explore what's really eating at you and what healing might look like. Together we'll craft 3 intentions that feel authentic.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with ayahuasca and examples from others first.\n\nWhich would you like to explore?",
  "system1": "I don't need examples or stories. Just... let's get to it. I need this to work.",
  "user1": "Understood. Let's get straight to it.\n\nWhat brought you to this retreat? Beyond Amanda's ultimatum - what do you hope to heal or understand about yourself?",
  "system2": "I wake up yelling in the middle of the night. Amanda says I scare her. I don't remember the dreams, but I'm drenched in sweat and my heart's pounding like I'm back there. I just... I need it to stop. I need to sleep through the night without jumping out of bed ready to fight. That's all.",
  "user2": "That sounds exhausting - living in that constant state of alert, even in your sleep. No wonder you're desperate for it to stop.\n\nWhat do you think you're back there in those moments? Where does your body think you are?",
  "system3": "I don't know\u2014it's not like I see anything clear. Just... noise. Pressure. Like the world's caving in and I gotta move or die. Sometimes I smell jet fuel. Sometimes it's Amanda's voice cutting through, telling me it's okay, I'm home, but I'm still ready to throw a punch at the dark.",
  "user3": "Your body remembers what your mind won't let you see - that jet fuel smell, the cave-in feeling, the need to fight or die. Your nervous system's still on patrol, protecting you from something that happened back then.\n\nWhat do you need most from this healing? Is it peace from the nightmares, or something deeper about what caused them?",
  "system4": "I need the nightmares gone so Amanda can sleep beside me without flinching. That's first. If there's something deeper... maybe I need to look at it without it swallowing me. I can't have my kids seeing me like this\u2014jumping at shadows. I just need to be steady again.",
  "user4": "I hear you - needing to be steady for your family, to stop the cycle of jumping at shadows. Your kids deserve to feel safe with you, and you deserve to feel safe in your own skin.\n\nBeyond stopping the nightmares, what would being \"steady\" look like for you? How would you know you'd found it?",
  "system5": "No more waking up ready to fight. No more snapping at Amanda when she asks a simple question. I'd come home and sit on the porch with her without feeling like I gotta keep moving. Maybe I could close my eyes in church without hearing engines. Just... normal, I guess. Like I was before I left.",
  "user5": "Before you left - that version of you who could sit still, close his eyes in church, not snap at simple questions. That man who felt safe enough to just be.\n\nWhat's the hardest part about looking at what happened back then - the thing that made you leave that steady version of yourself behind?",
  "system6": "I\u2019m not looking to dig up war stories. I did my job, I came home, end of story. Other guys had it worse\u2014lost limbs, lost their minds. I\u2019m fine. I just need the noise to stop so I can be who I was.",
  "user6": "Fair enough - you're not here to relive it, just to get back to who you were before. The guy who could sit on the porch without scanning for threats.\n\nI'm hearing two core threads:\n\n1. Finding peace from the nightmares so you can sleep through the night\n2. Becoming steady again - the you who could sit still without needing to move or fight\n\nDoes that capture what matters most for your journey?",
  "system7": "Yeah. That\u2019s it. I need the nights quiet and the days steady.",
  "user7": "Based on those threads, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep through the night, free from the noise that drives me from bed\n2. I reclaim the steady man who can sit still beside Amanda without scanning for threats\n3. I open myself to releasing what keeps my body ready to fight when I'm safe at home\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system8": "Number two hits closest. I want that steady man back\u2014the one Amanda married, the one my kids deserve. Can we make it stronger, though? Something like: I reclaim the steady man who can sit still and present with Amanda and the kids, no longer prisoner to the noise.",
  "user8": "I reclaim the steady man who can sit still and present with Amanda and the kids, no longer prisoner to the noise\n\nThat's powerful - the shift from being a prisoner to reclaiming. How does this feel as your first intention?",
  "system9": "Feels right. That\u2019s the one.",
  "user9": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I reclaim the steady man who can sit still and present with Amanda and the kids, no longer prisoner to the noise\n\nNow for the second one - you mentioned needing the nights quiet so Amanda can sleep without flinching. How would you phrase that intention?",
  "system10": "I welcome peaceful nights and quiet sleep, so Amanda can rest beside me without fear.",
  "user10": "I welcome peaceful nights and quiet sleep, so Amanda can rest beside me without fear\n\nThat's beautiful - how Amanda's peace becomes part of your own healing. Does this feel right as your second intention?",
  "system11": "Yeah. One more\u2014something about keeping the strength that kept me alive without letting it run the house.",
  "user11": "I embrace the strength that kept me alive, using it only when needed\u2014not letting it run my house\n\nHow does that capture what you're seeking?",
  "system12": "Close. Let's tighten it: I honor the strength that kept me alive, choosing when to use it, not letting it choose for me.",
  "user12": "I honor the strength that kept me alive, choosing when to use it, not letting it choose for me\n\nThat shift from being controlled to being in control - from reactive to choosing. Does this feel complete as your third intention?",
  "system13": "It does.",
  "user13": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I honor the strength that kept me alive, choosing when to use it, not letting it choose for me\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet or pocket\n- Record yourself reading them and play it during your commute\n- Write them in your journal each morning\n- Keep them where you see Amanda's photo\n\nWhat feels right to help you hold onto these when things get hard?",
  "system14": "I\u2019ll write them on the back of my dog tags. Been hangin\u2019 on my rear-view mirror since Kandahar.",
  "user14": "That's perfect - those tags have carried you through everything, and now they'll carry these intentions too.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I reclaim the steady man who can sit still and present with Amanda and the kids, no longer prisoner to the noise\n2. I welcome peaceful nights and quiet sleep, so Amanda can rest beside me without fear  \n3. I honor the strength that kept me alive, choosing when to use it, not letting it choose for me\n\nYour ritual: Writing them on the back of your dog tags\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you strength and peace on this journey, soldier.",
  "system15": "Appreciate it.",
  "user15": "You're welcome. Those intentions are solid\u2014carry them well.",
  "system16": "Copy that.",
  "user16": "Roger that. You\u2019ve got what you need\u2014now go do the work.",
  "system17": "Copy.",
  "user17": "*quiet nod*",
  "system18": "I\u2019m heading out\u2014see you on the other side.",
  "user18": "See you on the other side. Safe travels.",
