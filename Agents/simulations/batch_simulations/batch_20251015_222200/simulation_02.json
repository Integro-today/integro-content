  "system0": "Look, I got this Heroic Hearts retreat coming up in three weeks and I need to figure out what I'm supposed to want from it. Amanda says I need to do something or we're gonna lose what we got.",
  "user0": "I hear the urgency in your voice - three weeks feels tight when there's something important at stake with Amanda, and you're under pressure to \"figure out what to want.\" That weight of potentially losing what you have together... that's real.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific outcome. With psilocybin, intentions help guide the experience toward healing and growth, rather than leaving it all to chance. They're different from rigid goals because they allow space for surprises and unexpected insights.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your Heroic Hearts retreat:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what's happening with Amanda and what you're hoping to heal or understand. Together we'll build intentions that feel authentic to your situation.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works and examples from others first, then we can craft yours.\n\nWhich feels right to you right now?",
  "system1": "It's ayahuasca, not psilocybin. And I don't need examples from other people - their problems aren't mine. \n\nI just... I need to stop waking up screaming. And I need Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm about to explode. That's it.",
  "user1": "You're right - it's ayahuasca, and your reasons are your own. Waking up screaming and seeing that fear in Amanda's eyes... that's exhausting. Living with that constant tension.\n\nLet me ask - when you wake up screaming, what are you seeing? Or is it more the feeling that stays with you?",
  "system2": "I don't know. It's just... noise and fire and trying to keep the bird in the air. Sometimes it's Hicks screaming on the radio. Sometimes it's just black smoke everywhere. \n\nBut it's not like I'm back there - I'm here, in our bed, and Amanda's jumping back like I'm gonna hit her or something. I never would. But I can't... I can't make it stop.",
  "user2": "The bird stays in the air but you're the one crashing - into your bedroom, into Amanda's fear, into the space between who you were there and who you are here. That disconnect between never wanting to hurt her and watching her flinch anyway... that's its own kind of torture.\n\nWhat do you think would need to happen for Amanda to stop looking at you like that? Not the logistics, but deep down - what would need to change in how she sees you, or how you see yourself?",
  "system3": "I don't know. Maybe if I could just... be normal again. Like before. When she could sleep next to me without worrying I'm gonna wake up swinging.\n\nI used to be the guy who fixed things. Now I'm the thing that needs fixing.",
  "user3": "That shift from being the fixer to feeling like the broken thing - that's a hard identity to carry. And \"normal again\" makes sense when you're trying to get back to who you were before you had to keep birds in the air through fire and smoke.\n\nBut I'm curious - when you imagine being able to sleep peacefully next to Amanda, what does that version of you look like? Not the old you, but someone who carries whatever you've seen without it spilling out in the middle of the night?",
  "system4": "I don't know what that looks like. I just know I want her to feel safe next to me again. Like she can close her eyes and not wonder if I'm gonna wake up shouting about things she can't see.\n\nMaybe if I could just... let it go. Whatever's stuck in my head. But I don't know how to do that without losing who I am.",
  "user4": "That fear of losing who you are while trying to let go of what's stuck - that's real. You're not just carrying memories, you're carrying the responsibility of keeping that bird flying, keeping Hicks alive on the radio, keeping everyone safe. Letting go might feel like abandoning that duty.\n\nWhat if you could put that weight down without putting down the parts that make you *you* - the loyalty, the protectiveness, the strength? What would that middle ground look like?",
  "system5": "I don't know if that exists. Either I'm the guy who gets things done, who protects his people, or I'm... what? Some civilian who can't even protect his own wife from his nightmares?\n\nI need to be strong for them. Always have been. That's not negotiable.",
  "user5": "That line between \"protector who gets things done\" and \"civilian who can't protect his wife\" - you see it as either/or, but strength that protects doesn't have to mean strength that terrifies. \n\nWhat if being strong for Amanda now looks different than being strong for your unit then? What if the protection she needs most is being able to sleep without jumping back from you?",
  "system6": "I hear what you're saying. I just... I don't know how to be that guy. The one who doesn't wake up ready for a fight. The one who can just... sleep.\n\nBut if I could figure that out - if this plant stuff can help me figure that out - then maybe Amanda stops being afraid of me. Maybe I stop being the thing she has to protect herself from.",
  "user6": "That recognition - that Amanda's afraid *of you*, not just for you - that's heavy. And wanting to stop being the thing she needs protection from... that's where we can start building something.\n\nLet me ask this: when you say \"figure that out,\" what would success look like? Not the process, but the result - what would be different about how you move through your days, your nights, your relationship with Amanda?",
  "system7": "I guess... I wake up without the dreams. Without the yelling. Without her jumping out of bed and standing across the room looking at me like I'm a stranger.\n\nMaybe I could just... be there with her. Not on edge. Not waiting for something to go wrong. Just present. Like a normal husband.",
  "user7": "That vision of just *being there* with her - not on edge, not waiting for the next threat, just present as her husband - that's powerful. It's not about becoming someone else, it's about being able to stay in the room with her, literally and emotionally.\n\nWhat would it mean for you to feel safe enough in your own body that Amanda could feel safe next to you again?",
  "system8": "I don't know if I can answer that. Safe in my own body? That doesn't even make sense to me. My body is just... the thing that gets me through the day. Through the mission.\n\nBut if I could... if I could just stop feeling like I need to be ready to fight all the time. Like I could close my eyes and not feel like I'm letting my guard down. Maybe then she could relax too.",
  "user8": "That constant readiness - feeling like letting your guard down even for sleep is dangerous - that's exhausting. And I hear how your body has just been a tool for mission survival, not a place where you can actually *be*.\n\nWhat if we started with something smaller than feeling safe in your body? What if we started with being able to close your eyes without feeling like you're betraying your responsibility to protect?",
  "system9": "I don't know how to do that. Every time I close my eyes, it's like I'm back there. Hicks is calling for help, or I'm watching the ground get closer, or... I don't know. It's always something.\n\nBut you're right - I'm tired. I'm so goddamn tired of being on alert every second. Maybe if I could just... I don't know. Maybe if I could just trust that closing my eyes doesn't mean everything falls apart.",
  "user9": "That exhaustion - being on alert every second for years - that's wearing you down to nothing. And trusting that closing your eyes won't make everything fall apart... that's not just about sleep, that's about believing the world won't collapse if you're not watching it every second.\n\nWhat would it take for you to trust that Amanda can hold the watch for a little while? That you don't have to be the only one keeping everything from falling apart?",
  "system10": "I can't ask her to do that. That's not... that's not her job. She's not a soldier, she's not trained for this. I can't put that on her.\n\nBesides, what if I'm asleep and something happens to her? What if she needs me and I'm not there? I already failed Hicks, I already failed... I can't fail her too.",
  "user10": "That weight - feeling like you're the only barrier between the people you love and disaster - that's the same weight that's crushing you. And I hear how Hicks' death sits in your chest like proof that you *do* fail people when they need you most.\n\nBut Amanda's not asking you to put her on watch. She's asking to stop being the thing she needs protection *from*. What if being there for her now means learning to trust that you can close your eyes without everything you love disappearing?",
  "system11": "I don't know how to trust that. Every time I try, I see Hicks' face. I see what happens when you let your guard down, when you think someone else has got it handled.\n\nBut I'm killing everything I love anyway, aren't I? Amanda jumps when I move too fast. The kids walk on eggshells. I'm losing them while I'm wide awake and trying to protect them.",
  "user11": "That realization - that you're destroying what you love while trying to protect it - that's the hardest truth. You're watching yourself become the threat they need protection *from*, and it feels like there's no way out.\n\nBut here's what I'm hearing underneath: you're not just fighting to protect them anymore. You're fighting to protect *yourself* from becoming the thing that hurts them. And that's where we can find a way forward.\n\nWhat if your intentions could help you stop being the threat, without asking you to stop being the protector? What would those intentions need to be?",
  "system12": "I need to stop waking up angry. I need to stop jumping at every sound like it's incoming fire. I need to... I need to figure out how to be in this house without making everyone afraid of me.\n\nMaybe if I could just... I don't know. Maybe if I could trust that being still doesn't mean I'm failing. That letting Amanda sleep without me watching over her doesn't mean I'm abandoning my post.\n\nI need to learn how to protect them *from* me.",
  "user12": "That shift - from protecting them *from* threats to protecting them *from* you - that's where the real work is. And learning that being still isn't failing your post, that letting Amanda sleep without standing guard over her isn't abandonment... that's what needs to change.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding peace in your own body so you can sleep without the rage and jumping\n2. Learning that stillness and trust aren't betrayals of your protective duty\n3. Protecting your family from the war that's living in you\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system13": "Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I can't keep being the thing that scares them. I can't keep... I can't keep letting whatever's still inside me from over there tear up what's left of my life here.\n\nSo what do I do with that? How do I... how do I make those into whatever I'm supposed to carry into this thing?",
  "user13": "Those three truths you just named - they're already becoming your intentions. Let me put words to what you already know:\n\n**Based on what you've shared, here are some intentions that might resonate:**\n\n1. \"I open myself to finding peace in my body so I can sleep without rage and fear\"\n2. \"I embrace learning that stillness and trust aren't betrayals of those I protect\"\n3. \"I seek to release the war inside me so I stop harming what I love most\"\n\n**Which of these speaks most strongly to you?** Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system14": "The third one. That one hits me in the chest - \"I seek to release the war inside me so I stop harming what I love most.\" That's... that's what I need. That's everything right there.\n\nI don't know about the others yet. Still feels like giving up control, and I can't... I can't just hand that over. But maybe if I can get the war out of me, maybe the rest follows. Maybe I can learn to trust after that.",
  "user14": "That third one - it lands because you already know what's at stake. The war inside you is the real enemy now, not whatever's outside your door.\n\n\u2713 **Intention 1 locked in: \"I seek to release the war inside me so I stop harming what I love most\"**\n\nNow let's look at those other two. You said getting the war out might make space for trust to follow. What about something like:\n\n**\"I open myself to discovering that protecting my family includes protecting them from my pain\"** \n\nOr does that still feel like too much control to give up right now?",
  "system15": "That one's better. It's still about protecting - I can hold onto that. It's not about giving up control, it's about... it's about protecting them better. Smarter.\n\nYeah. I can carry that one.",
  "user15": "\u2713 **Intention 2 locked in: \"I open myself to discovering that protecting my family includes protecting them from my pain\"**\n\nNow for the third intention. We've got releasing the war inside you, and learning to protect them from your pain. There's still that piece about finding peace in your body - the sleep without jumping, the stillness without feeling like you're failing your post.\n\nWhat about something like **\"I welcome learning to be still without abandoning those I love\"**?\n\nOr do you need to approach the body peace differently?",
  "system16": "I don't know about being still. Still feels like... like I'm just waiting to get hit. Like I'm letting my guard down.\n\nBut the body peace part - maybe... maybe something about learning to rest without feeling like I'm failing them? I need to sleep. I need to stop waking up ready to fight. I just... I don't know how to say that without the stillness part.",
  "user16": "What about **\"I seek to rest without feeling like I'm failing those I protect\"**?\n\nThat keeps it about protecting - about not failing your duty - but gives you permission to actually sleep. No stillness, no giving up control, just... rest that doesn't feel like betrayal.",
  "system17": "Yeah. Yeah, that I can do. I need to be able to close my eyes without feeling like I'm letting them down. Without feeling like I'm... like I'm leaving my post.\n\n\u2713 **Intention 3: \"I seek to rest without feeling like I'm failing those I protect\"**\n\nThat's the third one. That's what I need to carry in there.",
  "user17": "\u2713 **Intention 3 locked in: \"I seek to rest without feeling like I'm failing those I protect\"**\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card you keep with your wallet or keys\n- Record yourself reading them and listen before sleep\n- Keep them where you see Amanda's photo\n- Create a small ritual with them before bed\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when the old patterns come knocking?",
  "system18": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe... maybe I'll read 'em when I'm brushing my teeth at night. Before I go to bed. Before the nightmares come.",
  "user18": "That fits - keeping them close to something you already carry every day, and reading them when you're facing the hardest part of the day. \n\n**Your 3 intentions for this journey:**\n\n1. \"I seek to release the war inside me so I stop harming what I love most\"\n2. \"I open myself to discovering that protecting my family includes protecting them from my pain\"\n3. \"I seek to rest without feeling like I'm failing those I protect\"\n\n**Your chosen ritual:** Writing them in your wallet, reading them while brushing your teeth before bed.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything - just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nThis takes courage, facing what's been eating you alive for years. Wishing you strength on this journey, brother.",
  "system19": "Thank you. I... I don't know if this is gonna work. But I'm gonna try. I have to try.\n\nThree weeks. Then I find out if this plant stuff can actually help me keep what matters.",
  "user19": "That's all any of us can do - try. You don't have to believe it's going to work perfectly. You just have to show up with these intentions and see what the medicine shows you.\n\nThree weeks. And you're walking in with clear eyes about what you're fighting for - not the war anymore, but your family. That's a different kind of strength.\n\nI'll be holding that intention for you too."
