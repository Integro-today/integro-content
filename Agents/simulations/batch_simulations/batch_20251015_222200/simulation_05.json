  "system0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with my nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up screaming and watching Amanda flinch away from me.",
  "user0": "I hear the exhaustion in your voice - not just from the nightmares, but from watching Amanda flinch away from something you can't control. Coming here takes real courage when you're carrying that kind of pain.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your ayahuasca journey - it points you toward what you need most without forcing a specific outcome. These medicines tend to work better when we give them direction, especially with something as deep-rooted as trauma that shows up in your sleep.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your ceremony:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through some questions to explore what you're hoping to heal or understand about these nightmares and your relationship with Amanda. Together we'll build intentions that feel right for you.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with trauma and nightmares first, including examples from other veterans.\n\nWhich feels better to start with?",
  "system1": "I don't need examples from other people. This is my mess to deal with.\n\nJust... what kind of questions? I already told you what I need - the nightmares to stop, Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm about to explode. I need to be the man she married again.\n\nI guess start with whatever questions you got.",
  "user1": "That's fair - this is your mess, and you know what you need better than anyone else does.\n\nLet me ask you this: When you say you want to be the man she married again - what was different about that version of you? What did you have then that feels lost now?",
  "system2": "That guy... he didn't wake up choking on air. Didn't have to check the locks three times before bed. Didn't need to sit in his truck for twenty minutes before walking into his own house, getting ready to pretend everything's fine.\n\nHe could look Amanda in the eye without seeing her scared. Could hold his kids without feeling like he's contaminating them with whatever's broken inside him.\n\nThat guy knew who he was. Simple. Insurance man, father, husband. Not... whatever this is now.",
  "user2": "I hear that - the way you're describing it, it's like you got fractured into pieces, and you're watching yourself from outside, not recognizing who you've become.\n\nWhat do you think happened over there that started changing all this? Not the details - but what got broken that you're still trying to fix?",
  "system3": "I don't... I can't...\n\nIt's not about what happened over there. It's about what I brought back. The way I learned to shut everything off just to get through it. Worked fine when I needed it to work. \n\nBut now I can't turn it back on. Can't feel anything except this... pressure. Like I'm always about to blow. And when I do sleep, it's all right there waiting.\n\nI just need to learn how to shut it off properly. That's all.",
  "user3": "I hear you - it's like you found a switch to survive, but now it's stuck in the wrong position and you can't figure out how to flip it back.\n\nWhat would \"shutting it off properly\" look like? If you could wave a wand and fix this, how would you know it was working? What would be different about your days, your nights, your time with Amanda?",
  "system4": "I'd sleep through the night. Wake up and not feel like I got hit by a truck. Amanda wouldn't be sleeping on the couch half the time.\n\nI'd come home and not need that drink before I could stand being around my own family. Could sit through dinner without feeling like I need to jump out of my skin. Could touch her without her tensing up, waiting for me to flinch or shout.\n\nMy kids wouldn't ask \"Dad, are you okay?\" like they do now. I'd know how to answer when they ask.\n\nI'd just... be normal again. Not sitting here feeling like I'm about to explode or disappear.",
  "user4": "I can feel how much you miss that normal - the simple peace of just being present with your family without this constant pressure building inside you.\n\nLet me ask you this: When you imagine being able to touch Amanda without her tensing up, what do you want her to feel from you instead of fear? What do you want to be able to give her and your kids that you feel cut off from right now?",
  "system5": "I want her to feel... safe. Like she used to. Like I'm solid ground she can stand on, not some bomb that might go off.\n\nWant my kids to feel like they can just be kids. Not worried about Dad's moods or whether he's gonna wake up screaming again.\n\nWant to be able to look at them and not feel like I'm lying every time I say \"I'm fine.\" Want to actually BE fine for once. Not just saying it.\n\nI want to be the man they think I am when they look at me. The one who's supposed to protect them, not the one they need protection from.",
  "user5": "I hear that deep desire to be solid ground again - to be the protector instead of what they need protecting from.\n\nWhat do you think it would take for you to start feeling like that man again? Not just acting like him, but actually being him from the inside out?",
  "system6": "I don't know. That's the hell of it - I been trying everything I know how to do. Work harder, run more, keep the routine tight. None of it's working.\n\nMaybe... maybe I need to stop trying to muscle through it like everything else. That's what this Heroic Hearts thing is about, right? Some different way?\n\nI hate even saying this, but maybe I need to figure out how to... feel whatever this is instead of just clamping down on it. Though I got no idea how to do that without losing control completely.\n\nThat's what scares me about this whole thing. What if I open up that box and can't get the lid back on?",
  "user6": "That's the real fear, isn't it - that if you stop clamping down, you'll flood everyone you love with what's been building up.\n\nBut you're right - everything you've tried, the muscling through, the tight routines, it's like trying to fix a broken bone by running on it. Maybe this is about learning a different way to hold what's inside you without it exploding or disappearing.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding a way to feel safe in your own body again - sleeping through the night, not waking up choking\n2. Being able to give your family the safety they need from you - Amanda not sleeping on the couch, kids not asking if you're okay\n3. Learning how to feel without losing control - opening that box without everything spilling out\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system7": "Yeah. That's... that's it exactly.\n\nI need to figure out how to be in my own skin again without wanting to crawl out of it. Need to stop being something my family has to work around.\n\nAnd I guess I need to learn whatever the hell this different way is. Even if I don't believe in it yet.",
  "user7": "I hear that - needing to believe in something different even when you're not sure you can.\n\nBased on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to feeling safe and present in my own body again\n2. I reclaim my role as a source of safety and stability for my family\n3. I welcome a new way of holding my pain without it controlling me\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system8": "The second one. That's what matters most - being someone my family can count on again. Not some... liability they have to tiptoe around.\n\nBut I need to change the words. \"Reclaim\" sounds too soft. Like I'm some victim getting something back.\n\nHow about: \"I become the protector my family needs me to be again.\"\n\nThat's what I'm after. Being the wall between them and everything that could hurt them, instead of being the thing they need protection from.",
  "user8": "That's powerful - the shift from \"reclaim\" to \"become\" tells me you see this as taking ownership, not waiting for something to be handed back.\n\nHow does \"I become the protector my family needs me to be again\" feel? Does it capture that sense of being the wall instead of the threat?\n\nWhat about the first intention - being safe in your own body again? How would you want to word that one?",
  "system9": "Yeah, that one feels right. Direct. No soft language about it.\n\nFor the body one... I want to say something like \"I learn to stand in my own skin without wanting to jump out of it.\" But that sounds too dramatic.\n\nHow about: \"I find peace in my own body again.\"\n\nSimple. Direct. That's all I'm after - just being able to sleep without the dreams, wake up without feeling like I need to fight or run.",
  "user9": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I find peace in my own body again\"\n\nI hear what you're after - just being able to exist in your own skin without that constant urge to escape it.\n\nFor the third intention - learning that different way to hold your pain without it controlling you - how do you want to word that? What feels like the right way to say you're open to whatever this new way is, even if you don't know what it looks like yet?",
  "system10": "\"I learn to carry what I've seen without it carrying me.\"\n\nThat work? I don't want to lose it completely - those memories, they're part of who I am. But I need to stop letting them drive the truck.\n\nNeed to figure out how to carry it like a soldier carries gear. Still heavy, still there, but not crushing me.",
  "user10": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I become the protector my family needs me to be again\"\n\n\"I learn to carry what I've seen without it carrying me\" - that captures it perfectly. The weight doesn't disappear, but you learn to shoulder it instead of being crushed by it.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I learn to carry what I've seen without it carrying me\"\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n1. I find peace in my own body again\n2. I become the protector my family needs me to be again  \n3. I learn to carry what I've seen without it carrying me\n\nNow - how do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card you keep with your dog tags or gear\n- Keep them where you keep your phone at night\n- Speak them aloud each morning when you lace up your boots\n- Have Amanda write them in a note you carry\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when the work gets hard?",
  "system11": "Yeah, I'll keep them with my dog tags. Been carrying those for twenty years - seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe I'll speak them when I lace up my running shoes in the morning. That's when I'm usually clearest. Before the day starts trying to pull me in ten directions.\n\nI like that - keeping them where I keep the things that matter. Where I can't forget them.",
  "user11": "That's solid - keeping them with your dog tags where they belong, and speaking them when you're clearest before the chaos starts.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n1. I find peace in my own body again\n2. I become the protector my family needs me to be again  \n3. I learn to carry what I've seen without it carrying me\n\nYour ritual: Keep them with your dog tags, speak them when you lace up your boots each morning\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes up.\n\nThis work takes real courage, especially when you've spent years surviving one way and need to learn another. Wishing you strength on this journey.",
  "system12": "Thanks. \n\nI'll... yeah. I'll keep these close. See what happens when I stop trying to muscle through everything and just... let whatever this is do its work.\n\nAppreciate you helping me get clear on what matters.",
  "user12": "You got this. Sometimes the hardest thing is letting go of the muscle-through approach when that's been the only thing keeping you upright.\n\nThese intentions are solid - they'll give you something to hold onto when the work gets rough. Trust the process, trust yourself, and let the medicine do what it does.\n\nTake care of yourself out there.",
  "system13": "*Paul sits with his intentions, the weight of what's ahead settling in. The familiar weight of his dog tags now carries new meaning - not just who he was, but who he's becoming.*\n\n*Tomorrow he'll lace up his boots, speak these words, and start a different kind of mission.*\n\n*One step at a time.*\n\n*Semper Fi.*",
  "user13": "*Semper Fi, Paul.*\n\nSometimes the hardest battles aren't about taking ground - they're about taking back what was lost, piece by piece.\n\nYour mission has changed, but the warrior's still there. Just learning to fight a different war.\n\nOne step at a time. One morning at a time. One intention at a time.\n\nCarry on.",
  "system14": "*Paul nods once, the familiar words settling into place. The mission has changed, but the commitment remains.*\n\n*Carry on.*",
  "user14": "*Carry on.*",
  "system15": "*Paul stands a little straighter, the weight distributed differently now. Not gone - never gone - but balanced. Shared between the man he's been and the man he's becoming.*\n\n*Carry on.*",
  "user15": "*Carry on.*",
  "system16": "*Paul's fingers brush against his chest where dog tags and intentions rest together. The rhythm of survival finds a new cadence - not just enduring, but transforming.*\n\n*Carry on.*",
  "user16": "*Carry on.*",
  "system17": "*The words echo between them, a bridge spanning what was and what will be. Paul breathes deeper, feeling the shift from soldier to something else entirely - still guarding, still protecting, but learning to protect himself too.*\n\n*Carry on.*",
  "user17": "*Carry on.*",
  "system18": "*Paul's shoulders settle, the constant vigilance softening into something more sustainable. The war isn't over - it never really ends - but the battlefield has changed. Now it's in his mind, in his marriage, in the quiet spaces between breaths.*\n\n*Carry on.*",
  "user18": "*Carry on.*",
  "system19": "*Paul feels the weight settle differently now. Not lighter - never lighter - but distributed across stronger ground. The mission isn't about forgetting or pretending anymore. It's about carrying everything, including the parts that scare him most, and still moving forward.*\n\n*Carry on.*",
  "user19": "*Carry on.*"
