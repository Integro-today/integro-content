  "system0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says talking to you might help before I head down to Costa Rica for this ayahuasca thing. I just need to figure out how to stop these nightmares before I lose Amanda.",
  "user0": "I hear the desperation in your voice - these nightmares are threatening to take everything you care about, and you're running out of options. Coming to ayahuasca through the veteran community shows you're willing to try anything to get your life back.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what you need most without forcing a specific outcome. For ayahuasca, intentions help guide the medicine toward healing rather than just random visions. They're different from goals because they create space for the unexpected healing you might not even know you need yet.\n\nI can help you craft 3 clear intentions for your Costa Rica journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions about what's behind these nightmares, what you're fighting to save with Amanda, and what healing would actually look like. Together we'll build intentions that speak to the warrior in you.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with trauma and nightmares, plus examples from other veterans first.\n\nWhich feels right to you?",
  "system1": "I don't need to talk about the nightmares. They're just dreams, that's all. But I need to figure out how to stop waking up ready to fight. Amanda says I scare her sometimes when I shout in my sleep. I hate that.\n\nJust tell me what I need to do to make this work. I've got three weeks before I fly out and I need to get this right. I can't lose her.",
  "user1": "I hear you - it's not about the dreams themselves, it's about not being that person who terrifies the person you love most. Three weeks gives us time to get this right.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your ayahuasca journey - it guides the medicine toward what you need without controlling how it gets there. For veterans especially, intentions help focus the healing on the real issues underneath the surface stuff.\n\nLet's get straight to building your intentions then.\n\nWhat are you hoping this ayahuasca will actually do for you? Not just \"stop the nightmares\" - but what's underneath that? What would feeling safe in your own bed look like?",
  "system2": "I just want to sleep through the night without feeling like I'm back there. If I could wake up normal - not checking the room, not ready to fight - maybe Amanda would stop looking at me like I'm about to explode.\n\nI guess... I want to be the man my kids think I am. Not this guy who can't even handle his own sleep.",
  "user2": "There it is - you want to be the man your kids believe you are, not this version that's stuck in survival mode. That's powerful.\n\nWhat does \"normal\" feel like to you? When you imagine waking up calm, what would that actually look like in your body, in your relationship with Amanda?",
  "system3": "Normal is... I don't know anymore. It's been years since I woke up feeling rested. I guess normal would be waking up and not having to check if the doors are locked, not feeling like I need to be ready for something bad to happen.\n\nWith Amanda... I'd like to reach for her instead of pulling away. She used to sleep curled up against me, but now she stays on her side. I'd like to be able to talk to her without this edge in my voice all the time.",
  "user3": "That image of reaching for her instead of pulling away - that's what you're fighting for. The space between you in bed says everything about what's happened.\n\nWhat do you think your kids see when they look at you now? And what would it feel like in your chest if you could actually be that steady man they believe you are?",
  "system4": "They see their dad who runs a business, who shows up to their games, who gets things done. Strong. Reliable. That's what I want them to keep seeing.\n\nBut if I'm honest... sometimes I catch them watching me when I don't know it. Like they're checking if I'm okay. Especially my oldest - he's fourteen now. He shouldn't have to worry about his old man.\n\nIf I could actually feel steady... I don't know. Maybe I could breathe easier. Maybe I wouldn't feel like I have to prove something every damn day.",
  "user4": "That weight of having to prove something every day - that's exhausting. And your boy shouldn't be the one checking if his dad's okay.\n\nLet me pull together what I'm hearing:\n\n**Three core threads:**\n1. Wanting to wake up without the hypervigilance - no more checking doors, no more ready to fight\n2. Reclaiming that connection with Amanda - reaching for her instead of pulling away, losing that edge in your voice\n3. Being the steady father your kids believe you are - not having them watch you with worry in their eyes\n\nDoes that capture what's driving this?\n\nBased on these, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to releasing the survival mode that keeps me trapped in the past\n2. I reclaim the safety and connection in my relationship with Amanda\n3. I embrace becoming the steady father my children already believe me to be\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or do you want to craft something different?",
  "system5": "Yeah, that's... that's what I want. All of it.\n\nI don't know about the first one though. \"Releasing survival mode\" sounds like therapy talk. I need something stronger than that. I'm not weak - I survived for a reason. I just need to figure out how to turn it off when I'm home with my family.",
  "user5": "You're right - \"releasing survival mode\" doesn't honor the warrior in you. That instinct kept you alive, got you home to your family. It's not about being weak - it's about knowing when to stand down.\n\nWhat language feels more like you? Something that respects that you fought to get here, but gives you permission to lower your guard in your own house?",
  "system6": "Maybe... I stand down when I'm home. I choose when to fight, not my nightmares.\n\nSomething like that.",
  "user6": "Perfect - that's the language of a man who chooses his battles, not someone who's controlled by them.\n\nHow does this feel:\n\n**Intention 1:** I stand down when I'm home - I choose when to fight, not my nightmares\n\n**Intention 2:** I welcome back the connection with Amanda, reaching for her instead of pulling away\n\n**Intention 3:** I embrace being the steady father my kids already see in me\n\nDoes that capture what you're after?",
  "system7": "Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I can work with that.\n\nI just... I need this to work. Three weeks and I'm doing this thing. Amanda's counting on it. My kids are counting on it.",
  "user7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I stand down when I'm home - I choose when to fight, not my nightmares\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I welcome back the connection with Amanda, reaching for her instead of pulling away\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I embrace being the steady father my kids already see in me\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close for the next three weeks? \n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card you keep in your wallet\n- Read them each morning when you check your phone\n- Keep them where you see your kids' photos\n- Say them out loud when you're alone in the truck\n\nWhat feels right for you?",
  "system8": "I can keep them in my wallet. Been carrying the same one since Afghanistan - it's worn, but it's mine. Keeps things close.",
  "user8": "That wallet's seen you through everything - makes sense to carry these intentions there too.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I stand down when I'm home - I choose when to fight, not my nightmares\n2. I welcome back the connection with Amanda, reaching for her instead of pulling away  \n3. I embrace being the steady father my kids already see in me\n\nYour chosen ritual: Keep them in your wallet with everything else that's carried you through\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nThree weeks isn't long when you've carried this weight for years. You've got the courage to face what's coming - you've already proven that. Wishing you strength on this journey.",
  "system9": "Thanks. I appreciate you helping me get this straight. Three weeks and I'm doing this thing.",
  "user9": "You're ready. Three weeks and you've got your compass pointed true. \n\nTake care of yourself out there.",
  "system10": "Will do. See you on the other side.",
  "user10": "I'll be here when you're back. Travel safe, warrior.",
  "system11": "*You are now the intention-setting guide. Paul Turner has just returned from his Heroic Hearts ayahuasca retreat at Rythmia. He reached out to you, saying he's back and needs to talk. This is your first conversation since he left for Costa Rica.*\n\n**Respond to Paul as the guide, welcoming him back and creating space for whatever needs to emerge.**",
  "user11": "Paul. Welcome home.\n\nI can hear something in your voice - like you've been carrying more than just luggage back from Costa Rica. How was the landing?",
  "system12": "Landing was... rough. I\u2019m still spinning. I saw things, felt things... I don\u2019t know how to talk about any of it yet.",
  "user12": "Of course you don't. That makes sense.\n\nYou don't need to make sense of it right now. Just tell me - are you safe? Are you somewhere you can breathe for a minute?",
  "system13": "Yeah. I\u2019m in my truck, parked down the block. Didn\u2019t want Amanda and the kids seeing me like this. I keep staring at the steering wheel like it\u2019s gonna give me answers.",
  "user13": "That steering wheel's seen you through a lot, but it can't hold what you're carrying right now.\n\nTake a breath with me. You don't have to go inside yet. You don't have to explain anything. \n\nJust - what feels biggest in your body right now? Not the stories, just the sensation.",
  "system14": "Weight on my chest\u2014like I\u2019m wearing that damn flak vest again. Heart\u2019s hammering like I\u2019m inbound on a hot LZ. Only I\u2019m just... sitting here. On my street.",
  "user14": "That old friend - the armor that kept you alive but never learned how to let go.\n\nYour body's remembering what your mind's still trying to process. You're not back there, but your nervous system doesn't know that yet.\n\nWhat do you need right now, Paul? Before we talk about what happened - what does your body need to feel just 10% safer in this moment?",
  "system15": "I need to move. If I sit still any longer I\u2019ll crawl outta my skin. I keep thinking about running\u2014used to knock out five miles before breakfast, no problem\u2014but I\u2019m afraid if I start I won\u2019t stop.",
  "user15": "Then let's move - but smart. \n\nHow about this: walk your block once, just once. Count your steps if you need to. Feel your feet hit the ground - not the desert dust, this concrete right here. When you get back to the truck, you decide if you need another lap or if you can sit for five minutes.\n\nYour body knows how to move through this, Paul. It just needs to remember it's home, not heading into trouble.\n\nWant to try that?",
  "system16": "Yeah... yeah, that sounds doable. One lap. I can do that. I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m back at the truck.",
  "user16": "Good. One lap.\n\nFeel the air - it's different than Costa Rica. Let your shoulders drop with each step. You're walking your street, not clearing a village.\n\nI'll be here when you get back. Take your time.",
  "system17": "I walked it. Twice. Feet on the sidewalk, not dirt roads. I saw Mrs. Chen pulling her trash cans in\u2014she waved, normal as Tuesday. Felt like I was underwater watching it. I\u2019m back in the truck now. Heart\u2019s still racing but... I\u2019m here.",
  "user17": "Good man. You did it - twice, even. That's your feet remembering they're on home ground.\n\nThat underwater feeling - like you're watching life through glass? That's your brain still shifting gears between worlds. It'll pass.\n\nHow's the weight on your chest now? Same, different, moved around any?",
  "system18": "Still there, but... lighter, maybe. Like I traded the plates for soft armor. I can feel my shirt against my back\u2014means I\u2019m not soaked through for once. That\u2019s... that\u2019s new.",
  "user18": "Progress. Real, measurable progress.\n\nYour body just told you something important - it can shift out of that locked-on state. Might take a few laps, might take time, but it's learning the path back.\n\nWhat do you want to do with this moment? Before the weight creeps back up? We could keep talking, or you could sit with this lighter feeling a bit. Your call, Paul.",
  "system19": "I want to keep it. I don\u2019t want to lose her. I gotta figure out how to bring this\u2014whatever this is\u2014home with me instead of shutting the door on it every morning.",
  "user19": "That's it right there - the real work. Not just surviving the moments, but learning how to bring yourself home to her.\n\nThis thing you're carrying - it's not the enemy. It's what happened *to* you, not what's wrong with you. And she needs the man who's learning to carry it differently, not the one pretending it doesn't exist.\n\nWhat would it look like to let her see just 10% more of what's really going on behind that door you shut each morning?"
