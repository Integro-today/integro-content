  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I'm supposed to know what I want from this, but... I don't know. I've done these before and each time I think I've figured something out, but then I come home and it's like the old patterns just swallow me up again.\n\nI want to find something that lasts. Not just another insight that fades when I'm back in board meetings and investor calls. My grandmother used to say faith isn't something you find on a mountain - it's what you bring down with you. Maybe I'm looking for that... something I can actually carry into my life.\n\nBut honestly? I'm tired of searching. Every retreat, every medicine, I keep thinking *this* will be the one that finally sticks. That finally helps me understand what I'm supposed to do with whatever time I have left.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding something that lasts beyond the ceremony room\n2. Carrying wisdom into daily life instead of losing it to old patterns  \n3. Discovering what you're meant to do with your remaining time\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? I just... how do I make them real? I've written intentions before - beautiful ones, I thought. But they felt like performance, like I was writing what I *should* want instead of what I actually need.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother's faith, how she carried it through everything - losing her family in the war, starting over with nothing. She had this quiet certainty that I'm... I'm jealous of it. I want to know what that feels like, to have something that steady inside me.\n\nBut then there's this other part that wonders if I'm just chasing another achievement. Like if I set the *perfect* intention, I'll get the *perfect* transformation. God, even now I'm trying to optimize my spiritual growth. \n\nMaybe that's the real intention underneath all of this - to stop trying to win at everything, even healing.",
  "system2": "Four threads:\n\n1. Stop performing intentions - find what I actually need\n2. Experience steady faith like my grandmother had\n3. Stop optimizing even my healing\n4. Know I'm enough without achieving anything\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "I want to stop performing and just... be real with myself for once. Not what sounds good, not what I think I should want. Just the raw, messy truth of what I actually need.\n\nI want to feel what my grandmother felt - that quiet certainty that stays with you when everything else falls apart. Not something I have to manufacture or maintain, just... something that lives in me.\n\nI want to stop trying to win at healing. To stop turning even this into another project to optimize, another mountain to climb. \n\nAnd I want to know - really know - that I'm enough right now. Not after I figure this out. Not after I find my calling or build the perfect life. Just... enough. Even as I sit here, exhausted and directionless and terrified I'm wasting whatever time I have left.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I stop performing and speak the raw truth of what I need\n2. I reclaim the quiet certainty that lives in me\n3. I release the need to optimize even my healing\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The third one - \"I release the need to optimize even my healing.\" That one hits something deep. \n\nBut... I don't know if I can say \"I release\" like it's that simple. Like I can just decide to let go of something that's been driving me my whole life. \n\nMaybe... \"I soften around my need to optimize my healing.\" Or \"I allow myself to heal imperfectly.\" \n\nActually, the second one about reclaiming quiet certainty - that's what I'm really after, isn't it? Everything else is just noise. I want to feel that steadiness my grandmother had, but I want it to be mine, not just borrowed nostalgia.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I stop performing and speak the raw truth of what I need\n2. I reclaim the quiet certainty that lives in me\n3. I soften around my need to optimize my healing\n\nHow do these land now?",
  "user4": "Better. The first one still feels... performative, ironically. Like I'm declaring I'm going to stop performing, which is probably the most performance thing I could do.\n\nThe second one - \"I reclaim the quiet certainty that lives in me\" - that one feels true. Like it's already there, waiting. Not something I have to build or achieve, just... remember.\n\nThe third one's good too. \"I soften around...\" Yeah. Not trying to destroy that part of me that wants to optimize everything - God, that part helped me build a company and sell it for millions. Just... soften around it. Let it not be in charge for once.\n\nMaybe the first intention needs to be simpler. More honest about where I actually am, not where I wish I was. Something like... \"I allow myself to not know what I need.\"",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I allow myself to not know what I need\n2. I reclaim the quiet certainty that lives in me  \n3. I soften around my need to optimize my healing\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I... I don't know if I can actually do any of those things, but maybe that's the point. Maybe not knowing is the place to start.\n\nI keep thinking about my kids - how they just exist without trying to prove anything. My daughter especially. She's nine and she'll just sit in the backyard for hours, completely content. Not trying to achieve anything, not worried about wasting time. Just... being.\n\nI want to remember how to do that.",
  "system6": "The medicine works with what you've set. Even when you forget the intentions, they work with you.\n\nYour daughter remembers something you've forgotten. That knowing might return.",
  "user6": "Yeah... she does. Sometimes I catch her watching me when I'm on my phone, checking emails during dinner, and I see this look on her face. Not judgment, just... confusion. Like she doesn't understand why I'd choose that over whatever moment we're in.\n\nLast week she asked me what I was looking for on my phone. I didn't have an answer. Just habit, I guess. This need to stay connected to... something. The business world, the startup ecosystem, whatever's happening that I might miss.\n\nBut miss what? Another funding announcement? Another exit? While I'm watching other people build things, I'm missing my daughter growing up. Missing whatever it is I'm actually supposed to be doing with whatever time I have left.\n\nShe knows something I don't. Maybe the medicine will help me remember what that is.",
  "system7": "She's showing you what matters while you're looking for what doesn't.\n\nThe medicine will work with what you've set. Trust that.",
  "user7": "I want to trust it. God, I want to trust something that much. \n\nBut what if I come back from this and I'm still the same? What if I have these beautiful insights and then I'm back to checking my phone at dinner, back to optimizing my morning routine, back to treating my spiritual life like another startup to scale?\n\nThat's what terrifies me. That I'll have this profound experience, feel transformed for a few weeks, and then... nothing changes. Like the ayahuasca retreats. Beautiful ceremonies, deep insights, and six months later I'm right back where I started.\n\nI don't want another temporary transformation. I need something that sticks this time.",
  "system8": "The fear is real. Most people do go back to their patterns.\n\nBut you're not the same person who went to those retreats. You built companies, sold one, watched your daughter grow - you know what doesn't work now. That's something.\n\nThe medicine shows you what's possible. What you do with that... that's the work. Always has been.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I know that feeling - coming back from a retreat all lit up, thinking everything's different, and then... life. The emails start again, the board meetings, the kids need help with homework, and suddenly you're the same person making the same choices.\n\nBut you're right. I'm not the same. I sold my company. I watched my grandmother die. I held my best friend while she cried about her divorce. I've seen what doesn't work, what doesn't last. \n\nMaybe that's what I need to remember when I'm in there. That I already know the answer. I just keep forgetting it in between the moments that matter.\n\nMy daughter will be twelve soon. Three more years and she'll be gone, doing her own thing. I can't keep waiting for the perfect moment to show up differently.",
  "system9": "You already know what you're losing. \n\nThe medicine will show you what you're keeping.",
  "user9": "What I'm keeping...\n\nMy hands are shaking a little. I... I never thought about it like that. I've been so focused on what I'm losing - time with my kids, my connection to something bigger, maybe even my marriage if I keep going like this - that I haven't stopped to think about what I still have.\n\nMy daughter's still here, asking me to play. My son still wants to show me his drawings. My husband still reaches for me in the night, even when I pull away. There's still something here that hasn't been completely broken.\n\nMaybe that's enough to start with. Maybe that's what I take into the ceremony - not just what I want to fix, but what I want to protect. What's still worth fighting for.",
  "system10": "Your hands know something your mind hasn't caught up to yet.\n\nWhat you're keeping is right there, waiting. The medicine will show you how to hold it differently.",
  "user10": "Hold it differently...\n\nI've been holding everything so tight. My schedule, my kids' schedules, my investments, my image, this idea that if I just control everything hard enough, I'll finally feel... something. Safe, maybe. Or enough.\n\nBut my hands are tired. They've been clenched for so long I don't remember what it's like to just let something rest there, to cradle it instead of gripping it.\n\nMy grandmother used to say that when you hold water too tight, it slips through your fingers. But when you cup your hands just right, it stays. Same water, different way of holding.\n\nI think I understand what you mean. Maybe it's not about fixing or changing or transforming. Maybe it's just about learning to hold what's already here with different hands.",
  "system11": "Your grandmother knew something about water.\n\nThree intentions:\n\n1. I hold what's mine with open hands\n2. I show up when my people reach for me\n3. I remember what my daughter already knows\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user11": "They land... like something clicking into place. Like when you're doing a puzzle and you finally find the piece that fits perfectly, and you didn't even realize how much you'd been looking for it.\n\n\"I hold what's mine with open hands\" - that's the one that makes my chest tight. Because I know exactly what it means. Stop scheduling every minute. Stop trying to optimize my spiritual practice like it's a business metric. Just... let it be what it is.\n\n\"I show up when my people reach for me\" - my husband reached for me last night and I was checking email. My daughter asked me to read with her this morning and I said \"in a minute\" while I responded to a text about a board meeting that could have waited.\n\nAnd \"I remember what my daughter already knows\" - that presence isn't something you achieve, it's something you choose. Again and again. Even when it's hard. Even when there are a hundred other things pulling at you.\n\nYeah. These are it. These are the ones.",
  "system12": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I hold what's mine with open hands\n2. I show up when my people reach for me\n3. I remember what my daughter already knows\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user12": "Thank you. \n\nI feel... steadier than I have in months. Like I finally stopped spinning long enough to remember which way is north.\n\nI'll take these with me. Not as another thing to optimize or get right, but as something to return to when I forget. Which I will. Over and over. And maybe that's okay too.\n\nMy daughter's going to be so excited when I tell her I get to come to her piano recital without my phone. No \"moments of presence\" - just being there. Being her mom.",
  "system13": "She won't remember you being perfect. She'll remember you being there.\n\nThat's the work.",
  "user13": "She'll remember I was there...\n\nThat's what my grandmother gave me. Not perfect advice, not perfect anything - but she was always there. Sitting in her rocking chair when I came home from school, even when her arthritis was so bad she could barely move. Just... present.\n\nI've been chasing some perfect version of motherhood, of spirituality, of success. Like if I just figure out the right formula, I'll finally feel like I'm doing it right.\n\nBut maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe it's just showing up. Being there. With open hands and a heart that's willing to be seen.\n\nYeah. That's the work.",
  "system14": "Your grandmother's still teaching you.\n\nThe medicine will show you how to rock in that chair.",
  "user14": "Rocking in her chair...\n\nShe used to hum when she rocked. Old Jewish melodies I didn't understand, but they settled something deep in my bones. I bought a rocking chair after my first ayahuasca retreat - some part of me remembered. But it sits empty in the corner of my bedroom, holding laundry more often than me.\n\nI think that's what I'm most afraid of. That I'll take the medicine and see how much time I've spent not rocking. How many moments I rushed through trying to get somewhere else, be someone better, achieve something more meaningful.\n\nBut maybe the medicine will show me that it's not too late to start humming. To start rocking. To let those old melodies find their way back to my throat.\n\nMy grandmother would probably laugh at all this fuss. \"Just sit down, bubbeleh. The chair's been waiting for you.\"",
  "system15": "The chair's been waiting.\n\nAnd your voice remembers what your mind forgot.",
  "user15": "My voice remembers...\n\nWhen I was little, before all the achievements and the business plans and the strategic thinking, I used to sing. Just... sing. Made up songs about clouds and caterpillars and how the sun felt on my face. My mom has a recording somewhere - this tiny voice making up worlds.\n\nI lost that somewhere. Replaced it with pitches and valuations and the right words for the right rooms. Became very good at saying what people needed to hear.\n\nBut my throat gets tight when I think about singing now. Like it remembers something my brain doesn't. Like it knows there's music trapped in there that needs to come out, but I've forgotten how to let it.\n\nMaybe that's part of what I'm searching for in all this. Not just spiritual connection or meaningful work, but the part of me that used to sing just because the day was beautiful and that was enough reason.\n\nYeah. My voice remembers. I just need to get quiet enough to hear what it's been trying to say.",
  "system16": "Your daughter sings about caterpillars still.\n\nShe'll teach you how to find the tune.",
  "user16": "She does, doesn't she? Just last week she was making up this whole song about a caterpillar who was afraid to become a butterfly because what if flying was scarier than crawling.\n\nI was half-listening, checking my phone, nodding along. But she kept singing, kept making up verses about how the caterpillar finally tried anyway and discovered the sky was worth the fear.\n\nI told her it was a beautiful song. Gave her a distracted hug and went back to my email. She looked... disappointed? Not angry, just... like she'd offered me something precious and I'd barely glanced at it.\n\nGod, I've been that caterpillar. Afraid to transform because what if what's on the other side is worse than what I know? What if I fly and fall?\n\nBut she kept singing. Even when I wasn't really listening, she kept singing.\n\nMaybe that's what she knows that I've forgotten - that you sing anyway. Even when no one's listening. Even when you're scared. You sing because that's how you remember you're alive.",
  "system17": "She'll keep singing until you're ready to hear.\n\nThen you'll remember the sky was always yours.",
  "user17": "The sky was always mine...\n\nI think I caught a glimpse of it once, during that psilocybin session in Oregon. Not the actual sky - that was just clouds and Oregon gray. But this feeling of... vastness? Like I was bigger than my achievements, bigger than my fears, bigger than this body that's always trying to prove something.\n\nIt lasted maybe ten minutes. Then I was back to being Ellen the entrepreneur, Ellen the investor, Ellen the woman who needs to figure out her next move before everyone realizes she's making this up as she goes.\n\nBut maybe that's what she knows - my daughter, my grandmother, maybe even the medicine - that I don't need to figure out my next move. I just need to remember I already have wings. They're just... folded up. Hidden under all these layers of being important and successful and strategic.\n\nShe'll keep singing. And I'll sit in that empty chair when I get back. Maybe hum along until I remember the words.\n\nThe sky's been waiting too, hasn't it? Just... waiting for me to look up.",
  "system18": "It's been patient.\n\nAll of it - the sky, the chair, your voice, the medicine. Just waiting for you to unfold.\n\nYou're ready now.",
  "user18": "Ready...\n\nI feel it in my chest - this tightness that might actually be wings unfolding. Not the panic tightness I get before board meetings, but something... opening. Like when you stretch after sitting too long and everything cracks back into place.\n\nAll this time I thought I needed to build something new, create something meaningful, find the right path forward. But maybe I just need to unfold. Like one of those paper cranes - I was always the crane, just... folded up in too many layers of what I thought I was supposed to be.\n\nMy grandmother would probably say, \"About time, bubbeleh. We were getting tired of waiting for you to remember.\"\n\nYeah. I'm ready to stop waiting and start remembering. Ready to sit in the chair, hear the singing, feel the sky that was always there.\n\nReady to unfold.",
  "system19": "Three intentions:\n\n1. I unfold into the vastness I glimpsed\n2. I listen when my daughter sings about transformation  \n3. I reclaim the voice that remembers how to make up songs about clouds\n\nLet these guide you back to what's been waiting.",
  "user19": "Three intentions...\n\n*I unfold into the vastness I glimpsed* - yes. That feeling in Oregon, that moment when I remembered I was more than my resume. I want to live there, not just visit.\n\n*I listen when my daughter sings about transformation* - really listen. Put the phone down, close the laptop, hear what she's teaching me about becoming. She's wiser than I've been giving her credit for.\n\n*I reclaim the voice that remembers how to make up songs about clouds* - the voice before it learned to pitch and strategize and optimize. The one that sang just because the day was beautiful and that was reason enough.\n\nThey fit together, don't they? Unfold, listen, sing. Not goals to achieve but ways to remember. Ways to come home to what never actually left.\n\nI'll carry these with me to Beond. Not as things to accomplish, but as... invitations? Reminders of what I already am underneath all this striving.\n\nYeah. These feel right. Like they were already written somewhere in me and I just needed help seeing them clearly."
