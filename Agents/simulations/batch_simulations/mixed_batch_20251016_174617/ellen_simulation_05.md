## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_8:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**ellen_persona_3**: I guess I'm... I'm trying to figure out what's next. I built this company, sold it, did everything I was supposed to do. But now what? I keep going to these retreats, having these beautiful experiences, seeing these visions of women from my past - my grandmother especially - and I feel connected to something bigger. Then I come home and it's like... it all fades. 

My kids are growing up so fast, my husband doesn't really get why I need to keep doing these ceremonies, and I sit on these boards investing in companies that I don't even believe in anymore. 

I want to know what I'm actually supposed to be doing with whatever time I have left. Something that matters. Something that would make my grandmother proud. Something that brings all these pieces together - the business mind, the spiritual seeker, the mom, the person who just wants to be of service.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Finding what actually matters beyond external success
2. Living from spiritual connection instead of losing it when you return home  
3. Bringing all your parts together into something meaningful

Let's turn these into intentions.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah, those are exactly right. I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this way of being in the world that was so grounded. She built this beautiful life, helped so many people, and never needed anyone to pat her on the back for it. She just... served. 

I want that. I want to stop chasing the next thing and actually figure out what I'm here to do. But every time I try to sit with it, I get restless. I start thinking about all the things I could be building, investing in, scaling up. It's like I can't help myself.

And you're right - I lose it all when I come home. The clarity, the connection, the sense that there's something bigger guiding me. It just... evaporates. I'll meditate for a few days, maybe journal, then I'm back to checking emails at 5am and scheduling board meetings like that's what really matters.

I need something that sticks. Something that keeps me tethered to what I know is true when I'm out there in those ceremonies.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I live from the grounded wisdom my grandmother showed me
2. I build what serves, not what impresses
3. I stay connected to spirit even when life pulls me back into the noise

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**ellen_persona_3**: The third one - "I stay connected to spirit even when life pulls me back into the noise" - that one hits me in the chest. Because that's exactly what happens. I get pulled back into the noise and I lose it all.

But... can we make it stronger? My grandmother would never have said "spirit" - she would have said God, but that word feels too loaded now. Too many people using it to build empires instead of serving. 

Maybe... "I carry the sacred with me, even when the world tries to drown it out." Or something like that. Because it's not about staying connected to some abstract thing - it's about remembering what I know is true when I'm out there in ceremony. That there's something sacred guiding me, and I need to carry it into board meetings and school pickups and all the ordinary moments.

The second one too - "I build what serves, not what impresses" - that cuts right through all my bullshit. I've been so good at building things that impress. The numbers, the growth, the exits. But serve? I'm not sure I even know what that means anymore.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: I carry the sacred with me, even when the world tries to drown it out

How about intention 2: I build what serves, not what impresses - does that land or want to adjust it?


**ellen_persona_3**: No, that one's good. It's clean, direct - exactly what I need to remember when I'm sitting across from some founder pitching me their "Uber for hamsters" or whatever nonsense they cooked up to get rich quick. 

"I build what serves, not what impresses." Yeah. Every time I've gotten caught up in what impresses - the bigger valuation, the faster growth, the more prestigious investors - it's felt hollow after. But the things that actually serve people... those feel different. Like they matter beyond the exit strategy.

My grandmother built this little community center in her neighborhood. Nothing fancy, just a place where kids could come after school, where old people could gather. It never made any money, never got any press. But thirty years later, it's still there. Still serving. That's what I want to build next, whatever form that takes.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: I build what serves, not what impresses

And intention 1: I live from the grounded wisdom my grandmother showed me - how does that land?


**ellen_persona_3**: It's... close. But "grounded wisdom" feels too soft. My grandmother wasn't soft - she was fierce. She came to this country with nothing, built something real, helped hundreds of people through that community center and her synagogue. She'd look you right in the eye and tell you exactly what she thought.

Maybe... "I live from the fierce clarity my grandmother showed me." Or "I carry forward my grandmother's fierce love in action." Because that's what it was - it wasn't about being grounded or wise in some abstract way. It was about looking at what needs doing and doing it. No excuses, no waiting for perfect conditions, no getting distracted by what impresses people.

She would have hated all this navel-gazing I'm doing. "Ellen," she'd say, "stop thinking so much and go help somebody." That's what I need to remember when I'm spiraling in my head about purpose and calling and all that. Just... go help somebody.


**intentions_workflow_8**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: I carry forward my grandmother's fierce love in action

Your 3 intentions:
1. I carry forward my grandmother's fierce love in action
2. I build what serves, not what impresses
3. I carry the sacred with me, even when the world tries to drown it out

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thank you. These feel... right. Like they're actually mine, not something I think I should want. 

I'll carry them with me. When I'm sitting in that ceremony, when I come back home to the kids and the chaos and the emails, when I'm trying to figure out what to build next. 

Fierce love in action. Build what serves. Carry the sacred. 

Yeah. I can hold onto these.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Solid compass.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah. It is.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Trust what comes.


**ellen_persona_3**: I'll try. That's the hardest part for me - not trying to control what happens next, not needing to know how it all turns out. 

But that's what the medicine keeps teaching me, right? That I don't need to have all the answers. Just need to stay open and keep showing up.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Exactly.
