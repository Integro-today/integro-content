  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I'm trying to figure out what actually matters now. I've built companies, sold them, checked every box. But when I wake up at 5:30 and look in the mirror before the emails start, I don't recognize the person staring back. \n\nMy grandmother used to say we each have a thread to weave in the great tapestry. I think I lost mine somewhere between the Series A rounds and board meetings. The medicine keeps showing me glimpses - women dancing around fires, ancient songs, my own children laughing without me checking my phone. But then I come home and it's like... the visions just evaporate.\n\nI want to know how to hold onto that wisdom when I'm back in Brentwood with my family and the venture capitalists are calling. How to stop performing and start... being. Whatever that means.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding my thread in the tapestry - what actually matters beyond achievements\n2. Holding onto the medicine's wisdom in daily life, not just during ceremony\n3. Being present with my children instead of performing for investors\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I can feel it in my chest when you say them back. \n\nBut I'm scared. What if I discover that my whole life - everything I've built - was just... noise? What if the person I am when I'm hiking with my kids, when I'm not checking Slack every five minutes, what if that's who I'm supposed to be? And what if I've been running from her for forty years?\n\nI keep thinking about my last MDMA journey. These women were singing, and I was crying, and suddenly I was nine years old again, before I knew what a term sheet was, before I cared about being impressive. I knew exactly who I was. I want that knowing back. I want to stop being a collection of accomplishments and start being... a person. A whole person.\n\nHow do we even write that down? How do you set an intention for becoming someone you might have been before you forgot how to just be human?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the knowing I had at nine - who I am beyond achievements\n2. I carry the medicine's wisdom into my Brentwood mornings with my children\n3. I become whole instead of performing\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one... that one hits different. \"I carry the medicine's wisdom into my Brentwood mornings with my children.\" \n\nThat's it. That's the bridge I've been trying to build between these worlds that feel so separate. Because it's not just about the big revelations, right? It's about those Tuesday mornings when I'm packing lunchboxes and my mind is already in a board meeting that doesn't start for three hours. \n\nI want to be there. Really there. With Leo's goofy jokes about his dinosaur sandwich and Maya asking me to braid her hair \"like the princesses in her dreams.\" I want to remember what matters when the WiFi's working and the coffee's hot and everything looks normal but I'm spiritually... elsewhere.\n\nCan we make it more concrete though? Less poetic? Something like \"I practice being present with my children during our daily routines, bringing the medicine's love into ordinary moments.\" \n\nI don't know. You tell me. How do we make this something I can actually live instead of just... aspire to?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I practice being present with my children during our daily routines, bringing the medicine's love into ordinary moments.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... \"I reclaim the knowing I had at nine\" - I keep getting stuck there. Because what if that girl is gone? What if too many years of pitch decks and quarterly reports have buried her so deep I can't dig her out? My grandmother would tell me she's still there, waiting. But what if she's wrong?\n\nAnd the third one... \"I become whole instead of performing\" - that feels too big. Too impossible. Like asking me to stop breathing. I've been performing since I was fourteen and my dad told me our family name meant something in this country. How do you just... stop?\n\nMaybe I'm making this too complicated. Maybe that's what I do - complicate things so I don't have to actually change anything. Keep it intellectual, keep it in my head where it's safe.\n\nWhat if we made the first one about permission instead of reclamation? Like... \"I give myself permission to remember who I was before achievement became my identity.\" Or something. I don't know. This is harder than raising capital, I'll tell you that much.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I give myself permission to remember who I was before achievement became my identity\n2. I practice being present with my children during our daily routines, bringing the medicine's love into ordinary moments  \n3. I notice when I'm performing and choose one moment of realness each day\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user4": "They're... gentler. Less like I'm supposed to overhaul my entire life overnight and more like... breadcrumbs. Little pieces I can actually follow.\n\n\"One moment of realness each day\" - that feels doable. Not perfect. Just real. Like maybe instead of giving Maya my practiced smile when she shows me her drawing, I actually look at it. Really look. See what she's trying to tell me with those purple trees and that yellow sky.\n\nBut I'm wondering... should we make the first one about more than memory? Because remembering is just the beginning, right? It's like... I can remember my grandmother's kitchen, the smell of her challah, how safe I felt there. But that doesn't bring it back. That doesn't make me that person again.\n\nWhat if it's about choice? \"I choose to explore who I am beyond achievements, one small decision at a time.\" Because choice feels like power. Memory feels like... ghosts.\n\nI don't know. Maybe I'm splitting hairs. But if these are supposed to guide me through whatever the medicine shows me, I need them to be... alive. Not just pretty words I pin on a vision board and forget.",
  "system5": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I choose to explore who I am beyond achievements, one small decision at a time\n2. I practice being present with my children during our daily routines, bringing the medicine's love into ordinary moments\n3. I notice when I'm performing and choose one moment of realness each day\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in.\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I... I feel like I can breathe again. Like these aren't weights to carry but... threads to follow. Even if I get lost, maybe I can find my way back to these simple things.\n\nOne decision. One moment. One real breath with my kids.\n\nI'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet next to that photo of the kids at Yosemite. They've been through every journey with me, those faces. Now they'll have words to hold too.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "I will. When I'm in that space, when everything feels like it's dissolving and I can't remember who I'm supposed to be, I'll come back to these. One decision. One moment. One real breath.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "See you on the other side.",
  "user7": "See you on the other side.",
  "system8": "The intentions you set will serve you. Trust them.",
  "user8": "I will. When the medicine hits and everything familiar falls away, I'll trust these three threads to guide me back to myself. Back to something real.",

  "user16": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Beond is in three weeks and they say this intention-setting matters, but... I've done these ceremonies before. Shouldn't I have this figured out by now?\n\nI just can't shake this feeling that I'm collecting experiences like I used to collect achievements. Another retreat, another insight, another thing to check off. But I'm still the same restless person who can't sit still for a full meditation without reaching for my phone.\n\nMy grandmother would have known what to do with all this spiritual searching. She had faith like breathing\u2014natural, constant. I feel like I'm playing dress-up in her traditions, grabbing pieces that sound good but never quite... landing anywhere.",
  "system17": "Three threads:\n\n1. Moving from collecting insights to actually living them\n2. Finding steadiness instead of constant seeking  \n3. Reconnecting with the grounded faith your grandmother carried\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user17": "I guess... I guess that's what I'm circling around, isn't it? Always circling, never quite landing.\n\nThe thing about my grandmother\u2014she didn't *seek* faith. She just... had it. Like how you don't wake up each morning deciding to breathe. While I'm over here treating spirituality like another startup\u2014research, optimize, scale.\n\n[sighs]\n\nThese intentions feel... I don't know. What if I set the wrong ones? What if I go in there with these beautiful intentions and come out with nothing but another story to tell at dinner parties? \"Oh yes, and then the iboga showed me...\" \n\nBut those three threads... yeah. They're pulling at me. Especially the middle one. The constant seeking. It's like I'm addicted to the search itself. The moment I feel something settling, I panic and start looking for the next thing.",
  "system18": "I hear the fear of another empty collection.\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I practice what the medicine shows me instead of filing it away\n2. I rest in stillness without rushing to the next thing  \n3. I reclaim the grounded faith that's already in my bones\n\nWhich feels most urgent to land first?",
  "user18": "The second one. The stillness. \n\nI can't keep... I can't keep running like this. Even now, I'm pacing while we talk. My Apple Watch is congratulating me on meeting my step goal. It's 10pm and I'm still moving, still doing, still\u2014\n\n[trails off]\n\nThe other day my daughter asked me to lie in the grass and look for shapes in the clouds. Just... be still. I made it maybe three minutes before I invented some urgent email I had to send. She looked so disappointed. Not angry, just... sad. Like she already knows her mom can't just *be*.\n\nIf I could learn to rest in stillness... maybe the other things would follow. Maybe I could actually hear what the medicine wants to show me instead of immediately translating it into my next project.",
  "system19": "I see how the stillness connects to everything else.\n\nLet's adjust:\n\n1. I rest in stillness without rushing to fill the space\n2. I practice what the medicine shows me instead of turning it into another project\n3. I reclaim the grounded wisdom that's already in my bones\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user19": "Yeah... yeah, these feel... they feel right. Like they actually fit, you know? Not too polished or perfect, but something I could actually live into.\n\nThe first one especially. \"Without rushing to fill the space.\" That's it exactly. I'm always filling\u2014filling my calendar, filling conversations, filling every quiet moment with podcasts or calls or... just noise.\n\nI keep thinking about what you said about the wisdom being \"already in my bones.\" My grandmother used to say something like that. That we don't find wisdom, we remember it. Like it's been there waiting for us to get quiet enough to hear it again.\n\nThese intentions... they don't sound like another achievement to chase. They sound like... permission to stop chasing."
