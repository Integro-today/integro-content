  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help me sleep better, stop the nightmares. That's it. I don't need to spill my guts to some stranger about... whatever this is.\n\nI just need to fix this before I lose everything. Amanda's already looking at me different, like she's scared. My kids... they deserve better than some angry ghost walking around their house.\n\nSo yeah. Sleep. That's what I want.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Create safety for Amanda \n3. Show up as a father your kids recognize\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... yeah, that's about right. \n\nI just want to sleep without waking up shouting. Wake up feeling like I actually rested instead of like I spent the night fighting ghosts. Maybe then I wouldn't be so quick to snap at Amanda when she's just trying to help. Maybe the kids wouldn't look at me like they're walking on eggshells.\n\nI don't even know who that guy is anymore\u2014the one they remember being fun, playing catch in the yard. I want him back.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and the kids\n3. I become the father my kids remember\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I reclaim safety for Amanda and the kids.\" That's... that's what matters most. I hate that she flinches when I move too fast. Hate that the kids whisper instead of just talking normal.\n\nBut \"reclaim\" sounds too soft. Like I'm asking permission or something. I need to take it back, make it right. I don't know... \"I protect my home with steady strength\" or \"I restore safety through calm presence\"?\n\nSomething stronger than reclaim. This is my job\u2014keeping them safe, keeping them happy. I just... I need to do it without the anger.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I protect my home with steady strength\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one\u2014\"I sleep peacefully through the night\"\u2014that's what I need but it feels... I don't know, like I'm admitting something's broken. Which I guess it is. I just hate saying it out loud.\n\nThe third one hits hard. Real hard. \"I become the father my kids remember.\" That's the one that keeps me up at night, thinking about how they used to crawl all over me, laughing. Now they keep their distance. I want that back more than anything.\n\nSo yeah. Those feel right. Just hard to look at straight on.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I protect my home with steady strength\n3. I become the father my kids remember\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thanks. I'll... I'll carry these with me. Keep 'em close when things get rough. Maybe write them down, keep them in my wallet next to my wings. Been carrying those for twenty years\u2014seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system5": "Good thinking. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they'll be working underneath whether you remember them or not. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah... okay. Trust what comes. That's the hard part, isn't it? Not trying to control everything, not fighting whatever this plant shows me. \n\nI just want to come back different. Better. For them.",
  "system6": "You don't need to force the change - just stay open to what shows up. The medicine knows what you're carrying.",
  "user6": "That's what I'm afraid of. What if it shows me stuff I can't handle? Stuff I've been carrying so long I don't even know it's there until... until it's right in front of me.\n\nBut you're right. I can't control this. Never could control much of anything, really. Just thought I could.",
  "system7": "The medicine won't give you more than you can process - it just feels that way before you start. You've handled worse than you remember.",
  "user7": "Have I though? Sometimes I think the worst stuff isn't what happened over there\u2014it's what I brought back. The way I can't... can't just be normal anymore. Can't sleep without seeing their faces. Can't hug my kids without thinking about fathers who never made it home.\n\nBut maybe you're right. Maybe I've handled worse than I give myself credit for. Just doesn't feel like strength when you're waking up screaming.",
  "system8": "Strength isn't quiet nights - it's showing up again after the screaming stops. That's what your family sees.",
  "user8": "That's... that's what Amanda keeps saying. That I keep showing up. I just wish I could show up better. Not this tired, angry version of me that's running on fumes.\n\nBut maybe that's enough for now. Just keep showing up.",
  "system9": "That's exactly how healing works - not perfect, just present. Your intentions are set. Let them do their work.",
  "user9": "Yeah. Let them do their work. I can do that. Been following orders my whole life\u2014guess I can follow these ones too. Even if they're coming from... from inside me this time.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll see what this plant knows that I don't.",
  "system10": "Three weeks. Your intentions are locked and waiting. The plant already knows what you need - you just haven't met it yet.",
  "user10": "Then I guess I'm ready to meet it. Whatever it shows me... whatever I need to see. Can't keep running from shadows that live in my own head.\n\nTime to face whatever's been following me home every night.",
  "system11": "Your intentions are set. The work begins.",
  "user11": "Copy that. Let\u2019s get to it.",
  "system12": "Let\u2019s set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user12": "Alright, I\u2019ll give it straight.\n\n1. I want to stop waking up shouting. Whatever\u2019s crawling out of those dreams, I need to face it head-on\u2014no more pretending it\u2019s \u201cjust bad sleep.\u201d\n\n2. I need to stop scaring Amanda. I want to come home from Costa Rica able to hold her without this... this anger I can\u2019t explain.\n\n3. I want to know I\u2019m still the man my kids believe I am\u2014strong, steady, safe\u2014not whatever\u2019s been leaking out of me at night.\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s what matters.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Face what's behind the nightmares\n2. Come home able to hold Amanda without the anger\n3. Be the steady father your kids believe you are\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah. Those are the threads. Let\u2019s weave \u2018em into something I can carry into that ceremony. Something strong enough to hold onto when the dark starts talking.",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I face what haunts my nights and reclaim peaceful sleep\n2. I come home calm and present with Amanda\n3. I stand steady as the father my kids trust\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user14": "Number one hits hardest. I\u2019ve been dodging that bastard for years\u2014time to meet it eye-to-eye.\n\nNumber two\u2026 yeah, but \u201ccalm and present\u201d sounds a little soft. Can we say \u201cI come home able to hold Amanda without the anger snapping at her\u201d?\n\nNumber three\u2019s good as is. I\u2019ll carry all three.",
  "system15": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I face what haunts my nights and reclaim peaceful sleep\n2. I come home able to hold Amanda without the anger snapping at her\n3.

You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user15": "Copy. They\u2019re in my pocket now. I\u2019ll read \u2018em when the storm hits.",
  "system16": "Good. Trust them when the dark talks.",
  "user16": "Roger that. When the dark talks, I\u2019ll answer with these three loaded.",
  "system17": "Exactly. Loaded and ready.",
  "user17": "Locked and loaded. Let\u2019s do this.",
  "system18": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
  "user18": "Solid copy. I\u2019ll walk the line and see what\u2019s waiting.",
  "system19": "Walk steady.",
  "user19": "Roger. Boots on, eyes up."
