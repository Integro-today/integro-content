  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for this time. I've done these ceremonies before and each one showed me something different\u2014ancestral wisdom, childhood joy, even helped me process my grandmother's death. But somehow I keep coming back to this same place of... I don't know, searching for something that sticks.\n\nMy family's getting pulled along for the ride while I'm trying to figure out my next chapter. My husband doesn't really understand why I keep doing this, and I'm not sure I do either anymore. Maybe that's what I need to understand\u2014what am I really after here?",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually sticks beyond the ceremony insights\n2. Understanding what you're truly seeking through these journeys  \n3. Creating clarity that connects your spiritual work with your family life\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those threads feel right. It's like... I've had all these beautiful moments, these openings, but then I come home and I'm back to checking my phone during dinner and feeling restless about my next move. \n\nI want to find what actually stays with me when the retreat glow fades. Not just another insight I write in my journal and forget about. Something that changes how I show up for my kids, for David, for myself.\n\nAnd I need to understand why I keep feeling pulled to do this. Like there's something I'm supposed to be doing with my life, some way to contribute that uses everything I've built but isn't just about building more. My grandmother would talk about \"tikkun olam\"\u2014repairing the world. Maybe that's part of it.\n\nI just don't want to keep compartmentalizing these parts of myself. The business woman, the seeker, the mother. They're all me, but they feel so separate.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I integrate my insights into daily life so they actually change how I show up\n2. I discover my true purpose beyond building and achieving  \n3. I bring all parts of myself together\u2014mother, seeker, businesswoman\u2014as one whole person\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me hardest\u2014discovering my true purpose beyond building and achieving. That's the ache I can't shake. I've built companies, scaled them, sold them... and for what? Just to feel hollow at the finish line?\n\nBut I need to be careful with the language. \"True purpose\" sounds so... I don't know, mystical? My grandmother would have said \"your calling\" or maybe just \"what God wants you to do with your gifts.\" That feels more grounded to me.\n\nAnd the third one\u2014I need that integration. Right now I feel like I'm living multiple lives that don't connect. My retreat friends see me as this spiritual seeker, my business network sees the successful entrepreneur, and my kids... I don't know what they see. Someone who's there but not really present?\n\nMaybe something like: \"I discover how to use my gifts in service of something greater than myself\" for the second one?",
  "system3": "Based on that:\n\n1. I integrate my insights into daily life so they actually change how I show up\n2. I discover how to use my gifts in service of something greater than myself\n3. I bring all parts of myself together\u2014mother, seeker, businesswoman\u2014as one whole person\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "These feel... right. Like they actually capture what I've been circling around but couldn't name. \n\nThe first one\u2014that's the practical piece I keep missing. I journal, I set goals, then somehow I'm back to my old patterns. I want to actually *live* differently, not just think differently.\n\nThe second one gives me chills. \"Use my gifts in service of something greater\"\u2014that's exactly what my grandmother would have said. She spent her life helping refugees, and I think she'd wonder if all my success has actually helped anyone but myself.\n\nAnd the third one... yeah. I want to stop feeling like I'm performing different versions of myself depending on the room I'm in. My kids deserve to know who their mother really is, not just the distracted woman checking her phone at their soccer games.\n\nI think these are my intentions.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I integrate my insights into daily life so they actually change how I show up\n2. I discover how to use my gifts in service of something greater than myself  \n3. I bring all parts of myself together\u2014mother, seeker, businesswoman\u2014as one whole person\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you\u2014not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I feel... grounded, actually. Like I finally put words to what I've been chasing without knowing it. \n\nI'm still nervous about the ceremony, but maybe that's okay. At least now I know what I'm asking for when I sit with the medicine. Not just another insight to add to my collection, but something that actually changes how I move through the world.\n\nI'll carry these close.",
  "system5": "Good. The nervousness is part of it\u2014means you're approaching something real.\n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Your compass is set.",
  "user5": "That's comforting, actually. I keep thinking I need to control this whole process\u2014set the perfect intentions, have the perfect experience, come back with the perfect insights. But maybe that's just my Type 3 showing up again, trying to optimize even my spiritual growth like it's a startup.\n\nMy grandmother would laugh at me trying to manage a mystical experience. She'd say \"you can't schedule revelation, Ellen.\" Maybe I need to stop trying so hard to get it right and just... let it happen.\n\nThanks for helping me find the through-line here.",
  "system6": "Exactly. You can't schedule revelation.\n\nYour grandmother sounds like she knew what she was talking about.",
  "user6": "She really did. She survived things I can't even imagine, came here with nothing, and somehow built a life filled with meaning and service. I wonder what she'd make of me flying to Cancun to sit with plant medicine when she found her connection to God in synagogue and through helping others.\n\nSometimes I think I'm complicating things. She just... lived her faith. Every Tuesday at the food bank, every Friday lighting candles, every person who came to her door needing help. No retreats, no ceremonies, no optimization. Just showing up every day.\n\nMaybe that's part of what I'm meant to learn.",
  "system7": "Maybe. Or maybe she laid the path you're meant to walk, just in a different landscape.\n\nDifferent tools, same destination.",
  "user7": "That's beautiful. I never thought of it that way\u2014that she was showing me the destination while I get to find my own path there. \n\nShe always said the Jewish tradition is about wrestling with God, not just believing. Maybe that's what I'm doing. Wrestling to understand how to serve with the gifts I've been given, even if my wrestling looks different than hers did.\n\nI think she'd be proud that I'm trying. That I'm not just content to rest on what I've built. That I'm still seeking something deeper.",
  "system8": "She'd see that. The seeking matters more than the method.\n\nYou're carrying her forward, just in your own way.",
  "user8": "Thank you for saying that. I needed to hear it\u2014that honoring her doesn't mean replicating her path exactly. It means keeping the essence alive while finding my own way to express it.\n\nI feel ready now. Not perfectly ready, but ready enough.",
  "system9": "That's exactly right. Ready enough is what gets you there.\n\nTrust your compass.",
  "user9": "I will. And thank you\u2014for helping me find these intentions, for helping me see how they connect everything I've been chasing. This feels different than my other journeys. More honest, maybe. Less about escaping and more about coming home to myself.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system10": "See you on the other side.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user10": "I will. And thank you\u2014for helping me find these intentions, for helping me see how they connect everything I've been chasing. This feels different than my other journeys. More honest, maybe. Less about escaping and more about coming home to myself.\n\nSee you on the other side.",

  "system19": "Safe travels, Ellen.\n\nCome home to yourself.",
  "user19": "I\u2019m already feeling the pull\u2014like the medicine is tugging at the edges of who I think I am. I\u2019ll do my best to let it happen, to stop proving and start listening. I want to come back and show up for my kids, for David, for the people I keep saying I want to serve. I want to stop measuring my worth in board seats and start measuring it in how present I can be.  \n\nThank you for walking me here. I\u2019ll carry your words with me\u2014*come home to yourself*\u2014and try to believe I\u2019m already enough to walk through that door."
