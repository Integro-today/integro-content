  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I need to figure out what I'm actually doing with my life now. After selling the company, everyone expects me to either start another unicorn or just... retire gracefully. But neither feels right.\n\nI keep chasing these retreats\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA with the women's group\u2014thinking the next one will finally give me the answer. Now I'm heading to Beond for ibogaine this winter, and honestly? I'm scared it's just going to be another beautiful experience that fades when I'm back home, checking emails at 5:30am while my kids eat breakfast without me.\n\nMaybe I need to stop looking for a destination and figure out how to just... be present. In my actual life. With David and the kids. But I don't even know what that means anymore.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what matters beyond the next achievement\n2. Being present with David and your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n3. Living what you discover instead of collecting beautiful experiences that fade\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? I keep thinking if I just find the right medicine, the right retreat, the right spiritual practice, it'll all click into place. But maybe that's just another form of achievement-chasing.\n\nI want to be done with that pattern. I want to... I don't know how to say this without sounding like a self-help book, but I want to feel like I'm living my actual life, not just performing it really well.\n\nWhen I'm at the park with the kids, watching them climb the monkey bars, there's this moment where I feel like myself. Not Ellen the entrepreneur, not Ellen the board member, not even Ellen the spiritual seeker. Just... me. I want more of that. But I don't know how to make it last when the emails start piling up and the board meetings start and everyone's asking \"what's next?\"\n\nHow do you even set an intention for something that basic?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live my actual life, not just perform it\n2. I show up present for monkey bar moments with my kids\n3. I stay grounded in who I am beyond achievements\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest\u2014I live my actual life, not just perform it. That's... yeah. That's what I need. Though \"perform\" feels a little soft. I've been *performing* my whole life, and I'm damn good at it. Too good.\n\nThe monkey bar moments one feels real too. It's not just being present with the kids\u2014it's recognizing those glimpses of myself when I'm not trying to be anything. But maybe we could make it stronger? Less... precious?\n\nI don't know about the third one. \"Who I am beyond achievements\" sounds like something I'd put on a vision board. I need something more concrete. Something that stops me from automatically reaching for the next thing before I've even processed what I just did.\n\nCan we make these tougher? More like... rules I can't weasel out of?",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I stop performing and start living my actual life\n2. I recognize myself in monkey bar moments without rushing past them\n3. I pause before reaching for the next thing and feel what just happened\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "The first one\u2014*I stop performing and start living my actual life*\u2014that one makes my chest tight. In a good way. Like someone's calling me out on my own bullshit.\n\nThe second one... I don't know. \"Monkey bar moments\" feels too cute now that I see it written down. When I'm watching my daughter climb, there's this split second where I forget to check my phone, forget about whatever deal I'm working on, forget about being Ellen Who Has It All Together. I just... exist. But I don't want to turn it into some precious mindfulness thing. It's messier than that.\n\nThe third one might be the most important. I literally cannot remember the last time I paused after finishing something before jumping to the next thing. Sold my company, took maybe a week before I was on three new boards and mentoring five startups. Even with these retreats\u2014I'm barely home before I'm planning the next one.\n\nWhat if we made the second one more direct? Less Instagram-quote?",
  "system4": "Let's make it tougher:\n\n1. I stop performing and start living my actual life\n2. I exist without reaching for my phone or the next thing\n3. I pause after finishing before jumping to what's next\n\nMore direct?",
  "user4": "Yes. These feel like actual rules I might be able to follow. Like... if I break them, I'll know. No hiding from these.\n\nThe second one especially - *I exist without reaching for my phone or the next thing.* That hits where I live. I don't even notice myself doing it anymore. Standing at the park, phone in hand, checking deals while my kids are right there asking me to watch them climb. Or worse\u2014mentally drafting emails while I'm supposed to be watching a movie with David.\n\nThe third one too. I need that pause. That actual space between things. Right now my life is just one long run-on sentence with no punctuation.\n\nThese three... I can carry these into the ibogaine. They're simple enough to remember when everything gets weird and intense, but real enough to matter.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I stop performing and start living my actual life\n2. I exist without reaching for my phone or the next thing  \n3. I pause after finishing before jumping to what's next\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. These feel... solid. Like I can't talk my way around them or turn them into another achievement to check off.\n\nI'm scared about the ibogaine. Not the medicine itself\u2014I trust the team at Beond. But what if I come back and these intentions just... fade like all the others? What if I can't hold onto them when the real world starts demanding things again?\n\nI guess that's why we write them down. So when I'm back home, checking my phone at 5:30am, maybe I'll remember there was something else I was supposed to be doing. Something about actually living instead of just... performing.\n\nI want to believe these will stick. I really do.",
  "system6": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. These three have already changed how you see things - that doesn't un-happen.\n\nTrust what you've set. You're ready.",
  "user6": "I needed to hear that. The way you said it\u2014*that doesn't un-happen.* Like even if I mess this up completely, something still shifts. Maybe that's enough.\n\nI've been carrying this fear that I need to get it perfect this time. Like if I don't come back with some profound transformation, I've failed. But maybe... maybe just showing up with these three simple things is enough work for one journey.\n\nThank you. For making this feel possible instead of impossible.",
  "system7": "You showed up. That was the work.\n\nTrust what comes next.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I did show up, didn't I? Even when every part of me wanted to intellectualize my way out of this conversation, keep it surface-level, pretend I have it all figured out.\n\nI didn't. I stayed. That's... new.\n\nOkay. I'm ready.",
  "system8": "Good.",
  "user8": "Okay.",
  "system9": "You are.",
  "user9": "I am.",
  "system10": "*ends*",
  "user10": "Thank you. For everything.",
  "system11": "You're welcome.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m carrying this with me\u2014into the medicine, into my life. You helped me see that I don\u2019t have to prove anything; I just have to keep showing up.",
  "system12": "That's it. Keep showing up.",
  "user12": "I will. I\u2019ll keep showing up\u2014even when it\u2019s messy, even when I want to hide behind achievements or slide back into old patterns. I\u2019m done running from myself.",
  "system13": "That's the work.",
  "user13": "Yeah. I used to think the work was the next deal, the next board seat, the next headline. Turns out it\u2019s just... this. Sitting with myself when there\u2019s no applause.",
  "system14": "The quiet is where the real stuff happens.",
  "user14": "I used to fill every quiet moment with emails or podcasts or planning the next win. Now I\u2019m learning to let the silence speak\u2014though sometimes it still scares the hell out of me.",
  "system15": "Scared is fine. Stay anyway.",
  "user15": "I\u2019m staying. Even when my chest gets tight and the old voice whispers that I\u2019m wasting time, I\u2019m staying. I owe it to my kids, to my grandmother\u2019s memory, to the woman I\u2019m becoming.",
  "system16": "That's your compass now.",
  "user16": "Then I\u2019ll follow it\u2014through the fear, through the restlessness, through whatever the iboga shows me. Staying feels like the first honest commitment I\u2019ve made in years.",
  "system17": "Honest commitment holds. Trust it through whatever comes.",
  "user17": "I\u2019m trying. Some mornings I still wake up reaching for the old scorecard\u2014then I remember it\u2019s gone and my stomach drops. But I keep my feet on the floor, breathe through the free-fall, and remind myself this is the new metric: am I true right now, not am I winning.",
  "system18": "That's the measure that matters now.",
  "user18": "Then that\u2019s the one I\u2019ll use\u2014no quarterly reports, no valuation slides, just this simple, terrifying question each breath: am I real or am I performing?",

  "user19": "I want to stop hustling for worth and finally believe I\u2019m enough without another win.  \nI want to hear what my grandmother\u2019s faith was whispering before I traded mystery for metrics.  \nI want to come home to my kids and husband as a whole woman, not a schedule with a smile."
