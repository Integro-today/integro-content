  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Alright, what's today's lesson supposed to be about?",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nHow are you arriving today?",
  "system1": "Tired. Had another bad night.",
  "user1": "Got it. Tired nights make everything heavier.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Four reflection questions first. Then I'll weave in the teaching as we go.\n\nOption B: I share the teaching content first. Then you reflect on what landed.\n\nEither way, we'll create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "system2": "Option B. Just tell me what Im supposed to know.",
  "user2": "I'll share today's teaching. We can pause whenever you need.\n\nMost people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system3": "I guess. But I dont feel broken, just... tired.",
  "user3": "That makes sense. Tired isn't broken - it's information.\n\nMany traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.\n\nNot about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.\n\nThat resonate?",
  "system4": "idk man. My relationship to pain is I want it to stop keeping Amanda awake.",
  "user4": "That's real. Pain that steals sleep isn't abstract - it's exhausting.\n\nThe fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair. Creates shame: \"Why am I not healed yet?\"\n\nBut if healing is wholeness, even this tired moment counts. Even the struggle to sleep.\n\nNotice that pattern in yourself?",
  "system5": "Yeah. Every morning I wake up thinking \"why am I still like this?\" Like Im supposed to be fixed already.",
  "user5": "That's the trap. \"Why am I still like this?\" positions you as a failed project.\n\nIn psychedelic work this matters. If you go expecting the medicine to erase your pain, you might miss the real gift. The insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated, not erased.\n\nHealing happens at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.\n\nAnd underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.\n\nHow does that sit?",
  "system6": "I dont know. Sounds like hippie shit but... I guess I want to believe theres something underneath all this.",
  "user6": "Sounds like hippie shit to me too sometimes. But here we are - both wanting to believe there's something underneath.\n\nThat's the core teaching. Healing isn't becoming someone new. It's remembering who you already are beneath the layers.\n\nYou've taken in today's teaching. Now let's capture what's landing for you.\n\nOne sentence: what's your main takeaway about healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system7": "Maybe Im not as broken as I think I am.",
  "user7": "Good. I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system8": "Thanks. Gotta get to work.",
  "user8": "Got it. You've done what matters for today.\n\nTake care out there.",
  "system9": "Thanks.",
  "user9": "You're welcome. See you tomorrow.",
  "system10": "Yeah. Tomorrow.",
  "user10": "I've added today's reflection to your dashboard. \n\nDay 1 complete. Rest well.",
  "system11": "Night.",

  "system19": "Same shit. Woke up again. Couldn\u2019t breathe. Amanda\u2019s sleeping in the guest room now.",
  "user19": "That sounds heavy. Waking up gasping for air, and now the distance between you and Amanda - that's a lot to carry.\n\nHow are you feeling in your body right now, in this moment?"
