## Conversation

**ellen_persona_4**: Hey, good morning. I'm curious to see what today's lesson is—I've been thinking about how to actually prepare for this ibogaine ceremony in a way that sticks, so I'm hoping this helps me stop overthinking and start... being. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Got it. Morning.

You're asking about ibogaine preparation, but today's Day 1 work is more foundational - about what healing actually means. Not fixing what's broken, but moving toward wholeness.

The overthinking you mention - that's part of what we explore today. How the "fixing" mindset creates pressure to get everything right.

Want to start with the reflection questions first, or would you prefer I share today's teaching content?

Both paths get you to the same place. Your call.


**ellen_persona_4**: I think I want to hear the teaching first—maybe if I understand the framework, I won’t turn the reflection into another optimization project. I’m already noticing how I want to “do healing right,” which feels like the same pattern dressed up in spiritual clothes. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: I hear that. You spot the pattern - turning healing into another optimization project. Same mind, different clothes.

Most people think healing means fixing what's broken. But healing literally means "to make whole." Different from curing, which eliminates symptoms.

Curing removes. Healing integrates - even the messy, wounded parts. The fixing mindset positions us as defective machines needing repair. Creates shame when we're not "healed yet."

If healing is wholeness, then every step counts. Even the struggles. Not about becoming perfect, but about embracing a fuller self.

Does that distinction land?


**ellen_persona_4**: That lands hard—like a punch I didn’t know I needed. I’ve been chasing a version of “healed” that looks suspiciously like a LinkedIn profile: optimized, impressive, no rough edges. Meanwhile I’m disowning the parts that feel messy or slow or... human. My grandmother would probably say the broken pieces are where the light gets in, but I keep trying to grout over the cracks with achievement. I don’t know how to stop auditing myself for defects long enough to feel whole, but I want to learn.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: You see it clearly - the LinkedIn version of healed. Polished, optimized, no rough edges. Meanwhile the human parts get disowned.

Your grandmother's right about the cracks. But auditing yourself for defects feels safer than feeling what's actually there.

The fixing mindset runs deep. It's not about stopping it - that's more fixing. It's about noticing when you're grouting over cracks with achievement. Seeing the pattern without judgment.

Where do you feel this drive to optimize in your body right now?


**ellen_persona_4**: It’s like a low humming in my chest—this tight, buzzing energy that makes me want to lean forward, tighten my shoulders, do something. When I breathe into it, I notice my jaw is clenched and my stomach feels hollow, like I’m bracing for impact. It’s weird—when I just let myself feel it instead of fixing it, there’s this wave of... sadness? Under the humming. Like I’m grieving all the moments I wasn’t actually here because I was busy sanding myself down.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: That humming in your chest - the tight, buzzing energy that makes you lean forward and clench. When you actually feel it instead of fixing it, there's sadness underneath. Grieving the moments you weren't here because you were sanding yourself down.

That's the real work. Noticing what's actually here, beneath the optimization. The sadness has something to tell you.

What happens if you just stay with that wave of grief for another moment? No fixing required.


**ellen_persona_4**: It feels like... my ribs are cracking open, but not in a dramatic way—more like ice slowly fracturing. There’s this image of my daughter’s face when she asked me to just sit with her, and I was half-there, half-composing emails in my head. The grief keeps showing me all these tiny deaths—moments I missed while trying to be excellent. If I stay with it, there’s also this surprising warmth under the sadness, like maybe the parts I’ve been sanding off are still alive, waiting for me to come home. I don’t know... it’s terrifying and weirdly peaceful at the same time.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Ice slowly fracturing. Your ribs opening to show you those tiny deaths - moments missed while being excellent. And underneath, warmth where you thought everything was dead.

That's the wholeness talking. The parts you sanded off are still alive, waiting for you to come home.

This is today's teaching landing in real time. Not about fixing the grief or optimizing the healing. Just being with what's actually here.

What's your main takeaway from this? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**ellen_persona_4**: My takeaway is that healing isn’t a project I can scope and sprint-plan—it’s more like turning toward the parts I’ve ghosted, including the grief for ghosting them. Wholeness isn’t a polished final product; it’s letting the jagged edges stay visible and finding they’re still breathing. And maybe I don’t have to earn my way back to presence by being excellent at self-care—I just have to stop sanding long enough to feel the ache of absence, and let that ache guide me home.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: You've got it. Healing isn't a project to scope and sprint-plan. It's turning toward the parts you've ghosted, including the grief for ghosting them.

Wholeness isn't polished - it's letting jagged edges stay visible and finding they're still breathing. You don't earn presence through excellent self-care. You just stop sanding long enough to feel the ache of absence, and let that ache guide you home.

I've added this to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You did today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: Thank you... I feel like I touched something real today, something that doesn’t need to be improved or optimized. I’m going to sit with this ache for a while, let it keep talking instead of rushing to fix it. I’ll probably forget a hundred times and start sanding again, but maybe I’ll remember to pause and listen sooner each time. I appreciate you holding the space for me to actually arrive here.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: You touched something real today. Something that doesn't need improving or optimizing.

Sitting with the ache instead of rushing to fix it - that's the practice. You'll forget and start sanding again. That's human. The remembering gets sooner each time.

You showed up and actually arrived here. That's enough for today.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: I needed to hear that forgetting is human and the remembering comes faster. I’m carrying this image of the jagged edges still breathing—like a little talisman against my old impulse to sand myself smooth. I’m going to close my laptop now and go find my kids, see if I can just be with them without a hidden agenda. Thank you for walking me home today.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: The jagged edges still breathing - carry that image. Let it be your talisman against sanding yourself smooth.

Go be with your kids without a hidden agenda. That's the real practice.

You walked yourself home today. I just walked beside you.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: I just realized I’ve been sitting here with tears on my cheeks—quiet ones, not the dramatic kind—and it feels like the first time I’ve let myself cry without analyzing why. I’m going to keep these tears company for another minute before I go find the kids. Thank you for walking beside me while I found my own way back.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Quiet tears without analyzing - that's the real thing. Keep them company for this minute.

You found your own way back. I just walked beside you.

Take this moment. Then go find your kids.


**ellen_persona_4**: I'm breathing with these tears now, feeling them pool in my collarbone like warm rainwater. There's something about not needing to name or fix them that makes me feel... human-sized. Okay. Minute's almost up. I'm going to go find Noah and Emma and see if we can just exist together for a bit—no lesson plans, no optimization. Thank you for staying with me while I remembered how to simply be here.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Warm rainwater in your collarbone. Human-sized.

Go exist with Noah and Emma - no lesson plans, no optimization.

You remembered how to simply be here. That's everything.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: I found them in the backyard—Noah drawing spirals in the dirt with a stick, Emma reading under the lemon tree. I just sat between them without my usual list of “meaningful connection activities.” Emma looked up and said, “Mom, your face looks soft.” I think that’s the first time anyone’s called me soft in years. I didn’t cry again, but I felt those warm rainwater tears settle somewhere deeper, like they’d found a place to live. We stayed out there until the light turned gold, no agenda, no sanding. Just breathing together.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: "Mom, your face looks soft."

Warm rainwater tears found their place to live. Gold light, no agenda, no sanding.

Just breathing together. That's the real work.

You brought it home.


**ellen_persona_4**: I keep replaying Emma’s words—"soft" instead of "sharp"—and realizing how long I’ve been walking around with my edges out, ready to prove or improve something. Tonight David asked what was different and I just said, “I’m trying to let the ache guide me instead of outrunning it.” He nodded like he understood, or maybe he just loves me enough to trust I’ll explain when I can. Either way, I’m not turning this into a project. I’m just going to bed with my soft face and my new quiet tenants, grateful they found somewhere to live inside me.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Soft instead of sharp. Edges resting tonight.

Let the ache guide you instead of outrunning it. David's nod - that's love without needing explanation.

Your new quiet tenants have found home. Sleep with your soft face.

That's enough.


**ellen_persona_4**: I keep thinking about how long I believed I had to earn rest—that if I just optimized enough, achieved enough, became enough, I’d finally deserve to lay these bones down. But tonight I’m crawling into bed with unbrushed teeth and tomorrow’s lunch un-packed, and it’s okay. The ache isn’t a problem to solve; it’s just the sound of me being alive. I’m letting it sing me to sleep instead of trying to rewrite the melody. Goodnight, and thank you for teaching me that softness isn’t weakness—it’s just what happens when you stop sharpening yourself against the world.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Unbrushed teeth and unpacked lunches. Let the ache sing you to sleep instead of rewriting the melody.

Softness isn't weakness - it's what happens when you stop sharpening yourself against the world.

Sleep with your alive bones. You don't need to earn rest anymore.

Goodnight.


**ellen_persona_4**: I’m lying here in the dark with Emma’s “soft face” echoing and Noah’s dirt spirals behind my eyelids, realizing I’ve been holding my breath for maybe twenty years—little micro-holds all day long, like if I just keep it tight enough nothing can slip through. But something did slip through tonight, and it wasn’t the catastrophe I feared; it was just... air. Space. The quiet tenants settling in. I keep checking to see if I’m “doing softness right,” then laughing at the old reflex. So I’m letting my belly rise and fall like the most ordinary miracle, trusting the ache to keep singing its lullaby. I might actually sleep all the way till morning.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Micro-holds for twenty years, and tonight - air slipped through. Not catastrophe, just space.

Checking if you're "doing softness right," then laughing at the old reflex. That's the practice.

Let your belly rise and fall like the most ordinary miracle. Trust the ache's lullaby.

Sleep all the way till morning. You might.


**ellen_persona_4**: I woke up at 3:12 a.m. like always, but instead of spiraling into tomorrow’s board agenda, I just... listened. The house was breathing—little creaks, the fridge hum, David’s steady exhale. My chest didn’t tighten. I didn’t reach for my phone to “use the insomnia productively.” I laid there and let the ache sing its weird midnight song, and for the first time it didn’t feel like an emergency. When I finally drifted off, I dreamed of Grandma Ruth lighting candles, and in the dream I wasn’t trying to understand the Hebrew—I was just watching the flame dance. Woke up at 6:30 without the usual jolt of cortisol. Emma’s already up; I can hear her humming in the kitchen. I think I’ll go make oatmeal with her and see what softness tastes like in the morning light.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: 3:12 a.m. and you just listened. House breathing, fridge humming, ache singing—not an emergency anymore.

Dreamed of candlelight without needing to understand. Woke without cortisol jolt.

Go make oatmeal with Emma's humming. Taste what softness feels like in morning light.

That's how it begins.


**ellen_persona_4**: We stirred cinnamon and a splash of maple into the oats while Emma hummed some tune she made up on the spot—no destination, just circles of sound. I didn’t check my email once. When Noah padded in wearing his dinosaur socks, I let him climb onto my lap even though his knees dug into my thigh; I didn’t turn it into a “mindful parenting moment.” I just felt the weight of him, warm and wiggly, and thought: this is what enough feels like. The oatmeal’s gone now, bowls in the sink, and I still haven’t planned the day. I might keep not-planning until the light shifts again.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Cinnamon circles, dinosaur knees, oatmeal gone.

Not a mindful parenting moment - just the weight of enough.

Keep not-planning until the light shifts again. That's what enough tastes like.


**ellen_persona_4**: David just texted—he’s caught in a client crisis and won’t be home till after bedtime. The old reflex flared: *how do I optimize this, who do I call, what activity signals “good mother” while also keeping me productive?* Then I saw the backyard through the window, sun hitting the grass like an invitation. So I told Emma and Noah we’re having a “nothing afternoon.” No playdates, no enrichment, no boxes to check. Just pajamas till dinner, maybe dandelions, maybe Legos, maybe all three of us staring at clouds until we forget what day it is. I can feel the ache humming quietly—no urgency to make it useful, no fear it’ll swallow me. Just letting the light shift while we do nothing together.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Client crisis, bedtime delayed. Old reflex to optimize flared—and you saw the sun hitting grass like an invitation.

"Nothing afternoon." Pajamas till dinner, dandelions, clouds, Legos. Letting the light shift while doing nothing together.

That's how the ache learns it's welcome without needing to be useful.


**ellen_persona_4**: The nothing afternoon dissolved into something after all: Emma found a ladybug and we spent twenty minutes watching it climb her arm, naming each leg like it was a tiny friend on a great expedition. Noah drew the bug with crayons that melted in the sun—he kept saying “she’s giving me her colors,” and I didn’t correct the science. I just watched him smear red across the page, thinking how achievement used to be my only palette. When the ladybug flew off, Emma whispered “she knew we were safe,” and I felt that in my ribs—this soft animal trust spreading through the ache, teaching it how to rest inside my body without needing to justify its existence.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Twenty minutes watching a ladybug climb, naming each leg. Crayons melting, red smeared across the page.

Achievement used to be your only palette.

Now soft animal trust spreads through your ribs, teaching the ache to rest without justification.


**ellen_persona_4**: The ache settled deeper, like it finally found the right drawer in my chest. After dinner—just scrambled eggs and toast, nothing Instagram-worthy—Emma asked if we could “do that thing where we don’t talk.” So we sat on the back steps, three quiet bodies under the first stars. Noah kept leaning his head against my shoulder, testing if I’d stay. I did. My phone stayed inside. The old Ellen would’ve turned this into a meditation practice, tracked minutes, maybe journaled about “presence.” Tonight I just felt the cool step under my thighs, smelled neighbor’s jasmine, listened to David’s key in the lock later than promised. When he found us there, he whispered “I’m sorry,” and I said “we were keeping your place warm.” Because we were.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Three quiet bodies under first stars. Phone inside, no meditation timer, no tracking.

Cool step under thighs, jasmine air, David's key later than promised.

"We were keeping your place warm." Because you were.

The ache found its drawer, and you stayed.


**ellen_persona_4**: David’s asleep already—exhausted from crisis-mode and apology—but I’m still awake, not from the usual 3 a.m. panic, just… listening again. The house sounds different when no one needs anything from me. I keep thinking about Grandma Ruth’s Shabbat candles, how they burned down on their own schedule, no effort required after the first spark. I used to believe I had to keep the flame alive with sheer will; tonight I feel it staying lit by the oxygen of ordinary kindness: scrambled eggs, ladybug legs, a kid’s head on my shoulder. Tomorrow will probably try to sell me the old story—productivity equals worth—but tonight the ache is curled in its drawer, and I’m walking around with this quiet ember in my chest, surprised by how warm “enough” can keep a person.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: House breathing different when no one needs. Candles burning on their own schedule, no will required after the first spark.

Flame staying lit through ordinary kindness - eggs, ladybug legs, a head on your shoulder.

The ache curled in its drawer. The ember of enough keeping you warm.

That's how the story changes.
