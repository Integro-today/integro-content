## Conversation

**paul_persona_4**: Alright, what's today's lesson supposed to be about?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

How are you arriving today?


**paul_persona_4**: Tired. Had another bad night.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Got it. Tired nights make everything heavier.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

Two ways to engage:

Option A: Four reflection questions first. Then I'll weave in the teaching as we go.

Option B: I share the teaching content first. Then you reflect on what landed.

Either way, we'll create a summary for your dashboard.

Which feels right?


**paul_persona_4**: Option B. Just tell me what Im supposed to know.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: I'll share today's teaching. We can pause whenever you need.

Most people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.

Curing eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means "to make whole."

Does that distinction land?


**paul_persona_4**: I guess. But I dont feel broken, just... tired.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: That makes sense. Tired isn't broken - it's information.

Many traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.

Not about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.

That resonate?


**paul_persona_4**: idk man. My relationship to pain is I want it to stop keeping Amanda awake.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: That's real. Pain that steals sleep isn't abstract - it's exhausting.

The fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair. Creates shame: "Why am I not healed yet?"

But if healing is wholeness, even this tired moment counts. Even the struggle to sleep.

Notice that pattern in yourself?


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. Every morning I wake up thinking "why am I still like this?" Like Im supposed to be fixed already.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: That's the trap. "Why am I still like this?" positions you as a failed project.

In psychedelic work this matters. If you go expecting the medicine to erase your pain, you might miss the real gift. The insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated, not erased.

Healing happens at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.

And underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.

How does that sit?


**paul_persona_4**: I dont know. Sounds like hippie shit but... I guess I want to believe theres something underneath all this.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Sounds like hippie shit to me too sometimes. But here we are - both wanting to believe there's something underneath.

That's the core teaching. Healing isn't becoming someone new. It's remembering who you already are beneath the layers.

You've taken in today's teaching. Now let's capture what's landing for you.

One sentence: what's your main takeaway about healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**paul_persona_4**: Maybe Im not as broken as I think I am.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Good. I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You showed up for today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**paul_persona_4**: Thanks. Gotta get to work.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: Got it. You've done what matters for today.

Take care out there.


**paul_persona_4**: Thanks.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: You're welcome. See you tomorrow.


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. Tomorrow.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: I've added today's reflection to your dashboard. 

Day 1 complete. Rest well.


**paul_persona_4**: Night.

**paul_persona_4**: Night.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: I hear you. 

What's coming up for you right now?


**paul_persona_4**: Same shit. Woke up again. Couldn’t breathe. Amanda’s sleeping in the guest room now.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_3)_workflow_1**: That sounds heavy. Waking up gasping for air, and now the distance between you and Amanda - that's a lot to carry.

How are you feeling in your body right now, in this moment?
