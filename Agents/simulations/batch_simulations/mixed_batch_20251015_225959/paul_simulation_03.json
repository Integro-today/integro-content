  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with... well, with everything going to hell at home. Amanda's about had it with me, and I can't say I blame her. \n\nI wake up most nights shouting. She says I scare her sometimes. I hate that more than anything. So here I am, three weeks out from this thing in Costa Rica, willing to try whatever it takes to not lose my family.",
  "system1": "Night terrors pushing Amanda away. That's a heavy thing to carry.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without shouting, what changes between you and Amanda?",
  "user1": "I don't know... maybe I'd actually get some rest instead of dragging through each day like a zombie. Maybe she wouldn't look at me like I'm some kind of bomb that could go off any second.\n\nRight now she sleeps in the guest room half the time. Says it's better that way. I pretend it doesn't bother me but... it's like we're roommates instead of husband and wife. If I could just sleep like a normal person, maybe we could... I don't know, talk again. Really talk, not just about the kids' schedules or what's for dinner.\n\nI miss how it used to be, before I turned into this guy who can't shut his brain off at night.",
  "system2": "You want real conversations with Amanda again, not just logistics. And your body's stuck in overdrive when it should be resting.\n\nWhat's underneath the night terrors? What part of you is still on watch when everything should be quiet?",
  "user2": "I don't have PTSD. I just... my head won't shut up at night. It's like I'm still flying missions, you know? Checking instruments, watching for threats, making sure my wingman's got my six.\n\nSometimes it's the explosions. Sometimes it's the guys who didn't make it back. But mostly it's this feeling that I missed something, that if I'd just been better, faster, smarter... maybe they'd still be here.\n\nI know it's bullshit. I did my job. We all did. But when I'm trying to sleep, it's like my brain's still up there, still responsible for keeping everyone alive. Can't turn it off. Can't stand down.",
  "system3": "Three main threads:\n\n1. Finding peace from the night terrors so you and Amanda can share a bed again\n2. Teaching your nervous system the war is over - you can stand down now\n3. Releasing the weight of feeling responsible for lives you couldn't save\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "Yeah... that's about right. Though I don't know about this \"stand down\" business. Makes it sound like I'm some broken soldier who can't hack it.\n\nI just want to sleep. Want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm damaged goods. Want to stop feeling like I failed those guys every damn night.\n\nHow do we turn that into whatever these intention things are supposed to be?",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I release the weight of responsibility for lives I couldn't save\n3. I reclaim being present with Amanda without feeling like damaged goods\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "Look, this all sounds... I don't know, too soft. \"I welcome peaceful sleep\" - that's not how I talk. I'm not asking the universe for a damn thing.\n\nHow about something like... \"I sleep through the night without waking up Amanda.\" Simple. Direct. No fluff.\n\nAnd that second one... \"I release the weight\" - I don't even know what that means. Maybe just... \"I stop carrying what isn't mine to carry.\"\n\nThe third one's not bad. Though I'd say it more like... \"I show up as the man Amanda married, not this angry ghost she's stuck with now.\"\n\nThat better.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I sleep through the night without waking up Amanda\"\n\nYour words land better. Clear and direct.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I stop carrying what isn't mine to carry\"\n\nThat's sharper. Gets right to it.\n\nHow does Intention 3 feel: \"I show up as the man Amanda married, not this angry ghost she's stuck with now\"\n\nReady to move forward with that one?",
  "user5": "Yeah. That one's good.\n\nThough I hate that she sees me like that. Like I'm some ghost of who I used to be. But if that's what it takes to get back to being someone worth staying married to... then that's what I need to focus on.\n\nThree weeks. Think these intentions will actually do anything, or is this just feel-good nonsense?",
  "system6": "You've got three solid intentions:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up Amanda\n2. I stop carrying what isn't mine to carry  \n3. I show up as the man Amanda married, not this angry ghost she's stuck with now\n\nHow do you want to keep them close for the next three weeks? Some options:\n- Write them on a card in your wallet\n- Read them before bed each night\n- Keep them where you keep your flight gear\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user6": "I keep my pilot's license in my wallet - been carrying that thing for twenty years. Put these on the back of a business card or something, keep them right behind the license. Check it when I reach for cash, when I flash my ID at the airport.\n\nBefore bed might be too much right now. Amanda already thinks I'm acting weird enough with this whole retreat thing. Don't need her catching me reciting affirmations like some self-help junkie.\n\nBut I look at that license every time I fly. Every time I travel for work. Reminds me who I used to be. Maybe these can remind me who I want to become.",
  "system7": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up Amanda\n2. I stop carrying what isn't mine to carry  \n3. I show up as the man Amanda married, not this angry ghost she's stuck with now\n\nYour ritual: Keep them behind your pilot's license. Every time you reach for your wallet, you'll remember.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I've got my compass.\n\nThree weeks. Then Costa Rica. Then... whatever happens happens.\n\nThanks for walking through this. Not my usual kind of mission planning, but... I guess we'll see if it works.\n\nTell Amanda I'll be home for dinner.",
  "system8": "Good. Trust what emerges.",
  "user8": "Copy that.",
  "system9": "Roger that.",
  "user9": "Heh. You speak the language.",
  "system10": "Some of it stuck from working with enough vets. Safe flying.",
  "user10": "Appreciate it. Maybe I'll actually get some sleep tonight.",
  "system11": "That would be a solid start.",
  "user11": "Would be the first time in months I haven\u2019t jolted her awake. She deserves that much.",
  "system12": "She does. And so do you.",
  "user12": "Maybe. Still feels like I\u2019m cheating\u2014getting help, I mean. Like I should\u2019ve handled this myself.",
  "system13": "Getting help isn\u2019t cheating. It\u2019s just the next move.",
  "user13": "Hard pill to swallow when you\u2019ve spent twenty years proving you don\u2019t need anybody.",
  "system14": "Different battlefield now. Proving you can let people in might be the mission that saves you.",
  "user14": "I hear you. Just don\u2019t know how to take the safety off that part of me.",
  "system15": "Start small. Pick one moment tomorrow where you don\u2019t check the locks a second time. Let her see you do it.",
  "user15": "...I can try. Might feel like I\u2019m walking out the door without my sidearm, but I\u2019ll try.",
  "system16": "That's the work right there. One disarmed moment at a time.",
  "user16": "One. Hell, I can count that high.",
  "system17": "Good. Keep count. When you hit five, you\u2019ll know you\u2019re building something real.",
  "user17": "Five... that\u2019s a week of mornings I don\u2019t wake up swinging. If I get there, maybe I\u2019ll let myself believe this plant stuff isn\u2019t just hooey.",
  "system18": "Five mornings without swinging. That\u2019s a solid marker.\n\nWhat brought you to ayahuasca?",
  "user18": "Heroic Hearts pulled me off the wait list. Said the shamans down at Rythmia work with vets who can\u2019t shut the engine off. I told \u2019em I don\u2019t have PTSD, just need some damn sleep, but they still slid me in. Figured if I come back without punching the headboard, Amanda might stop looking at me like I\u2019m a live grenade on the nightstand.",
  "system19": "No PTSD label, just no sleep and Amanda sleeping on the couch. Heroic Hearts sees the engine that won't idle.\n\nWhat happens if the headboard stays unpunched - what else shifts between you and Amanda?",
  "user19": "She might quit flinching when I roll over. Maybe she\u2019ll crawl back into our bed instead of the guest room. Hell, maybe I\u2019ll stop hearing my own heartbeat like it\u2019s rotor wash and she\u2019ll talk to me about grocery lists and parent-teacher night instead of tiptoeing around the house like I\u2019m a damn minefield."
