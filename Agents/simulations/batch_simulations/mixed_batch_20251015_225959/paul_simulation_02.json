  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts accepted me. Said this might help with... the sleep issues. Amanda's about had it with me waking up shouting every other night. I don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff, but I can't lose her. That's all I got.",
  "system1": "Heroic Hearts, sleep issues, Amanda's at her limit. You don't need to buy the philosophy - you need the results.\n\nWhat happens when you wake up shouting? What's your body experiencing in those moments?",
  "user1": "I'm back there. Engine noise, smoke in the cockpit, alarms going off. Sometimes it's the mountains rushing up, sometimes it's\u2014it's worse. I'm drenched, heart's pounding like I'm about to die. Takes me a minute to figure out I'm in my own bedroom, not... somewhere else. Amanda's looking at me like I'm a stranger.",
  "system2": "You're back in the cockpit, dying, then suddenly you're in your bedroom with Amanda looking at you like she doesn't know you anymore.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without those moments, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user2": "...I don't know. Maybe I could actually rest. Not feel like I'm bracing for the next thing all the time. Amanda wouldn't have to sleep with one eye open, waiting for me to lose it. The kids... they wouldn't hear me yelling about things they don't understand. I could just be... normal again. Whatever that means.",
  "system3": "Rest without bracing, Amanda sleeping without watching you, kids not hearing you yell about things they can't see. Three pieces here - the nightmares, the constant edge-waiting, and showing up for family.\n\nWhat's underneath the bracing? What's your body still protecting you from?",
  "user3": "I don't... it's just how it is now. Always waiting for the next threat. Like I'm still flying missions, checking my six every minute. Can't let my guard down or\u2014Christ, I don't even know what I'm protecting against anymore. The war's over, I'm home selling insurance. But my body doesn't know that. It's like I'm still trying to bring everyone home safe, except there's no mission. Just... Tuesday.",
  "system4": "Three main threads:\n\n1. Finding peace from the nightmares so you can actually rest at night\n2. Teaching your body the war's over - you're home selling insurance, not flying combat \n3. Being present with Amanda and the kids instead of scanning for threats that don't exist here\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Yeah. That's... that's it. I hate that I need help with this, but I can't keep running on empty. Can't keep losing pieces of myself every night.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep and rest through the night\n2. I teach my body it's home now, the missions are complete\n3. I show up fully for Amanda and the kids without scanning for threats\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "The second one's not right. \"Teaching my body\" sounds... soft. Like I'm some kind of patient. I'm not broken, I just need to get my shit together. And \"missions are complete\" - they never really complete, do they? Some of my guys didn't make it back. That's not something you just... finish.\n\nCan we say it different?",
  "system6": "I hear that. \"Teaching\" feels too soft, and missions don't just complete when brothers are still over there.\n\nHow about: \"I command my body to stand down when I'm home\" - that feel more like your voice?",
  "user6": "Now we're talking. \"I command my body to stand down when I'm home.\" That feels like something I can actually do. Like I'm the pilot here, not some... victim of my own wiring.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I command my body to stand down when I'm home\"\n\nThat shift - from teaching to commanding - that's your voice. Pilot language.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user7": "The first one about peaceful sleep... I don't know. \"Welcome\" sounds too gentle, like I'm asking nicely for something I should be able to just do. And the third one - \"show up fully\" - that's therapist talk. I'm not trying to be \"fully present\" or whatever. I just want to stop being a goddamn ghost in my own house.",
  "system8": "Right. \"Welcome\" sounds like you're asking permission, and \"show up fully\" is therapy-speak.\n\nHow about:\n1. \"I sleep through the night without the war following me home\"\n3. \"I stay here with my family instead of disappearing into my head\"\n\nThat more your language?",
  "user8": "Yeah. That's... that's better. Especially the third one - \"disappearing into my head\" - that's exactly what happens. I'm sitting at dinner but I'm not really there. Amanda's talking about her day and I'm checking exits, replaying some bullshit from fifteen years ago. \n\nThe first one's good too. War following me home - that's what it feels like every damn night.",
  "system9": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I sleep through the night without the war following me home\"\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I stay here with my family instead of disappearing into my head\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions:\n- I sleep through the night without the war following me home\n- I command my body to stand down when I'm home  \n- I stay here with my family instead of disappearing into my head\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Keep them on a card in your flight bag\n- Read them before you walk in the house each night\n- Put them where you keep your wings\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user9": "My wings... haven't taken those out in years. They're in a box in the closet with my uniforms. Can't... can't look at them. Not yet.\n\nBut the flight bag - that's where I keep my logbook, my charts. Stuff I use every day. Yeah. I can write them on a card and keep it there. Read them when I'm driving home from work, before I walk through that door. Before I have to decide who I'm going to be tonight.",
  "system10": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I sleep through the night without the war following me home\n- I command my body to stand down when I'm home\n- I stay here with my family instead of disappearing into my head\n\nYour ritual: Read them from your flight bag card before walking through the door. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user10": "Three weeks. Flight bag's ready. I can do this.",
  "system11": "You're set. Trust what emerges.",
  "user11": "Copy that.",
