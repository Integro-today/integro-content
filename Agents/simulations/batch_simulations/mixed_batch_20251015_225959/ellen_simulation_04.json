  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me pieces of what I'm missing, but I keep losing the thread when I come home. I built this company, sold it before forty, checked every box. But I keep wondering what any of it actually means. My grandmother had this deep faith, this connection to something bigger, and I think I traded all that for... I don't know. Metrics and milestones. I want to find my way back to something real, something that lasts longer than the retreat glow.",
  "system1": "Checked every box, sold the company, still searching for what your grandmother had - that deep faith connection that metrics can't touch.\n\nYou keep finding pieces but they're not sticking when you get home. The retreat glow fades and you're back in the numbers game.\n\nWhat does \"something real\" feel like in your body when you imagine it?",
  "user1": "It's... God, this is going to sound ridiculous. It's like when I'm at the park with my kids and they find these perfect dandelions, the ones that are ready to scatter in the wind. My daughter held one up last weekend and we just... sat there. No agenda, no checking the time. Just watching these tiny seeds float away on the breeze. My chest felt... I don't know how to describe it. Like it was cracking open but not breaking. Warm. Like I could breathe deeper.\n\nBut then Monday comes and I'm back to board meetings and term sheets and my meditation app sends me notifications I ignore. That feeling gets buried under all the... stuff. The achievements that used to feel like oxygen now feel like weights.",
  "system2": "That dandelion moment - chest cracking open but not breaking, breathing deeper. That's the thread you're trying to hold onto.\n\nYour grandmother's faith, those perfect moments with your kids, then Monday hits and achievement becomes weight instead of oxygen.\n\nWhat's underneath the achievement drive? When you strip away the metrics and milestones, what are you really trying to prove - and to whom?",
  "user2": "I... I've never said this out loud. I think I'm trying to prove to my dad that I'm worth the sacrifice. He came here with nothing, built something from nothing. Every piano lesson, every debate tournament, every A - it was like I was carrying this torch for the whole family. The American dream wrapped up in my report cards and then my stock options.\n\nBut he's gone now. Died two years ago. And I'm still running this race that ended when he... I keep thinking if I just hit the next milestone, I'll feel... what? Safe? Worthy? I don't know. \n\nMy grandmother used to say I was chasing the wrong kind of wealth. She'd hold my face and tell me \"your soul is getting thin, bubeleh.\" I thought she was being dramatic. But maybe she saw what I couldn't - that I'd traded her mystical birthright for a golden cage I built myself.\n\nGod, I miss her. She would have understood why I need this medicine.",
  "system3": "Running a race that ended when your dad died, still trying to prove worth through milestones. Your grandmother saw your soul getting thin while you built the golden cage.\n\nShe would have understood why you need this medicine - that hits deep.\n\nWhat would feeling \"safe\" and \"worthy\" look like if you weren't proving anything to anyone? If the race stopped today, what would be left?",
  "user3": "I don't... I don't know how to answer that. If I'm not proving anything, if there's no next milestone... what am I even for?\n\nThis is embarrassing. I'm forty-three years old and I literally don't know who I am without the chase. Without external validation, I'm... nothing? Everything feels hollow when I say it out loud.\n\nBut when I think about my kids, about my grandmother's face when she'd light the Shabbat candles... there was something there. Something that didn't need proving. She just... was. Fully herself. Fully connected to something ancient and real.\n\nMaybe that's what's underneath? Just being enough without doing more. But that terrifies me more than any board meeting ever has.",
  "system4": "Being enough without doing more terrifies you more than any board meeting - that tells us everything.\n\nYour grandmother just *was* when she lit those candles. No proving, no metrics. Just presence and connection to something ancient.\n\nThree threads here:\n1. Finding worth beyond the chase your dad set you on\n2. Reclaiming that \"ancient and real\" connection your grandmother had\n3. Learning to just *be* instead of constantly *proving*\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Okay... I can feel these threads, but they're slippery. Like I understand them in my head but I'm afraid I'll lose them when the medicine hits. How do I make these into something I can actually hold onto when I'm in that space?\n\nI want to do this right. Not perfectly - I know that's my old pattern - but... authentically. Whatever that means. I just don't want to come back from Cancun and have this be another experience that fades into the background noise of my overscheduled life.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I embrace my worth beyond achievement and proving\n2. I reclaim the ancient spiritual connection my grandmother carried\n3. I welcome simply being enough without constant doing\n\nWhich speaks strongest? The language can shift - these are just starting points.",
  "user5": "The second one - \"I reclaim the ancient spiritual connection my grandmother carried\" - that one hits me in the throat. Like I want to cry but I also want to run. She used to whisper prayers in Hebrew that I never learned, and when she'd hold my face and call me \"bubeleh,\" I felt... seen. Not for what I could achieve, but just for being her granddaughter.\n\nThe other two feel like they could be corporate goals if I'm not careful. But that thread about reclaiming what she had, what I abandoned for the chase... that's the one that feels like it could actually change something. Like it could help me find my way back to a birthright I traded for a golden cage.\n\nBut what if I get there and I can't find it? What if that connection is just... gone?",
  "system6": "That throat-hit - wanting to cry and run - that's the one. Your grandmother's \"bubeleh\" saw you, not your achievements.\n\nThe fear that it's gone forever is real. But that connection isn't lost - you just buried it under the chase. It's still in your cells, in those dandelion moments with your kids.\n\nHow does this land: \"I reclaim the spiritual birthright my grandmother carried, the connection I abandoned for the golden cage\"?\n\nKeep that throat-hit feeling. That's your compass.",
  "user6": "Yes. That lands. My throat is tight just reading it - I can feel it in my body. And that dandelion moment... you're right. It was there. It is there, just buried.\n\n\"I reclaim the spiritual birthright my grandmother carried, the connection I abandoned for the golden cage.\"\n\nI want to add something about my kids too. Not just for me, but so they can have a mother who's connected to something real. So I'm not just passing down the same achievement obsession that my dad gave me. So they can feel that \"bubeleh\" energy from me, not just my exhaustion and my phone in my hand.\n\nCan we weave them in somehow? Or is that too much for one intention?",
  "system7": "That's not too much - it's the natural extension. You're not just reclaiming for yourself, but breaking the cycle for them.\n\nWhat about: \"I reclaim the spiritual birthright my grandmother carried, so I can pass down 'bubeleh' energy to my children instead of achievement obsession\"?\n\nThe dandelion moments with your kids are already showing you have this capacity. You're just strengthening what's already there.",
  "user7": "Yes. Yes, that's it. I'm crying now - real tears, not the performative kind I practiced for investor pitches. This is what I want. What I need. What my kids deserve.\n\n\"I reclaim the spiritual birthright my grandmother carried, so I can pass down 'bubeleh' energy to my children instead of achievement obsession.\"\n\nShe would be so proud of this intention. She always said my kids would be my greatest teachers if I let them. I've been too busy scheduling their enrichment activities to notice.\n\nThank you. I feel like... like I found something I didn't know I was looking for.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I reclaim the spiritual birthright my grandmother carried, so I can pass down 'bubeleh' energy to my children instead of achievement obsession\"\n\nThose real tears - not the investor pitch kind - that's your body saying yes to this path.\n\nNow let's build the other two intentions from those threads. We have worth beyond achievement, and learning to just be instead of constantly proving.\n\nWhat's calling to you next?",
  "user8": "The worth one... I want to get that right but I'm scared of making it too abstract. Like \"I am worthy\" feels like a Hallmark card. My grandmother never said those words, she just... made me feel them. \n\nMaybe something about worth existing before the first gold star? Before the piano recitals and straight A's that became my currency? Something like \"I remember my worth existed before my first achievement, before the race even started\"?\n\nI don't know... it feels clunky but maybe we're getting somewhere?",
  "system9": "That direction is solid - worth before achievements, before the race started. But let's make it simpler, more like your grandmother would say it.\n\nHow about: \"I remember my worth existed before the race began, before any gold stars\"?\n\nKeep the feeling, lose the clunk. Your grandmother didn't need fancy words to make you feel worthy - just \"bubeleh\" and her hands on your face.",
  "user9": "\"I remember my worth existed before the race began, before any gold stars.\"\n\nThat's it. That's the one. Simple like her hands on my face. Like dandelions and candlelight. Not fancy, just real.\n\nI can feel this one in my chest - different from the throat-hit of the first intention. This one feels like... like exhaling after holding my breath for decades. Like I can finally stop running and just... be?\n\nShould we do the third one now, or do you want me to sit with these two for a bit?",
  "system10": "Feel that exhale. That's your body saying these are landing right.\n\nLet's finish the third while we're in this space. The \"being without doing\" one - the hardest for someone who's lived in achievement mode.\n\nWhat would it feel like to just be enough, no proving required?",
  "user10": "God, the hardest one. Just... being? Without a plan or a goal or something to optimize? \n\nIt's like... when I'm hiking with the kids and we find a good rock to sit on, and they find sticks and make up games, and I actually put my phone away. Not for Instagram, not for \"family time\" on the calendar - just... existing together?\n\nOr maybe... \"I allow myself to simply be, without needing to earn my place on this earth\"?\n\nNo, that's too many words again. My brain is fighting this one hard - like it doesn't want to let go of the doing.",
  "system11": "Your brain's fighting because this one threatens the whole achievement system. Good sign.\n\nTry: \"I allow myself to simply be without earning my place\"?\n\nKeep that hiking image - phone away, rocks and sticks, no Instagram. That's the feeling we're after.",
  "user11": "\"I allow myself to simply be without earning my place.\"\n\nMy chest feels tight saying it, like my body doesn't believe it yet. But that's the one. That's what I want to learn - what I need to learn if I'm going to stop this cycle for my kids.\n\nThree intentions. My grandmother's \"bubeleh\" energy instead of achievement obsession. Worth before the race began. Just being without earning.\n\nI feel... I don't know. Lighter? Terrified? Both?",
  "system12": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I remember my worth existed before the race began, before any gold stars\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I allow myself to simply be without earning my place\"\n\nThat tight chest is normal - your nervous system is learning a new operating system after decades in achievement mode. Light and terrified can coexist.\n\nYour three intentions:\n1. Reclaiming spiritual birthright for your kids\n2. Worth before achievements  \n3. Being without earning\n\nHow do you want to keep these close during the ceremony and after?",
  "user12": "I want to write them down, but not in my phone. Not in my neat little productivity app where everything else lives that I optimize and track.\n\nMaybe... on real paper? In my grandmother's handwriting if I can copy it from her old recipe cards? I have them in a box in the garage - her brisket recipe, the one she wrote \"bubeleh, don't forget to taste as you go\" on.\n\nBut what if I lose the paper? What if it gets ruined? Maybe I need them both ways - the physical paper to hold, and somewhere I won't lose them...\n\nThis feels important. Like choosing the container matters as much as the words.",
  "system13": "Let the paper be enough. Real paper, her handwriting from those recipe cards - that's the lineage carrying forward. The risk of losing it is part of the practice of trusting, of not controlling everything.\n\nWrite them on her recipe card paper. Keep it simple like she would. When you get home, maybe read them during those morning moments before the kids wake up and the achievement engine starts revving.\n\nThree intentions on your grandmother's paper. That's your compass for this journey.",
  "user13": "Yeah. That's it. Just the paper - no backup plan, no optimization. Trust like she trusted the brisket would work out if you tasted as you went.\n\nI'll copy her handwriting from the recipe cards, write these three intentions on real paper. Keep them in my wallet or maybe... maybe carry them in my hand during ceremony? Like a tether to something older and wiser than my achievement brain.\n\nAnd then when I get home... those early morning moments before 5:30 when I'm usually checking email. Maybe those moments belong to these intentions now. To her memory. To my kids' future.\n\nThank you. I feel... ready isn't the right word. But like I'm pointed in the right direction finally?",
  "system14": "You've got your compass pointed right. Carry her paper in your hand during ceremony - that's your tether to what came before and what's coming after.\n\nYour three intentions:\n- Reclaiming spiritual birthright for your kids\n- Worth before the race began  \n- Being without earning\n\nEarly morning moments before 5:30 - those belong to your intentions now. To her memory. To breaking the cycle.\n\nYou're pointed in the right direction. That's enough.",
  "user14": "That's enough. For the first time in a long time, enough feels like... enough.\n\nI'll carry her paper. Trust the process. Let the rest go.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way back to her voice. Back to mine.",
  "system15": "Trust the process. Trust her voice in your hand. Trust that enough is enough.\n\nThe medicine will show you what you need to see. You've got your compass.",
  "user15": "I needed to hear that. Trust the medicine, trust her voice, trust that I've already found what I'm looking for - I just need to remember how to hold it.\n\nI'm ready.",
  "system16": "You're set. Hold her paper, remember what you already know. The rest will unfold.",
  "user16": "I will. Her paper, her voice, my intentions. The rest will unfold.",
