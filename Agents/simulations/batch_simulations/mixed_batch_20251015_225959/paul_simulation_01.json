  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with my... situation. Here I am. I can't keep going like this\u2014waking up shouting, Amanda looking at me like I'm a stranger. Something's gotta give.",
  "system1": "Heroic Hearts sent you here, Amanda's looking at you like you're someone else, and you're waking up shouting. That's enough to bring anyone to plant medicine.\n\nWhat's the worst part right now - the nightmares themselves, or how they're changing everything between you and Amanda?",
  "user1": "The nightmares... they're just dreams, right? But seeing her face when I wake up\u2014like she's scared of me. That's the part I can't take. Twenty years together, and now she flinches when I reach for her. Says I don't even know what I'm saying when I'm shouting. \n\nI never wanted her to see that side of things. Never wanted anyone to see it.",
  "system2": "Twenty years and now she flinches. That's the real wound here - not what happens in your sleep, but what it's doing to the two of you.\n\nWhat do you think she sees when she looks at you like that?",
  "user2": "She sees... I don't know. Someone she doesn't recognize. Someone dangerous, maybe. She says my eyes look different, like I'm still there but not really there. Like I'm looking through her at something else.\n\nI hate that. I'm supposed to be the one who protects her, not someone she needs protection from.",
  "system3": "Your body is back there fighting something that isn't here, and Amanda's catching the crossfire. You're supposed to be her safe place, not the threat.\n\nWhat's underneath the shouting - what are you fighting in those nightmares?",
  "user3": "I... I don't really remember the dreams. Just the feeling. Like I'm falling, or something's coming at me too fast. Sometimes it's the aircraft spinning, sometimes it's just... noise. Loud. Like I'm trying to warn someone but I can't get the words out right.\n\nIt's stupid. It's over, it's done. I shouldn't still be there but my body doesn't seem to know that.",
  "system4": "Your body thinks it's still back there - falling, spinning, trying to warn people. Your mind knows it's over, but your nervous system never got that message.\n\nThree threads here: stopping the nightmares so Amanda can sleep next to you again, teaching your body this is home now, and being present instead of stuck back there.\n\nSound right?",
  "user4": "Yeah. That sounds about right. I just want to sleep through the night and not wake up feeling like I need to fight or run. Want her to feel safe next to me again.\n\nI don't know how to make my body understand it's over. I've tried everything else\u2014exercise, routine, staying busy. Nothing sticks.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I teach my body it's home now, not back there\n3. I embrace being fully present with Amanda instead of stuck in the past\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "Number two hits hardest. \"I teach my body it's home now.\" That's what I need\u2014to stop feeling like I'm still over there when I'm walking through my own damn kitchen.\n\nBut maybe... maybe stronger? \"I command my body to know it's home now.\" I don't want to ask nicely. I want to tell it straight.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I command my body to know it's home now\"\n\nThat's your voice - clear, direct, no asking permission. How do the other two land?",
  "user6": "Number one feels... soft. Too soft. \"Welcome peaceful sleep\" sounds like I'm asking for a favor. I need something more solid than that.\n\nNumber three... I don't know. \"Embrace being fully present\" sounds like something from a self-help book. I just want to be here, not there. Plain and simple.",
  "system7": "Got it. Less asking, more declaring. \n\nFor intention 1 - instead of \"welcome peaceful sleep\" - maybe \"I reclaim my nights so Amanda and I can sleep together again\"?\n\nFor intention 3 - instead of \"embrace being fully present\" - maybe \"I stay here, with Amanda, instead of going back there\"?\n\nHow do those land?",
  "user7": "Yeah. Those work. \"I reclaim my nights\" - that's better. Not asking, taking it back.\n\n\"Stay here, with Amanda, instead of going back there\" - that's exactly what I need. Simple. Direct. No fluff.\n\nThose feel right.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I reclaim my nights so Amanda and I can sleep together again\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I stay here, with Amanda, instead of going back there\"\n\nThree solid intentions ready. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "Good. I needed this. Something to hold onto when things get rough in there. These feel like they fit\u2014like I can actually remember them when I need to.\n\nThanks.",
  "system9": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I reclaim my nights so Amanda and I can sleep together again\n- I command my body to know it's home now\n- I stay here, with Amanda, instead of going back there\n\nKeep these somewhere you'll see them\u2014wallet, nightstand, wherever works. Read them before ceremony. You've got solid ground to stand on when things shift.\n\nTrust what emerges.",
  "user9": "I'll keep them in my wallet. Been carrying that thing for years\u2014seems right to keep these close too.\n\nAppreciate you helping me get this straight. Ready to do this.",
  "system10": "Wallet's perfect. Been through everything with you already.\n\nThree clear intentions locked and loaded. You're set. Trust what comes.",
  "user10": "Yeah. Time to get this done.",
  "system11": "You're ready. Go do the work.",
  "user11": "Copy that. See you on the other side.",
  "system12": "Roger that. Walk steady.",
  "user12": "Always have. Always will.",
  "system13": "That's your compass right there.",
  "user13": "Yeah. It is.",
  "system14": "Hold it close. That's all you need.",
  "user14": "Got it. Let\u2019s roll.",
  "system15": "Move out.",
  "user15": "Moving.",
  "system16": "Good.",
  "user16": "Yeah.",
  "system17": "Keep your feet under you.",
  "user17": "Copy that.",
  "system18": "Solid copy.",
  "user18": "Roger.",
  "system19": "Stay steady.",
  "user19": "Always do."
