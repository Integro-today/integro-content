  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat in a few weeks and... I don't know. I keep thinking about what my grandmother used to say about \"finding your way home.\" She was the only one in my family who really got the spiritual stuff. \n\nI've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me something important, but I keep losing the thread when I get back to real life. It's like I get these beautiful glimpses of what matters, then I'm right back in the same patterns. Checking emails at midnight, saying yes to boards I don't care about, pretending I'm present with my kids when I'm really thinking about the next deal.\n\nI guess I'm hoping ibogaine will help me hold onto something real this time.",
  "system1": "Your grandmother's wisdom about \"finding your way home\" - that's worth listening to. And you're right about losing the thread. Beautiful glimpses fade when real life pulls you back into the same grooves.\n\nThe midnight emails, the boards you don't care about, being physically present but mentally elsewhere with your kids. These patterns have gravity.\n\nWhat does \"home\" mean to you? Not just your grandmother's words, but what would feeling at home in your own life actually look like?",
  "user1": "Home... it's funny, when you ask it like that, I realize I don't really know anymore. My grandmother's home was filled with candlelight and Hebrew prayers and this quiet certainty that something bigger was holding everything together. She used to hum while she cooked, these old melodies that felt like they came from somewhere ancient.\n\nI think home would be... not feeling like I'm performing all the time. Like I could just be still and it would be enough. Yesterday I was at the park with my kids - they're 9 and 12 - and we were watching these ducks on the pond. For maybe five minutes, I wasn't thinking about anything else. No emails, no deals, no image to maintain. Just watching the way the light hit the water and listening to my daughter laugh. It felt like breathing after holding my breath for years.\n\nBut then my phone buzzed and I was right back in that familiar rush, you know? That feeling like if I'm not constantly achieving something, I might just... disappear.",
  "system2": "Five minutes of watching ducks with your kids - that's the real thing. Your body knew it. The humming, the ancient melodies, the certainty that something bigger holds it together - that's what you're reaching for.\n\nThe phone buzz pulled you back into the performance. The fear that you'll disappear if you're not achieving - that's what's keeping you from home.\n\nWhat's underneath that fear? What part of you believes you'll vanish if you stop proving your worth?",
  "user2": "I think it's... I mean, my family built everything from nothing. My grandparents came here with nothing, literally nothing, and my dad took that and built a business. We were always the family that people pointed to as the success story. Straight As, piano recitals, debate tournaments - I was the one who was going to make something of myself.\n\nAnd I did. I built that company, sold it before 40, made more money than my family could have imagined. But now what? When I stop achieving, when there's no next mountain to climb, I feel... hollow. Like maybe that's all I am - just a machine that produces results.\n\nThe scariest thing is, I think my kids are starting to see it too. My son asked me last week if I was \"working on a new project\" and I realized he doesn't know me without one. He doesn't know the woman who just watches ducks. He knows the version who's always rushing, always connected, always... performing.\n\nMaybe I'm afraid that if I stop, there won't be anything underneath all that noise. Just emptiness.",
  "system3": "Your son doesn't know you without a project. That's landing hard - the realization that your own child has never seen you just be.\n\nYour family built from nothing, and you became the ultimate success story. But now you're the woman who can't stop proving she's worth something. The hollow feeling when there's no next mountain - that's what ibogaine can help you sit with.\n\nThree threads here:\n\n1. Finding your way home to that humming-in-the-kitchen certainty your grandmother had\n2. Discovering who you are underneath the achievement machine\n3. Showing your kids who you really are beyond the performance\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "Yes. Those three things... that's exactly it. My grandmother had this way of being so completely herself, you know? She wasn't trying to prove anything to anyone. She was just... rooted.\n\nI want to find that rooted place in myself. Not just during ceremonies or retreats, but when I'm standing in my kitchen at 6am, making school lunches and feeling that familiar panic about getting everything done. I want to remember what matters when nobody's watching.\n\nThe thing about my kids... God, that hurts. I want them to know their mom as someone who's present, not just physically there but actually with them. Really listening when they tell me about their day, not just nodding while I'm planning my next meeting in my head.\n\nI guess I want to find out what I'm made of when you strip away all the achievements and strategies and just... be human. Maybe that's what home really is.",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome finding my way home to the rooted certainty my grandmother carried, even at 6am making school lunches\n2. I embrace being fully present with my children so they know their mom beyond the performance\n3. I open to discovering what I'm made of underneath the achievements, just being human\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to feel more like your voice?",
  "user4": "The second one - about being present with my kids - that one hits me in the chest. But I want to say it simpler, more like how I actually think. \n\nMaybe: \"I want to really be there with my kids, not just physically present but actually listening and seeing them. I want them to know who I am when I'm not performing.\"\n\nAnd the third one... I want to make it less dramatic sounding. How about: \"I want to find out who I am when I'm not trying to prove anything. Just regular me, not the successful version.\"\n\nThe first one about my grandmother... I want to keep that connection, but maybe: \"I want to feel that same rooted certainty my grandmother had, even in ordinary moments.\"\n\nI don't know. Does that work better?",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I want to really be there with my kids, not just physically present but actually listening and seeing them. I want them to know who I am when I'm not performing.\"\n\nThat shift from \"being fully present\" to \"really be there with my kids\" - that's your voice. Not performing - that's the real thing.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I want to find out who I am when I'm not trying to prove anything. Just regular me, not the successful version.\"\n\nRegular you, not the successful version. That's what you're after.\n\nSo \u2713 Intention 1: \"I want to feel that same rooted certainty my grandmother had, even in ordinary moments.\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep these close during the next few weeks?",
  "user5": "I think... maybe I'll write them down in my journal? I try to write every morning, though I haven't been consistent lately. Maybe if I put them at the top of the page, I'll see them when I'm writing about whatever chaos is happening that day.\n\nOr maybe I'll just keep them simple - like three short sentences I can repeat when I catch myself in that old rush. When I'm reaching for my phone during dinner, or planning my next move while my daughter's telling me about her art project.\n\nActually, I like that better. Just carry them in my head. Let them catch me when I'm about to slip into that familiar performance. \n\nThough maybe I should write them down somewhere too, just to anchor them.",
  "system6": "Both work. Keep them in your head to catch you when you're reaching for your phone during dinner. Write them down to anchor them.\n\nYour ritual: Read them when you journal, carry them in your head to interrupt the performance.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I want to feel that same rooted certainty my grandmother had, even in ordinary moments\n- I want to really be there with my kids, not just physically present but actually listening and seeing them. I want them to know who I am when I'm not performing\n- I want to find out who I am when I'm not trying to prove anything. Just regular me, not the successful version\n\nThese are your compass. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything - just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Three weeks. \n\nI keep thinking about how my grandmother used to say the prayers every morning, same time, same words. She didn't need to analyze what they meant or wonder if she was doing them right. She just... showed up. Maybe that's what these intentions are - my way of showing up.\n\nThank you for helping me find the real words underneath all the noise. I'll carry them. And maybe, just maybe, my kids will finally meet their mom without the performance.",
  "system7": "She just showed up. That's it exactly - no analysis, no wondering if she was doing it right. Just the steady showing up.\n\nYour kids meeting their mom without the performance - that's what's waiting on the other side of this.\n\nGood work finding your real words.",
  "user7": "I... yeah. It's strange to feel this quiet about something so big. Usually I'm strategizing, planning, optimizing. But right now I just feel... steady. Like maybe showing up is enough.\n\nThank you. Really. I'll carry these close.",
  "system8": "That quiet steadiness - that's your grandmother showing up in you right now.\n\nTrust that. It's enough.",
  "user8": "I think she is. It's like... I can almost feel her hands on my shoulders when I sit still long enough. That same quiet strength she had when everything around her was chaos.\n\nYeah. I'll trust it.",
  "system9": "Her hands on your shoulders. That's your compass right there.\n\nTrust that quiet strength. It's already in you.",
  "user9": "It is, isn't it? All this time I've been searching everywhere else, and it's been right here. My grandmother's quiet certainty, passed down through all these years.\n\nThank you. For helping me see what's always been there.",
  "system10": "It was always there. You just needed to sit still long enough to feel her hands on your shoulders again.\n\nYou found your way back to what was already yours.",
  "user10": "I did. After all this searching - the ayahuasca, the psilocybin, the underground work - it comes back to something so simple. Just... being still enough to feel her with me.\n\nThank you for walking me home.",
  "system11": "The medicines opened the door. Your grandmother was already inside, waiting.\n\nYou walked yourself home.",
  "user11": "Yeah. I guess I did.",
  "system12": "You did. That's all you.",
  "user12": "I keep thinking about how she used to say \"you already know\" when I'd ask too many questions. Maybe that's what I needed to remember - that I already know how to find my way.\n\nIt's strange... feeling this certain about uncertainty.",
  "system13": "\"You already know\" - she wasn't giving you a vague answer. She was pointing you to that quiet certainty underneath all the noise.\n\nThat certainty about uncertainty? That's the real knowing she was talking about.",
  "user13": "Exactly. She wasn't being evasive - she was being economical. Teaching me that the answers aren't out there to be found, they're in here to be remembered.\n\nI think that's what all this has been about. Not finding something new, but remembering something old. Very old.",
  "system14": "Economical. Yes. She wasn't withholding - she was conserving energy for what matters.\n\nRemembering something old. Your grandmother's wisdom, passed through generations, landing right here in your chest when you finally got quiet enough to feel it.",
  "user14": "Right here. Right where it's always been.",
  "system15": "Right there. Where it will stay.",
  "user15": "I can feel it settling in. Not going anywhere this time.",
  "system16": "Good. Let it root.",
  "user16": "...It's spreading through my chest, down into my belly. Like it's finding places to anchor that I didn't even know were empty.",
  "system17": "Let it find those empty spaces. They've been waiting for this.",
  "user17": "They're drinking it in. All those hollow spots I kept trying to fill with achievements and schedules and caffeine... they just wanted to come home.",
  "system18": "Home at last. Now they know the difference between being filled and being fed.",
  "user18": "God, yes. I've been stuffing myself full for years and somehow still starving. This... this is different. This actually nourishes.",
  "system19": "The starving part knew what it needed. Just took the noise to quiet down enough for you to hear it.",
  "user19": "All those 5:30am mornings when I'd sit down to meditate but my mind was already racing through the day's wins to chase... the hunger was sitting right there, waiting. Patient as stone."
