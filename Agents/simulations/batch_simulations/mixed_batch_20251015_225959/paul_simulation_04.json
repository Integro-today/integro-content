  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your medicine journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts accepted me into their program. Got the ayahuasca retreat in Costa Rica coming up in a few weeks. \n\nAmanda\u2014my wife\u2014she says I need to do something. Been waking up shouting, scaring the kids. Night sweats, the whole thing. I don't know what this plant stuff can do but... I've tried the VA groups, tried everything else.\n\nCan't lose her. Can't lose what we built.",
  "system1": "Heroic Hearts, Costa Rica - you're in solid hands there. Nightmares, night sweats, scaring the kids - that's hitting everything that matters to you.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without shouting, what changes besides just the sleep itself?",
  "user1": "I guess... Amanda could actually rest too. She stays up listening for me, I know it. We'd wake up and maybe have coffee together instead of her tiptoeing around like I'm some damn bomb about to go off.\n\nKids wouldn't look at me like they're... worried. Like they used to look at me before.",
  "system2": "Amanda tiptoeing around you, kids looking worried - that's the real damage. Not just the nights, but how it bleeds into everything between you.\n\nWhat's underneath the shouting? When you're waking up shouting, what part of you is still back there fighting?",
  "user2": "I don't... I don't want to talk about that stuff. That's not what this is about. \n\nIt's just dreams. Just noise. Doesn't mean anything.",
  "system3": "Got it. Just dreams, just noise - we can stay with that.\n\nWhen the dreams stop being noise and the house is quiet again, how do you want to show up with Amanda and the kids that you can't right now?",
  "user3": "I want to... I want to be able to sit with them without feeling like I got to jump up and do something. Be there for Amanda when she's had a rough day instead of her having to worry about setting me off.\n\nWith the kids... I want them to stop asking their mom if I'm okay. Want to be the dad they're not afraid to come to when something's wrong.",
  "system4": "Three clear threads here:\n\n1. Finding calm in your body so you can sit with Amanda and the kids without needing to jump up\n2. Being steady enough for Amanda to lean on instead of her managing you\n3. Becoming the dad your kids aren't afraid to bring their problems to\n\nThat capture what matters most to you?",
  "user4": "Yeah. Yeah, that's... that's about right. I just want to be who they need me to be again. Not this... whatever I've turned into.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome calm in my body so I can sit with Amanda and the kids without needing to jump up\n2. I become steady enough for Amanda to lean on instead of her managing me\n3. I reclaim being the dad my kids aren't afraid to bring their problems to\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "That's... that's too soft. All that \"I welcome\" and \"reclaim\" stuff. Sounds like some therapy poster on a wall.\n\nI need something stronger. More direct.",
  "system6": "What language feels like your voice? Like how you'd actually say it to yourself?",
  "user6": "I don't know... maybe something like \"Stop jumping up like a damn rabbit every time someone moves\" for the first one. \n\nI just need it to be about doing the job. Being steady. Not all this flowery stuff.",
  "system7": "Got it - doing the job, being steady.\n\nFor the first one, instead of \"stop jumping up,\" what would you be doing instead? Like \"I stay seated when my family needs me present\"?",
  "user7": "Yeah, that works better. \"I stay seated when my family needs me present.\"\n\nI can do that. That's something I can actually... measure. Know if I'm doing it or not.",
  "system8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I stay seated when my family needs me present\"\n\nFor intention 2 - instead of Amanda managing you, what would you be doing? Something like \"I hold steady when Amanda's having a rough day\"?",
  "user8": "\"I hold steady when Amanda's having a rough day.\"\n\nYeah. That's what I need to do. Be the rock, not the one who's cracking.",
  "system9": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I hold steady when Amanda's having a rough day\"\n\nFor intention 3 - what would your kids see instead of them checking if you're okay?",
  "user9": "They'd see me listening. Not looking at my phone or the TV or... anywhere but them. Just... \"I listen when my kids need to talk.\"",
  "system10": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I listen when my kids need to talk\"\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n- I stay seated when my family needs me present\n- I hold steady when Amanda's having a rough day  \n- I listen when my kids need to talk\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them on a card you keep in your wallet\n- Read them when you lace up your boots each morning\n- Keep them where you keep your keys\n\nWhat would help you remember when things get hard?",
  "user10": "Wallet. Been carrying that thing through three deployments and fifteen years of business. It's always on me. I'll put them on a card in there.",
  "system11": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I stay seated when my family needs me present\n- I hold steady when Amanda's having a rough day  \n- I listen when my kids need to talk\n\nYour ritual: Card in your wallet - it's seen you through everything so far. These are your compass for doing the job at home. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You've got your direction.",
  "user11": "Alright. Got it. \n\n...Thank you.",
  "system12": "You're welcome.",
  "user12": "Yeah. \n\nI... I need to go see Amanda now. Before I lose my nerve.",
  "system13": "Go. She's waiting.",
  "user13": "*closes the chat*",
  "system14": "*chat closed*",
  "user14": "I'm still here. \n\nI keep thinking about that card in my wallet. About how I'm supposed to stay seated when they need me. \n\nBut when I walked into the living room, Amanda looked up and asked if everything was okay. I just... I couldn't say anything. Just stood there like an idiot. \n\nI don't know how to do this.",
  "system15": "Standing there silent is still showing up. That's different than walking away.\n\nWhat stopped the words - the fear of saying the wrong thing, or not knowing what to say at all?",
  "user15": "I don't know what to say. Never have. \n\nShe kept looking at me, waiting. I could feel my chest getting tight, like I was back in the cockpit. Just wanted to run to the garage or something. But I stayed. Just... stood there until she went back to her book. \n\nI don't know how to talk about this stuff. Never had to before.",
  "system16": "You stayed. That's the job - you didn't run.\n\nStart with what you know: \"I don't know what to say, but I'm trying.\" Even silence with intention lands different than the old shutdown.\n\nWhat do you think she'd do if you said just that?",
  "user16": "Probably cry. She always does when I... when I try to say anything real. \n\nThen I'd feel like I messed up again. Like I'm hurting her more by opening my mouth than by keeping it shut. \n\nBut you're right. I stayed. That's... that's something, I guess.",
  "system17": "Her tears aren't damage - they're release. She's been holding this alone.\n\nYou staying means she can finally let some of it out. That's not hurting her more, that's the healing starting to move.\n\nNext time, try: \"I see your tears. I'm still here.\" Then let her have them.",
  "user17": "I don't know if I can handle seeing her cry like that. Makes me feel... I don't know. Helpless, I guess. \n\nBut I get what you're saying. She's been carrying this alone while I've been hiding in the garage or staring at the TV. Maybe that's why she looks so tired all the time.",
  "system18": "Tired from carrying it alone - that's exactly it.\n\nHelpless is just another feeling to sit with. You handled worse in the cockpit. This time you're not saving her, you're just not leaving her to carry it by herself.\n\nTry again tomorrow. Same doorway, same living room. One sentence.",
  "user18": "Yeah. One sentence. \n\nI'll try again tomorrow. Maybe catch her before dinner when the kids aren't around. \n\nThanks for... thanks for not letting me off the hook on this.",
  "system19": "Good. Before dinner, kids occupied, just you two.\n\nOne sentence is enough. You know where to find me when you need to report back.",
  "user19": "I'll let you know how it goes. \n\nHeading to bed now. Trying to keep my mind quiet, but it's racing. Keep thinking about tomorrow, about what I'll say. \n\nNight."
