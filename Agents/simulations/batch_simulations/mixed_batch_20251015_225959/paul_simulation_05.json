  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your medicine journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I'm here because Heroic Hearts thinks this plant stuff might help me sleep through the night. That's it. Amanda says I wake up shouting sometimes and it's... it's getting to her. Been married fifteen years, never had problems like this before.\n\nI don't buy into all this spiritual mumbo-jumbo, but these guys seem legit. Military guys running it, they get it. Figure I got nothing left to lose at this point.",
  "system1": "Sleep through the night, stop shouting, save your marriage. That's what's at stake here.\n\nThe military guys running Heroic Hearts - they know what it's like when your body won't stand down. When your nervous system stays on patrol even when you're home.\n\nWhat happens when you do wake up shouting? What does Amanda do?",
  "user1": "She... she just lies there real still. Sometimes she reaches over and touches my arm, but I can feel her tense up. Like she's scared I might swing or something. Never would, never. But I can see it in her eyes - this look like she doesn't know who she's sleeping next to anymore.\n\nMost nights I just sit up and I'm... I'm back there. The smells, the sounds, all of it. Takes me a minute to remember I'm in Toledo, not... not where I was. By then she's awake and I can't... I can't look at her. Just stare at the ceiling until she falls back asleep.\n\nShe used to ask what I was dreaming about. Don't ask anymore.",
  "system2": "You're back there in Toledo, she's scared of who you might become, and the dreams have built a wall between you two.\n\nFifteen years of marriage, and now you're strangers in the dark together.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night beside her, what would be different? Beyond just the sleep itself - what changes in how you two connect?",
  "user2": "...I don't know. Maybe we'd... maybe I could just roll over and put my arm around her like I used to. Not have her flinch when I move. She used to sleep with her head on my chest, you know? Now she's all the way on her side of the bed, like she's making space for something bad to happen between us.\n\nIf I could just... if I could wake up and not feel like I need to jump out of bed and check every room in the house. Maybe ask her how she slept, like a normal person. Maybe she'd look at me the way she used to - like I was her husband, not some... not some problem she has to manage.\n\nI miss just... lying there in the morning, talking about stupid stuff. What the kids have going on, what we're doing that weekend. Now I'm up before the sun, running or working or... anything to not be in that bed anymore.",
  "system3": "Three threads here:\n\n1. Finding peace from the nightmares so Amanda can sleep next to you without flinching\n2. Teaching your body you're home in Toledo, not back there - no more jumping out of bed to clear rooms\n3. Reclaiming those morning conversations, being present enough to talk about weekend plans instead of escaping before dawn\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that's about right. I mean, I don't know how to say it all fancy, but you've got the main pieces there. \n\nJust... how do you even put something like that into words? Like, \"I want to stop being a damn nightmare to live with\" doesn't sound right. But that's what it comes down to. I want to be someone Amanda isn't afraid to sleep next to. Someone who can just... be normal again.",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together without fear\n2. I teach my body I'm home in Toledo, not back there - no more clearing rooms at dawn\n3. I reclaim being present enough for morning conversations about weekend plans\n\nThe language is yours - \"be normal again\" becomes \"reclaim being present.\" \"Stop being a nightmare\" becomes \"welcome peaceful sleep.\"\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust anything?",
  "user4": "The second one... about teaching my body I'm home in Toledo. That one hits different. Been trying to tell myself that for years - \"you're home, you're safe\" - but my body just doesn't listen. Still jumps at loud noises, still needs to know where every exit is, still can't sit with my back to a door.\n\nI like how you put it though. Simple. Direct. Not all flowery.\n\nThe peaceful sleep one... I guess that makes sense. Though \"welcome\" feels a bit soft. Like I'm inviting the nightmares to tea or something.\n\nAnd the morning conversations... yeah. I want that back. Want to be the guy who remembers what the kids have going on, asks about her day. Instead of the guy who's already halfway out the door before she opens her eyes.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I teach my body I'm home in Toledo, not back there - no more clearing rooms at dawn\"\n\nFor the sleep one - what would feel less like inviting nightmares to tea? What do you actually want to happen when you close your eyes at night?\n\nAnd the morning conversations - that one's about being the husband who stays present, not the guy planning his escape route.",
  "user5": "When I close my eyes... I just want to sleep. Like a normal person. No dreams about... about any of it. Just quiet. Black. Nothing. Wake up when the alarm goes off, not when my own voice is shouting me awake.\n\nFor the morning thing... yeah. I want to be the husband who knows what's happening with his family. Who Amanda can count on to remember that Emma has volleyball practice or that Jake needs help with his science project. Not the guy who's already planning his run route or checking the locks again.\n\nHow about... \"I sleep through the night without the dreams\" and \"I stay present for my family's mornings\"?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I sleep through the night without the dreams\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I stay present for my family's mornings\"\n\nYour three intentions:\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams\n2. I teach my body I'm home in Toledo, not back there - no more clearing rooms at dawn  \n3. I stay present for my family's mornings\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet with your military ID\n- Read them during your morning routine before the kids wake up\n- Tape them inside your gym bag where you'll see them\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the nights get rough?",
  "user6": "The wallet thing... yeah. I like that. Been carrying my military ID for twenty years now - it's always on me. These intentions... they're like orders, I guess. Something to follow. Something to keep close.\n\nMaybe write them on something tough. Not some flimsy paper that'll fall apart. Something that can handle being carried every day, pulled out when I need to remember what I'm fighting for.\n\n'Cause that's what this is, right? Another mission. Just... different terrain.",
  "system7": "Your three intentions on a card in your wallet with your military ID:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams\n2. I teach my body I'm home in Toledo, not back there - no more clearing rooms at dawn  \n3. I stay present for my family's mornings\n\nYour ritual: Keep them on something tough that can handle daily carry, pulled out when you need to remember what you're fighting for.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your mission parameters.",
  "user7": "Three weeks. Yeah. I can do three weeks.\n\n[long pause]\n\nJust... thank you. For not making me feel like I'm broken for needing this. For helping me figure out how to say what I need without it all sounding weak.\n\nI'll carry these. Every day. When the nights get bad, when Amanda's sleeping with one eye open... I'll pull them out and remember why I'm doing this. Not for me. For her. For the kids. For what we used to have before I brought the war home with me.\n\nGuess it's time to see if this plant medicine stuff can do what fifteen years of stubbornness couldn't.",
  "system8": "You're carrying these for them, but you're the one who has to walk through it. The medicine works when you're honest about what you need - and you were straight about that.\n\nThree weeks. Hold your intentions. Trust what comes.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I hear you.\n\nThree weeks. I'll be ready.",

Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user17": "Look, Heroic Hearts says this might help me stop waking up screaming every night. Amanda's about had it\u2014says she doesn't know who I am anymore. I've got three weeks before I head to Costa Rica for this ayahuasca thing. Never done anything like this before.",
  "system18": "Three weeks before Costa Rica. Amanda doesn't recognize you anymore. The screaming at night is wearing everything down.\n\nWhat happens when you wake up screaming - what do you see or remember in those moments?",
  "user18": "I don't remember much. Just... noise. Explosions. Sometimes I'm back in the cockpit, sometimes I'm watching guys I knew go down. It's like my brain's trying to rewrite history but keeps fucking it up. Amanda says I thrash around, sometimes I'm shouting coordinates or calling out names. \n\nI just want it to stop. I want to sleep through the night without her having to sleep in the guest room because she's scared I'll hurt her.",
  "system19": "Your brain's replaying those moments - cockpit, coordinates, names - while Amanda sleeps in the guest room for safety.\n\nWhen the explosions finally quiet down, what do you want to replace them with? What would peaceful sleep give you back beyond just the rest?",
  "user19": "I don't know. Never really thought about it like that. Just want the noise to stop, I guess. \n\nIf I could actually sleep... maybe Amanda wouldn't look at me like I'm some kind of ghost. Maybe I could be the guy she married again instead of this... whatever I've become. Maybe I could stop feeling like I'm about to snap all the time."
