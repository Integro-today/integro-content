## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_4**: Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Headed to Costa Rica in three weeks. Amanda thinks this'll help. I dont know.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Heroic Hearts, Costa Rica in three weeks. Amanda believes in this when you're not sure.

Three weeks isn't much time to prepare. What are you hoping shifts between you two - or inside you - that makes her think this'll help?


**paul_persona_4**: She says I wake her up screaming. Says Im not there anymore even when Im right next to her. Wants me to stop snapping at the kids. Guess she thinks this plant stuff will bring me back.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Night terrors pulling you both from sleep, feeling absent even when you're right there, snapping at the kids. Amanda's watching you disappear while you're still physically present.

What does "coming back" look like to you? When you imagine being present again - what changes with Amanda, with the kids, inside your own body?


**paul_persona_4**: I dont know man. Just... not feeling like I gotta watch every exit all the time. Maybe sitting through dinner without feeling like I need to leave. Amanda looking at me without that worried look. Kids not jumping when I raise my voice.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three clear pieces: stop scanning every exit, sit through dinner without fleeing, see Amanda's face without worry, kids not flinching when you speak.

What's underneath the constant scanning? What part of you still believes you need to watch every door?


**paul_persona_4**: Look... its just how it is. Cockpit training. Always know your exits, threats, whats coming. Doesnt turn off just cause Im home.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Cockpit training - always know your exits, threats, what's coming. Your body learned survival that doesn't switch off just because the location changed.

When you're home with Amanda and the kids, what would feel safe enough to let that vigilance rest for even five minutes?


**paul_persona_4**: I dont know. Maybe if I could sleep through one damn night without waking up shouting. Maybe if the house wasnt so quiet. Maybe if... I dont know.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Sleep through one night without shouting, the house less quiet, something else you can't name.

Three threads I'm hearing:
- Finding rest from the night terrors so you and Amanda can both sleep
- Teaching your body that home isn't a cockpit - no threats to scan for here
- Being present with your family instead of always half-watching for danger

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. That about sums it up.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together without interruption
2. I release the cockpit vigilance, teaching my body I'm home now, not in a warzone
3. I embrace being fully present with my family without scanning for threats

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**paul_persona_4**: Number 1. Just... dont make it so fancy. "I want to sleep through the night so Amanda stops getting scared." Thats it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I want to sleep through the night so Amanda stops getting scared"

How about number 2 - "release the cockpit vigilance" - does that land or need different words?


**paul_persona_4**: "Release" sounds like therapy talk. Just... I want to stop checking the doors every five minutes. Want to sit on the couch without counting who’s in the room.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I want to stop checking the doors every five minutes. I want to sit on the couch without counting who's in the room"

And number 3 - being present with your family instead of scanning for threats - how does that one land?


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. Just want to look at my kids without thinking about what could go wrong. Want Amanda to see me looking at her, not past her.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I want to look at my kids without thinking about what could go wrong. I want Amanda to see me looking at her, not past her"

Three solid intentions locked in. How do you want to keep these close when things get hard? Some options:

Keep them written where you see your flight gear
Read them during your pre-flight routine (even though you're grounded now)
Keep a card in your wallet next to your ID

What would help you remember these when the vigilance kicks in?


**paul_persona_4**: Wallet card. I see my ID every time I grab it. Thats where they should be.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I want to sleep through the night so Amanda stops getting scared
- I want to stop checking the doors every five minutes. I want to sit on the couch without counting who's in the room  
- I want to look at my kids without thinking about what could go wrong. I want Amanda to see me looking at her, not past her

Your ritual: Wallet card next to your ID. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.


**paul_persona_4**: Got it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. Wondering what happens if it doesn't work.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's real. Sometimes the medicine shows us what we need, not what we want. The intentions still matter - they give direction even if the path looks different than expected. 

What's underneath the worry about it not working?


**paul_persona_4**: Then Amanda leaves. And I dont get to fix it with the kids.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Amanda leaving, losing the kids - that's the stakes. The medicine might not give you the exact fix you're hoping for, but intentions work even when outcomes shift. They keep you pointed toward what matters most.

What would staying connected to your kids look like, even if Amanda's not in the house?


**paul_persona_4**: I dont know. Havent let myself think about that. Too much.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Too much to even picture. That's the edge - where you're standing right now.

Let's stay with the intentions we built. They're built for exactly this moment - when the stakes feel impossible and you can't see past the next step. Hold them. Trust what comes.


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. Just feels like a lot riding on some weird plant stuff.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Weird plant stuff carrying everything that matters. That's heavy.

The intentions aren't magic words - they're your anchor when the weird plant stuff gets weirder. Three clear directions you chose yourself, not something handed to you.

You've done your part. Now the medicine does its part.


**paul_persona_4**: I guess. Just want to come back and not be... like this anymore.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Not like this - jumping at shadows, sleeping alone, watching Amanda flinch. That's what you're carrying to the medicine.

These intentions we built aren't about fixing you. They're about giving you something solid to hold when everything feels like it's slipping. You've got three weeks. Keep them close.


**paul_persona_4**: Yeah. Just tired of being tired.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tired of being tired - that's the bottom. Nothing left to prove, just need something different.

Three intentions. One anchor. That's enough for now.


**paul_persona_4**: I guess.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's enough. 

Your compass is set. Let the medicine meet you where you are.


**paul_persona_4**: Alright.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your psychedelic journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_4**: Amanda says I need help. Wakes me up when I'm screaming. Says she can't take much more of this.
