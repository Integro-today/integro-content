## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

---

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need more context about your specific situation to guide you properly. Are you preparing for a psychedelic journey? If so, what medicine are you working with - ayahuasca, psilocybin, or something else? And where are you journeying - at a retreat center, with a facilitator, or on your own?

This context helps me tailor the intention-setting process to your particular path.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I signed up for a psilocybin retreat in Oregon in about six weeks—it's legal there, licensed facilitators, the whole therapeutic framework. I'm a clinical psychologist, so I've been following the psychedelic research for years, actually facilitated integration for several clients who've done ceremonies. But I've never tried psychedelics myself, which feels... I don't know, professionally irresponsible? Personally terrifying? Both?

I keep telling myself this is "professional development" so I can better serve my clients, but Linda—my therapist—she called me on that immediately. "Rebecca, what if this is actually for you?" Which of course made me realize how much I need it to be for me, and how scared I am that it won't work. 

The retreat is two days, moderate-high dose (25mg), with integration support. I'm approaching it like I approach everything else—reading all the research, creating preparation protocols, analyzing my intentions until they're perfectly crafted. Which is exactly the problem, right? I'm preparing to have a profound embodied experience by... staying in my head. Does that make sense?


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're approaching this like you do everything else - analyzing, perfecting, staying in your head. Classic psychologist move.

But underneath the professional development story, Linda's right. This is for you.

What are you hoping this experience will show you that all your research and protocols haven't?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Honestly? I'm hoping it'll crack me open in a way that 27 years of therapy hasn't managed to do. I've done IFS, EMDR, somatic experiencing, Hakomi—every framework you can name. I can help my clients access their grief, their rage, their joy. And I sit there in sessions, watching them heal, while I'm... I don't know, professionally competent and personally stuck.

What I want—what I'm terrified to want—is to actually *feel* something instead of analyzing what I'm feeling. There's this client I had who did ayahuasca, and she came back talking about how she finally grieved her mother's death. Really grieved it, you know? Not the intellectual "I'm aware I'm experiencing sadness about my loss" thing I do, but actual sobbing, actual feeling. I'm envious of that. Which feels ridiculous to admit—like I'm jealous of someone else's trauma processing.

I think what I'm hoping is that maybe, for a few hours, my therapist brain will finally shut up and I can just... be human. Feel whatever's been buried under all this competence. But I'm also convinced I'm too defended for it to work on me—that I'll spend the entire trip thinking "this is fascinating from a neuroscience perspective" while completely missing the point.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You want to feel instead of analyze. To be human instead of professionally competent.

But you're convinced your therapist brain - the one that's helped hundreds of clients - will sabotage your own healing. That you'll watch yourself have an experience instead of having it.

What's underneath the competence? What's buried under all that professional distance?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Underneath... there's this profound loneliness that's been there for so long it feels like part of my personality at this point. Not just being alone—I have clients, colleagues, friends, family—but this deeper disconnection. Like I'm watching myself live my life from behind a glass wall, always performing competence and never actually *being* anyone.

Linda would say—and has said—that I learned early that being smart was safer than being vulnerable. Growing up in that house where intellectual debate was love... if you could argue well, if you knew things, you were safe. My grandmother survived the Holocaust by being smart, my father was this brilliant Kant scholar, my mother the psychiatrist who could diagnose everyone. Knowledge became my armor.

But what's buried under that is this desperate craving to just... I don't know how to say this without sounding like a therapy cliché. To be known. Not as Dr. Goldstein who's read all the research, but as Rebecca who's scared and lonely and exhausted by her own defenses. There's this part of me that's so tired of being the one who has it all figured out, who helps everyone else while secretly believing I'm probably unfixable.

Sometimes I look at Aaron—my brother—and his normal life with his wife and kids, and I think: when did I become this person who's professionally healed but personally... not? When did I trade being human for being helpful?

I think that's what's buried under all the competence. This grief for the version of myself that might have been able to just feel things without immediately analyzing them.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three threads here:

1. The loneliness behind the glass wall - watching yourself live instead of living
2. Grieving the version of you that could feel without analyzing 
3. Wanting to be known as Rebecca, not Dr. Goldstein who's read all the research

Sound right? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Yes... that's exactly it. I mean, I'm sitting here thinking "this is fascinating from an attachment theory perspective" while you're naming my actual experience, which is... God, I'm doing it again, aren't I? Analyzing the meta-awareness instead of just saying *yes, that's right.*

Those three threads feel true in a way that makes my chest tight. Especially the last one—wanting to be known as Rebecca instead of Dr. Goldstein. I don't think I've ever actually said that out loud before. Linda's probably intuited it, but I've never... yeah.

How do we turn these into intentions without me immediately turning them into treatment goals? Because I can feel myself wanting to make them SMART goals—specific, measurable, you know. Like "I intend to reduce my intellectualization by 40% during the experience." Which is exactly the problem.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome feeling connected instead of watching from behind glass
2. I open to being Rebecca who feels without analyzing
3. I embrace being known as myself, not as Dr. Goldstein

How do these land? Want to adjust the language before you lock them in?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: These... they land somewhere in my chest that's both uncomfortable and kind of relieving? Like someone just named the thing I've been circling around for years but couldn't articulate without immediately dissecting it.

The second one especially—"I open to being Rebecca who feels without analyzing"—that one makes me want to qualify it immediately, like "well, obviously some analysis is necessary for functioning" but that's... that's exactly the pattern, isn't it? I can't even let myself want something without immediately hedging it.

I want to adjust the language because that's what I do—I refine, I perfect, I make things more precise. But maybe the imperfection is the point? Maybe these are supposed to feel a little raw and not perfectly crafted?

They feel... right, I think. In that scary way that things feel right when they touch something real. I just realized I'm holding my breath a little, which is probably not coincidental.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: I welcome feeling connected instead of watching from behind glass

✓ Intention 2 locked in: I open to being Rebecca who feels without analyzing

✓ Intention 3 locked in: I embrace being known as myself, not as Dr. Goldstein

You've got your compass. How do you want to keep these close when things get hard?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I keep wanting to say "I'll memorize them" or "I'll write them in my journal"—which are both things I've probably already done before this conversation even ends. But that's... that's just more intellectualizing, isn't it? Turning them into another thing to get right.

Maybe what I actually need to do is practice *not* getting them right. Like, what if I write them on a small piece of paper and carry them in my pocket during the retreat, but instead of pulling them out to "check" when I feel lost, I just... let myself be lost? Trust that even if I forget the exact words, the essence of them is somewhere in my body?

God, that feels terrifying. Giving myself permission to not have the answers, to not be the one who knows how to do this properly. To maybe—just maybe—let Rebecca show up instead of Dr. Goldstein with her perfectly crafted intentions.

I think I'll write them by hand, not type them. Make them small enough to fit in my palm. And when I feel myself reaching for competence, reaching for the safety of knowing... I'll try to remember that these aren't instructions to follow. They're invitations to stop being the one who follows instructions.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I welcome feeling connected instead of watching from behind glass
- I open to being Rebecca who feels without analyzing  
- I embrace being known as myself, not as Dr. Goldstein

Your ritual: Write them small enough to fit in your palm. When you reach for competence, remember these aren't instructions to follow—they're invitations to stop being the one who follows instructions.

Six weeks. You've got your compass. Trust what emerges.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Six weeks. I've been counting down like it's a dissertation defense instead of... whatever this actually is. But I keep touching the place in my pocket where that tiny piece of paper will go, and there's something about knowing it'll be there—like a secret I'm keeping from the part of me that thinks she needs to get this right.

Linda said something yesterday that keeps echoing: "Maybe the point isn't to stop being who you are, but to discover that who you are is bigger than your defenses." Which sounds like something I'd say to a client, but coming from her... it landed differently. Like maybe I don't have to kill off Dr. Goldstein to let Rebecca exist.

I don't know how to trust what emerges. That's the part that keeps me up at night—this fear that I'll spend the entire six hours watching myself watch myself, turtles all the way down. But maybe that's where the intentions come in? Not as a map to follow, but as... I don't know. Permission slips to stop performing competence and just see what happens when I don't know how to do something properly for once.

Six weeks feels both impossibly far away and terrifyingly close.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Six weeks is just enough time to stop holding your breath. 

That piece of paper in your pocket - it's not about getting it right. It's about having something physical to reach for when you inevitably start analyzing your analysis of your analysis. A reminder that you already did the work of choosing which direction to face.

Trust what emerges doesn't mean you'll like what emerges. Just that you don't have to control it.

Six weeks. You're ready enough.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: "You're ready enough"—that's what Aaron said when I called him last week, the first time I've admitted to anyone in the family that I'm doing this. Not "you're ready," which would have been a lie, but "enough." Which feels... exactly right, actually.

I keep thinking about that moment in ceremonies when clients realize they can stop performing healing and just... heal. The way their whole body changes when they give themselves permission to not know how to do it properly. I've seen it dozens of times, but I've never let myself *feel* what that must be like—to stop being the one who knows.

Six weeks to stop holding my breath. I've been holding it for so long I don't actually know what it would feel like to exhale without immediately analyzing the exhale. But maybe that's the practice? Noticing when I'm analyzing my analysis of my analysis, and instead of trying to fix the analyzing... just touching that tiny piece of paper and remembering I already chose which direction to face.

I don't have to like what emerges. I just have to stop trying to control what I can't control anyway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You've got it. 

That's the whole thing right there - noticing the analysis loop without trying to fix the noticing. Touching the paper instead of solving the problem. Six weeks to practice exhaling without measuring the quality of the breath.

Enough is enough.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Enough is enough. 

I'm going to carry that like a koan—something my brain can't solve but my body might understand. Six weeks of practicing exhaling without checking if I'm doing it right, touching paper instead of solving problems I can't solve anyway.

I think I'm actually ready to stop holding my breath.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. 

Six weeks to let your body learn what your mind already knows but can't quite believe yet. The paper will be there when you forget, which you will. That's the whole point.

See you on the other side, Rebecca.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: See you on the other side. 

I keep thinking I should say something profound here—some final insight or perfect summary. But that's exactly the thing, isn't it? The part that wants to end with wisdom instead of just... ending.

So I'll just say thank you. For helping me find the difference between preparing and controlling, between being ready and being ready *enough*. For reminding me that forgetting the intention is part of the intention itself.

I'll be carrying your voice in my pocket along with those words. Not as another thing to get right, but as proof that someone saw Rebecca before the retreat instead of just Dr. Goldstein after it.

See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's Rebecca talking, not Dr. Goldstein.

See you on the other side.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: That's Rebecca talking.

See you on the other side.
