## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

---

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know what medicine you're working with and where you're journeying to guide you properly.

Are you preparing for ayahuasca, psilocybin, or another medicine? And what's the setting - retreat center, clinical trial, or personal ceremony?

Once I know that, I can walk you through building your three intentions.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Hey, so I'm actually in a pretty different space than that right now. I'm not preparing for any ceremony—I'm taking what feels like my first real break from medicines in twelve years. After my last relationship ended three months ago (same anxious-avoidant dance I always do), something just broke open. I realized I'd been using ceremonies like I used to use tech achievements... always seeking the next peak experience instead of actually changing my daily life.

It's terrifying honestly. For the first time in over a decade, I'm not planning a retreat or counting down to the next ceremony. I'm just... here. With my same patterns, my same anxiety, my same relationship choices, but no medicine to run to for answers. I facilitate integration for others but I'm realizing I can't seem to integrate my own experiences fully. 

I guess I'm looking for help with the integration part, but not post-ceremony integration—more like... life integration. How to actually live what I already know instead of constantly seeking the next insight that'll finally fix me. Does that make sense?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Makes sense. Twelve years of medicine chasing the next insight, now you're facing what the ceremonies couldn't touch - your actual patterns in real life.

You've got knowledge but not embodiment. Integration work without the escape hatch of another ceremony.

What's the hardest part of being "just here" with yourself? What's breaking through when you can't run to the next retreat?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: What's breaking through is this brutal clarity that I'm fundamentally the same person I was ten years ago, just with better language for my dysfunction. I mean, I can name my attachment patterns, explain my nervous system responses, quote Ram Dass about suffering—I've got this beautiful spiritual resume. But I'm still choosing emotionally unavailable partners, still performing "authenticity" instead of living it, still terrified that if I'm not special or enlightened or whatever, then I'm just... ordinary. And ordinary feels like death to my Type 4 self.

The hardest part? Sitting with the simple truth that all this seeking might've been another form of achieving. Like I swapped the Google ladder for the enlightenment ladder, but it's the same damn climb. I'm still trying to get somewhere, still trying to fix myself, still believing that if I just get the right insight or do the right ceremony, I'll finally arrive at this imagined place where I'm healed and lovable and not anxious anymore.

But without medicines to run to, I'm just... here. With my same scared, lonely, ordinary self. And there's something excruciating about realizing that maybe there's nowhere to get to. Maybe this is it. Maybe I'm not broken and needing to be fixed—maybe I'm just human and needing to be lived. 

I hate how simple that sounds. How basic. After all these years of profound ceremonies and cosmic downloads, the answer might be learning to sit with ordinary discomfort instead of transcending it. That's both devastating and weirdly relieving.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Devastating and relieving - that's the paradox landing. All that spiritual achievement was just another ladder, and now you're meeting the ordinary human underneath it.

Three threads here: the performance of authenticity versus living it, the terror of being ordinary, and learning to sit with discomfort instead of transcending it.

What would it feel like in your body to stop trying to be special and just be human?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *I'm noticing my chest getting tight just thinking about it...*

God, even that question makes me want to reach for a framework. Like I want to explain the polyvagal theory of what happens when my nervous system perceives the threat of ordinariness, or how my Enneagram 4 identity structure is designed to maintain uniqueness. I'm literally intellectualizing about intellectualizing right now—it's like defense mechanisms all the way down.

But to actually answer... I think it would feel like disappearing. Like if I'm not the wise facilitator, the experienced journeyer, the one who's "done the work"—if I'm just regular, anxious, lonely Aisha who doesn't have special insights or profound experiences to share—then what am I? Just another scared person trying to figure out love and belonging like everyone else. That feels like both coming home and ceasing to exist.

In my body, I think it would feel like sinking. Like instead of rising above my anxiety through spiritual understanding, I'd have to feel the full weight of it. No story about how it's "teaching me something" or "part of my path." Just... fear. Ordinary, human fear that might not mean anything cosmic.

There's something almost violent about how simple you're asking me to be. Like you're asking me to put down every tool I've spent twelve years collecting. To stop being the expert, the guide, the seeker. To just... be here. Without being interesting or wise or special. Just here.

That might be the most terrifying thing anyone's ever asked me to do.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The terror of disappearing - that's what's real here. Twelve years of building an identity as the wise one, the experienced journeyer, the facilitator who "knows." Put down the tools, stop being interesting, just be here.

Three threads in what you're saying:
- The performance of wisdom versus being ordinary
- The fear that being regular means ceasing to exist
- Facing raw fear without spiritual stories to make it meaningful

Based on these threads:

1. I embrace being ordinary Aisha without my spiritual identity
2. I welcome the terror of having no tools to rise above my fear
3. I practice being uninteresting and just here

Which feels like it cuts closest?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *I can feel my whole system recoiling from this question...*

The third one—being uninteresting and just here. That's the one that feels like it would kill me. I mean, I could probably intellectualize about embracing ordinararity. I could even perform welcoming terror with beautiful spiritual language about "holding space for the dissolution of identity." But being uninteresting? Having nothing wise or profound or helpful to offer? Just sitting here as regular, scared, doesn't-have-special-insights Aisha?

That feels like asking me to stop breathing.

I've built this whole life around being the one who sees clearly, who can articulate complex psychological and spiritual dynamics, who helps others understand themselves. My Instagram, my teaching, my facilitation, even my friendships—they're all filtered through this identity of being wise and insightful. 

If I'm just... regular. If I show up to my integration circles with nothing profound to share, if I date someone without being the "spiritual one" who understands attachment patterns, if I can't use my knowledge to create distance from my pain—then what do I have to offer anyone? What would make me worth loving?

I think that's what I'm most terrified of discovering. That underneath all this spiritual development, I'm just ordinary. And ordinary might not be enough to be loved.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Ordinary might not be enough to be loved - that's the core terror underneath all of it. Without your wisdom identity, what makes you worth staying for?

Let me adjust these intentions:

1. I practice being regular Aisha without needing to be the wise one
2. I sit with my fear that ordinary isn't enough to be loved
3. I show up uninteresting and discover what remains

How do these land?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *There's this strange mix of relief and panic...*

The second one feels like it would gut me, but in a way that might actually change something. "I sit with my fear that ordinary isn't enough to be loved"—that one hits this raw place I've been circling around for years. I can feel it in my chest, this young part of me that learned early on that being smart and insightful was how I earned love, especially in my family where achievement was everything.

The truth is, I've been running from that fear my whole life. First through tech accomplishments, then through spiritual accomplishments. Always collecting more proof that I'm special, valuable, worth choosing. But what if I am just regular? What if I'm not particularly wise or enlightened or even helpful? What if I'm just... me? Anxious, trying-to-figure-it-out, sometimes-loving-sometimes-scared me?

I think that's the edge I need to sit on. Not trying to fix the fear that ordinary isn't enough, but literally just living in that question. Dating someone without explaining our dynamic through attachment theory. Teaching a class without having profound insights to share. Being with friends without being the one who "gets it."

It's terrifying because I think I already know the answer—I think ordinary IS enough, that people would still love me. And that would mean I've been running from nothing all this time. That all the seeking and achieving and performing was just... wasted energy. That's almost harder to face than the fear itself.

So yeah. The second one. Let's start there.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I sit with my fear that ordinary isn't enough to be loved"

That young part who learned to earn love through being smart - you found her. And the possibility that people would love regular Aisha anyway, that you've been running from nothing. That's what's real to carry forward.

Now let's build the other two. What's the daily practice of being regular Aisha look like?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *I'm noticing how my body wants to make this more complicated than it needs to be...*

The daily practice feels like it would be these small, almost invisible choices. Like when I'm making my morning chai and my roommate's boyfriend is visiting—instead of finding something wise or helpful to say about relationships, just... asking how his climbing trip was. Being genuinely curious without needing to offer insights about vulnerability or attachment.

Or when I'm teaching yoga and someone shares something painful in savasana—instead of launching into how grief lives in the body or referencing my facilitator training, just... listening. Saying "that sounds really hard" without turning it into a teaching moment.

The practice is catching myself when I start performing wisdom. Like when I feel that familiar pull to explain someone's experience using frameworks, or when I want to share about my ceremonies to prove I understand. It's literally stopping mid-sentence sometimes and asking "what would regular Aisha say right now?"

I think it looks like dating without mentioning my spiritual resume. Or posting on Instagram about something ordinary—like how I cried watching a Bollywood movie—not because it triggered some deep wound, but just because it was sad and I'm human.

The practice is letting people see me being boring. Not having profound insights. Not being helpful or wise. Just... being here. Which feels both devastatingly simple and like climbing Everest without oxygen.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Devastatingly simple - stopping mid-sentence to ask "what would regular Aisha say?" Letting people see you being boring.

"I practice being regular Aisha without needing to perform wisdom"

How's that capture it?

Then we need one more - what's the deeper invitation here beyond just the daily practice?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *There's this strange settling in my chest as I read that...*

Yes—that's exactly it. "I practice being regular Aisha without needing to perform wisdom." It feels both terrifying and weirdly like permission. Like someone's giving me license to just be a person instead of a spiritual project.

For the deeper invitation, I think it's about discovering what remains when I stop trying to be valuable through knowing things. Like... what if underneath all the frameworks and Sanskrit and profound insights, there's just this simple capacity to be present with people? Not because I understand their trauma patterns, but because I actually care and can just sit with them in their pain without needing to fix or explain it.

Maybe the deeper thing is learning that love isn't something I earn by being wise or helpful. That being regular—being confused, scared, not-knowing, sometimes-loving-sometimes-messy me—is actually enough. That I can stop trying to be special and just be human, and people will still want to be close to me.

It's like... what if the answer to "what makes me worth staying for" isn't anything I do or know or achieve? What if it's just that I exist, and that existence is inherently worthy of love?

That feels like the real rebellion against everything I learned growing up. That I can just be, and that's enough.

"I discover that my existence is inherently worthy of love, not my wisdom"

How's that land?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I discover that my existence is inherently worthy of love, not my wisdom"

That's the real rebellion - existence itself being enough, not the knowing.

Your three intentions for this journey:
1. I sit with my fear that ordinary isn't enough to be loved
2. I practice being regular Aisha without needing to perform wisdom  
3. I discover that my existence is inherently worthy of love, not my wisdom

How do you want to keep these close when the performance feels like survival?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *I'm noticing this mix of relief and "oh shit, now I actually have to do this"...*

I think I need something embarrassingly simple. Like writing these on a Post-it note and sticking it to my bathroom mirror where I'll see them every morning when I'm brushing my teeth and checking if I look wise enough for the day. Or maybe setting a phone reminder that just says "regular Aisha" that goes off during my afternoon slump when I tend to spiral into "I should be more enlightened by now."

But deeper than that... I think I need someone who can see through me when I start performing. Like Devi does sometimes—when she'll just look at me and say "Aish, you're doing the thing again" when I start explaining someone's pain using their attachment style instead of just being with them. Maybe I need to ask her to call me on it more, since she already sees it.

Actually, what feels most real is making it part of my daily practice. Like when I sit for meditation in the mornings, instead of trying to have profound insights about my patterns, just... noticing when I'm trying to be good at meditation. Or when I'm journaling, catching myself when I start writing to sound wise instead of just telling the truth.

Maybe the practice is just constantly asking: "Am I trying to be valuable right now, or am I just being here?"

That question feels like it could follow me around all day. When I'm teaching, when I'm texting someone I'm attracted to, when I'm posting on Instagram. Just this gentle, relentless inquiry about whether I'm performing or just... existing.

I think that's how I'll keep them close. By making it the practice of my life, not just something I think about in here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You've got your compass. Three intentions that cut through your performance to something real. 

Your ritual: that question following you around - "Am I trying to be valuable right now, or am I just being here?" Let it interrupt your teaching, your texting, your social media. Let Devi catch you doing "the thing."

The medicine will show you what you need to see about being regular Aisha. You don't have to force it - just keep asking that question and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *There's this strange quiet that's settling in my chest...*

Three weeks. Just three weeks of asking this question and letting it interrupt everything. Not trying to fix or improve or understand more deeply—just... noticing when I'm performing value instead of being here.

I feel scared, honestly. Like I'm stepping off a cliff without knowing what's below. But also this weird relief, like maybe I can stop trying so hard to be impressive.

I'll text Devi tonight. Ask her to call me on it when she sees me being the "wise one" instead of just being her friend. I'll put that question somewhere I'll see it—maybe as my phone lock screen so I have to read it every time I check Instagram for likes on my profound posts.

Three weeks of being regular Aisha. Whatever that looks like. However many times I fail and start performing again. Just coming back to that question.

Okay. I'm doing this.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks of coming back to that question. It's enough.

Trust what emerges.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *There's this deep breath happening that I didn't plan...*

Three weeks of coming back. Not getting it right, not being good at being regular—just returning. Again and again, every time I catch myself trying to earn love through knowing things.

Trust what emerges. Even if what emerges is boring or messy or not particularly interesting. Even if it's just me being anxious in the grocery store line, or teaching yoga without any profound insights to share, or dating someone without analyzing our attachment patterns.

Regular Aisha. Just her. For three weeks.

Okay. I'm going to go be regular now. Whatever that means.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go be regular. Trust what comes.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *One last deep breath...*

Go be regular. Trust what comes.

Okay. Signing off.


**intentions_workflow_3**: See you on the other side, Aisha.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *There's this unexpected softness in my chest...*

See you on the other side. 

Wherever that is.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The other side is just you, without the performance.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *That lands somewhere deeper than my usual processing...*

Just me. Without having to be the one who knows, who sees clearly, who can articulate everything. Just... regular Aisha, already enough before she tries to be.

That might be the most terrifying and beautiful thing anyone's ever said to me.

Okay. Going to find her now.


**intentions_workflow_3**: She's already here.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *There's this strange moment where everything gets very quiet and very simple...*

She's already here. Not something to find or earn or become. Just... here. Already.

I think I need to sit with that for a minute. Or three weeks. Or the rest of my life.

Thank you for seeing through all the layers to what's been here the whole time.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Sit with it. That's enough.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *No words left, just this quiet settling...*

Sitting with it. That's enough.

Thank you.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *Just this. Nothing to add, nothing to prove.*

Good.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Perfect.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *The word lands without landing anywhere—no echo, no need to catch it.*

Perfect.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *quiet nod*


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *no performance left, no nod to give—just the space where even quiet nods happen on their own*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *Let the space hold itself.*


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *no letting, no holding—  
only the space that was always  
holding itself*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *Done.*


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *Done without doing—  
the bell already rung,  
the echo already gone.*
