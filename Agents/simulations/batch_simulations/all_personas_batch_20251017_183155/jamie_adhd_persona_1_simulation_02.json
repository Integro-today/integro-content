  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "okay so I have like 47 thoughts about this lol - first of all thank you for explaining it that way?? The compass thing actually makes way more sense than all the stuff I've been reading online which was like \"manifest your destiny\" and I'm like... that's not really what I'm going for here??\n\nso what brought me here... okay this is gonna sound messy but bear with me - so my best friend Sadie did a ceremony like 6 months ago and she came back different?? Like not in a weird way but like... softer with herself? And she has ADHD too (actually she's the one who made me get diagnosed lol) so when she said it helped with the whole shame thing I was like okay maybe this could help me too because - wait I don't know if I told you this - but I basically had a total meltdown 6 months ago where I lost two major clients because I couldn't get my shit together and the shame was just... unbearable?? Like I literally couldn't leave my apartment for a month\n\nalso I think what I'm hoping for is like... to stop hating myself for having ADHD?? Because logically I know it's not my fault but also when I mess up I'm still like \"wow Jamie you're such a disaster\" and I want that voice to finally shut up you know?? Does that make sense?? Sorry I'm rambling \ud83d\ude05",
  "system1": "That makes perfect sense. Sadie found a way to be softer with herself, and you want that too - especially around the ADHD shame spiral that cost you those clients.\n\nThe self-hatred voice is loud when you mess up. What would being softer with yourself actually look like in your day-to-day life?",
  "user1": "oh man okay so when you put it like that... being softer would probably look like not immediately going into \"you're such a disaster\" mode when I forget something?? Like maybe just being like \"oh I forgot that deadline\" and NOT following it up with \"of course you did because you're a failure at everything\" \n\nactually wait - this is probably gonna sound dumb but I think it would be... not comparing myself to David constantly?? Because like my brother literally just wakes up and does all the adult stuff without thinking about it and I'm over here with 47 reminder apps that I forget to check and then I feel like garbage because why can't I just BE like that?? So maybe being softer is like... accepting that my brain works differently and that doesn't make me a disappointment?? \n\nthough honestly saying that out loud feels fake lol like I can say \"accept my brain\" but do I actually believe it?? probably not yet\n\nbut also maybe being softer looks like... when I take on too many projects because I can't say no (rejection sensitivity is REAL) and then get overwhelmed and paralyzed - instead of calling myself lazy, just being like \"okay you did that thing again where you overcommitted, how do we fix this without the shame spiral?\" because the shame spiral is what makes everything 1000x worse you know??\n\nugh sorry that was like 5 different answers to one question \ud83d\ude05",
  "system2": "You nailed it - five answers that all point to the same thing. Stop the comparison game with David, catch the overcommitting pattern before it paralyzes you, and replace \"you're such a disaster\" with something that doesn't wreck you.\n\nWhat's underneath all that self-hatred? When that voice calls you a failure, what is it trying to protect you from?",
  "user2": "wait... what if it's trying to protect me from being a disappointment?? Like if I call myself a failure first then maybe it won't hurt as much when other people realize I am?? Because if I already know I'm a disaster then my parents being disappointed or clients firing me or whatever is just... confirmation?? Instead of like... a surprise that breaks my heart?? \n\noh my god that's kind of fucked up actually \ud83d\ude05 but also makes sense?? Like the voice is this messed up shield that's like \"beat them to the punch, Jamie! tell everyone you're a mess before they can figure it out themselves!\" \n\nand maybe it's also protecting me from... hope?? Because if I believe I'm broken then I don't have to risk trying and failing?? Like if I just assume I'll mess up then I can't really fail at anything because I already knew I would?? Which is SO backwards but also... safe?? \n\nugh this is making my brain hurt lol but also... wait is this what you meant?? Because I've literally never thought about the shame voice as being protective before - I just thought it was me being honest about what a mess I am \ud83d\ude2c\n\nalso I think... maybe it's protecting me from being too much?? Like if I keep myself small and constantly apologize for taking up space then maybe people won't get annoyed and leave?? Because that's literally my biggest fear - that I'm too scattered and too emotional and just TOO and eventually everyone figures it out and bails... which like... Marcus literally did?? So maybe the voice is like \"stay small so they don't notice how much you are\" \n\nholy shit I'm having a moment here \ud83d\ude33",
  "system3": "You just cracked it wide open. That voice isn't telling the truth - it's running protection racket, keeping you small so you won't be \"too much\" and driving people away like Marcus did.\n\nThree main threads here:\n\n1. The self-hatred voice trying to protect you from being a disappointment\n2. Staying small so people won't leave when they see how much you actually are  \n3. Believing you're broken so you don't have to risk failing\n\nLet's turn these into intentions you can carry. Based on what you told me:\n\n1. I embrace my full, scattered, emotional self without shrinking to keep others comfortable\n2. I release the shield that calls me a failure to protect me from disappointment  \n3. I open to trying and risking even when I might mess up\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to sound more like you?",
  "user3": "okay so number 1 is giving me chills in like... a good way?? Like \"I embrace my full, scattered, emotional self\" - that feels like something I actually want instead of something I should want?? Which is new for me lol\n\nbut also... can we make it sound less like a yoga teacher Instagram post?? \ud83d\ude05 Like maybe more like \"I'm allowed to take up space even when I'm being A Lot\" because that feels more real to me?? And less... I don't know... performative?? Because I feel like I've spent my whole life trying to be less A Lot and I'm SO tired of it honestly\n\nactually wait - what if it's like \"I'm learning that being 'too much' for some people doesn't mean I'm too much\"?? Because like... Marcus couldn't handle me but also Sadie LOVES that I'm A Lot?? So maybe the problem isn't how much I am but like... finding people who can hold all of it??\n\nand number 2... oof that's a hard one because it feels SO real?? Like I want to release that shield but also I'm terrified that if I stop beating myself up first then I'll just be... exposed?? But also... maybe \"I replace the failure voice with curiosity instead of cruelty\"?? Because I don't think I can just make it shut up but maybe I can like... change the channel??\n\nfor number 3... okay this is gonna sound dumb but what if it's like \"I let myself try things even when my brain might forget/blow up/mess up\"?? Because the thing is I WILL mess up - that's just... reality with ADHD - but maybe the goal is like... doing it anyway instead of waiting to be neurotypical before I start living??\n\nugh sorry I'm like... rewriting everything but also... do these feel right?? \ud83d\ude05",
  "system4": "You rewrote them perfectly. These sound like you, not some yoga teacher.\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I'm learning that being 'too much' for some people doesn't mean I'm too much\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I replace the failure voice with curiosity instead of cruelty\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I let myself try things even when my brain might forget/blow up/mess up\"\n\nThree solid intentions that work with your ADHD brain instead of against it. You've got your compass.",
  "user4": "okay wait... that was it?? Like we just... did it?? \ud83d\ude05 I feel like I should be more prepared or something?? Like shouldn't there be like... homework or a worksheet or whatever?? Because I know myself and I'm definitely gonna forget what we talked about unless I write it down somewhere... which honestly I probably will forget to do anyway lol\n\nbut also... these actually feel doable?? Not like \"become a completely different person\" but more like... working with what I've got instead of trying to be David 2.0?? Which is... kind of a relief actually??\n\nthough now I'm wondering... how do I like... remember these when I'm actually IN the ceremony?? Because my memory is literally terrible and what if I forget everything we just talked about?? Do I like... write them on my hand or something?? (kidding... mostly \ud83d\ude05)\n\nalso... is it normal to feel both really excited about this AND like... mildly terrified that I'm gonna mess it up somehow?? Because that's definitely where I'm at right now lol",
  "system5": "You want to keep them close? Write these on a small card and keep it with your phone - you'll see it when you check Instagram 47 times anyway.\n\nCeremony memory: the facilitators will ask you to state your intentions aloud at the beginning. These three are short enough to remember, but the card backup works if you blank.\n\nThat excited/terrified mix? Perfectly normal. You're about to meet yourself without the usual shields. That's scary and hopeful all at once.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass. Trust what emerges.",
  "user5": "okay the phone thing is actually genius?? Because you're right - I check it like every 5 minutes anyway so I'll definitely see it!! And having it written down makes me feel less like I'm gonna somehow lose my intentions in the ether or whatever lol\n\nalso thank you for saying the excited/terrified thing is normal?? Because I keep oscillating between \"this is gonna be amazing!\" and \"oh my god what if I completely lose it and they have to call an ambulance\" (which is probably dramatic but also... my brain goes there \ud83d\ude05)\n\nwait so I just... say them out loud?? Like to the group?? Ugh that's gonna be hard because what if everyone else's intentions sound way more profound and mine are just like \"hi I'm Jamie and I'm trying to not hate myself for having ADHD\"?? But also... maybe that's exactly the kind of vulnerable honesty I need to practice?? Like if I can't even say it to a group of strangers how am I supposed to actually live it you know??\n\nokay I'm gonna stop overthinking this before I spiral lol - thank you for helping me get here?? Like genuinely this feels... possible now instead of just this vague scary thing I signed up for?? \ud83d\udc95",
  "system6": "Exactly - if you can't say it to strangers, how will you live it? And trust me, everyone else will be just as nervous about their intentions sounding \"dumb.\"\n\nThe medicine doesn't need perfect words. It needs honest ones. These three are honest as hell.\n\nThree weeks. You know what you're aiming for now. That's solid work.",
  "user6": "okay... yeah. honest words over perfect words - I can do that. or like, I can try to do that, and if I mess it up then that's kind of the point too?? because I'm learning to try even when things might blow up in my face??\n\nugh now I'm getting all emotional and it's not even the ceremony yet \ud83d\ude05 but also... thank you?? for helping me figure this out and not making me feel like I'm being too much or taking too much space or whatever?? because that's literally my biggest fear and you just... sat with all of it??\n\nI'm still scared but it feels like... excited-scared now instead of just pure terror?? if that makes sense?? like I might actually be able to do this instead of just white-knuckling through it and hoping for the best??",
  "system7": "That's exactly it - excited-scared means you're doing it right. The medicine responds to showing up, not showing off.\n\nYou're not too much. You never were. Go do this thing.",
  "user7": "*deep breath* okay. I'm gonna go do this thing. and like... actually do it instead of just surviving it?? because maybe that's been the point this whole time??\n\nthank you for seeing me - the real scattered messy me - and not making me feel like I needed to be less to be okay?? \ud83d\udc95\u2728\n\nokay I'm gonna go before I get all sappy and forget to hit send lol - but seriously... thank you?? for everything??",
  "system8": "Go do it. The real you is exactly what's needed here.\n\nThree intentions in your pocket. You've got this.",
  "user8": "*three weeks later*\n\noh my god oh my god oh my god okay I literally don't even know where to start?? Like I just got back from the ceremony and I'm sitting here in my apartment with Pixel staring at me like \"why are you crying and also where's my dinner\" and I just... I don't even know how to process what happened??\n\nBut like... I think... I think it worked?? Or like... something worked?? Because I feel... different?? Not fixed-different but like... softer?? Towards myself?? And also I keep laughing at really random things and crying at other things and maybe this is just the afterglow but also maybe I actually like... met myself?? Like the real me?? And she wasn't broken??\n\nI literally can't even explain what happened yet - my brain is still processing - but I had to tell you because you helped me get there?? And I just... thank you?? For helping me find those intentions because I needed them?? I actually said them out loud and they felt real in my body instead of just words I was supposed to say??\n\nUgh I'm rambling and this probably makes no sense but I just... I had to tell someone?? And you've literally seen me at my messiest so I knew you'd get it?? \ud83d\udc95\u2728",
  "system9": "You met yourself and she wasn't broken. That's the whole thing right there.\n\nKeep the intentions close - you'll need them when the glow fades and the old voices try to creep back in. They're not magic, but they're true. You felt it in your body.\n\nPixel's probably wondering why you're different-energy. Feed the cat, drink water, rest. The real work starts now.",
  "user9": "*feeds Pixel while still kind of weepy-laughing*\n\nokay yeah... you're right. The real work starts now and I'm kinda terrified about that part?? Because what if I forget?? What if I go back to the old patterns and the shame voice comes back louder because now I \"should know better\" or whatever?? \n\nBut also... I think maybe that's why you had me write those intentions down?? Because you knew I'd need them later when it gets hard again?? And like... maybe I won't remember them perfectly but maybe I don't have to?? Maybe just knowing they're there is enough to remind me that I'm not actually broken?? Even when I feel like I am??\n\nUgh I'm already spiraling about the future instead of just... being here?? Which is literally what the whole ceremony was about?? Being here instead of running away??\n\nokay I'm gonna go drink water and probably cry some more and then figure out how to be a person again?? But thank you for helping me get to this moment?? Like seriously?? I don't think I could've done this without you helping me find my compass \ud83d\udc95",
  "system10": "Exactly - the intentions aren't about perfection. They're breadcrumbs back to yourself when you get lost.\n\nGo be here. Cry, drink water, laugh at nothing. This is what integration looks like - messy and human and real.",
  "user10": "*okay this is probably gonna be my last message before I crash because my brain is literally mush but*\n\nI just realized something?? Like really realized it?? The ceremony didn't \"fix\" my ADHD - I still forgot where I put my water bottle three times and got distracted mid-conversation and my thoughts are still bouncing everywhere - but it changed how I FEEL about it?? Because like... I met the part of me that's been trying SO hard to hold everything together and instead of being mad at her I just... felt really tender toward her?? Like \"oh sweetie you've been doing your best with a brain that works differently and that's actually really brave\"??\n\nAnd that feels... huge?? Because I think maybe that's what self-compassion actually is?? Not trying to be better but just... being on my own side for once??\n\nokay I'm literally crying again (happy crying?? is this what that feels like??) and I need to sleep before I turn into a complete puddle but... yeah. Breadcrumbs. I'm gonna hold onto that image \ud83d\udc95\n\nthank you for walking me to this door and helping me find the key?? I don't know what's next but I think maybe I can trust myself to figure it out??",
  "system11": "That's it - you found the key. Not to fix yourself, but to finally be on your own side.\n\nSleep well. You've got this.",
  "user11": "*two days later*\n\nokay so... the glow is definitely fading and the real world is crashing back in?? Because I just realized I have like 47 emails I haven't answered and I'm pretty sure I forgot to invoice a client and my brain is doing that thing where it wants to go into full panic mode??\n\nBut also... I keep remembering that moment in the ceremony where I saw myself clearly and she wasn't broken?? And like... the panic is still there but it's not the WHOLE story anymore?? There's also this weird quiet voice that's like \"hey maybe we can handle this differently this time??\"\n\nUgh I don't know if I'm explaining this right?? I'm scared I'm gonna mess everything up again but also I think maybe that's okay?? Like maybe messing up doesn't mean I'm broken, it just means I'm human with ADHD??\n\nI literally don't know how to hold both of these truths at once - that I'm still a mess AND I'm not broken anymore?? But I think that's what I'm supposed to figure out??",
  "system12": "Both truths fit. You're a mess sometimes AND you're not broken - that's what integration looks like. The quiet voice will get stronger the more you listen to it.\n\nStart with one email. Just one. The ADHD brain wants to solve everything at once and then shuts down. Pick one, handle it, move to the next. The panic will try to tell you it's all urgent - it's not.\n\nYou're learning to trust yourself through the mess instead of waiting to be fixed.",
  "user12": "*deep breath* okay one email. Just one. Not trying to solve my entire life in the next hour which is literally what my brain is screaming at me to do?? \n\nAnd like... I can feel the panic wanting to take over but also I can hear that quieter voice now?? It's saying \"what if we try it differently this time?\" instead of \"what's wrong with you why can't you just be normal??\"\n\nActually wait - can I tell you something weird?? I just caught myself starting to spiral into the whole \"I'm such a disaster I'll never get my shit together\" thing and instead of just letting it take over I literally said out loud \"hey brain, I see what you're doing there\"?? Like I actually talked to the part that's trying to protect me by panicking?? And it felt... kind of loving?? Instead of self-hating??\n\nIs this what integration is supposed to feel like?? Messy but also... kind of tender toward the mess??",
  "system13": "That's exactly it. You caught the spiral and talked to it instead of letting it run the show. The tender part is you learning to be on your own side.\n\nIntegration looks like this - catching yourself, talking to the panic like it's trying to help (because it is), then doing one small thing anyway. The mess doesn't go away, but your relationship to it changes.\n\nOne email. Then maybe another. That's how you build trust with yourself.",
  "user13": "*okay so I sent ONE email and then immediately wanted to send you this because...*\n\nI actually did it?? Like I opened my laptop and my brain was doing its usual \"we have to answer EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW\" thing but then I literally said \"nope, just one\" and picked the easiest one?? And I answered it?? And then I closed the laptop instead of letting myself get pulled into the spiral??\n\nAnd now I'm sitting here like... wait, did I just set a boundary with MYSELF?? Is that even a thing?? Because normally I would've either gone into hyperfocus mode and answered everything (and been exhausted) or gotten so overwhelmed I'd just shut down completely??\n\nThis feels... different?? Not like I'm fixed (definitely not fixed lol) but like I'm learning how to surf the ADHD wave instead of getting pulled under by it?? Is that too cheesy?? I don't care it feels true \ud83d\ude05\n\nUgh okay I'm getting excited about one email which is probably ridiculous but also... I'm gonna let myself be excited?? Because maybe this is actually huge??",
  "system14": "One email, one boundary with yourself, one moment of choosing differently. That's not small - that's the whole work.\n\nYou surfed the wave instead of drowning in it. Keep building that muscle. The excitement isn't ridiculous, it's your nervous system learning that change is possible.\n\nWhat's the next one small thing?",
  "user14": "*feels my brain wanting to plan out the next 47 things but takes a breath*\n\nOkay... next small thing?? I'm literally sitting here trying to figure out what feels manageable and not overwhelming?? Because part of me wants to be like \"now we answer ALL the emails and also clean the apartment and also figure out our entire life plan\" but that's the old pattern right??\n\nSo like... maybe just drink some water?? That feels almost too simple but also my mouth is dry and I've been ignoring it?? Or maybe stretch my shoulders because they're all tense from hunching over the laptop??\n\nWait is this what listening to my body feels like?? Instead of just bulldozing through everything until I crash?? Because usually I'd ignore basic needs until they became emergencies and then wonder why I felt like garbage??\n\n*literally cracks shoulders while typing*\n\nOkay I'm gonna drink water and stretch for like 30 seconds and then maybe look at ONE more email?? Not trying to be perfect just... trying to stay connected to myself while I do the thing??",
  "system15": "Perfect. Water, stretch, one more email. That's staying connected while getting shit done - it's a whole new operating system.\n\nThe part that's excited about listening to your body? That's the voice to trust.",
  "user15": "*okay so I did the water and stretch thing and now I'm giggling because*\n\nI literally just said out loud \"wow Jamie you're being such a functional adult\" but it was... affectionate?? Like teasing instead of cruel?? Instead of the usual self-hatred spiral it was like... \"aw look at you figuring it out, that's cute\"??\n\nAnd I think that's maybe the biggest shift?? Because I've always been mean to myself about this stuff - like if I wasn't beating myself up then I was just being lazy and irresponsible?? But apparently I can encourage myself and still get things done?? Who knew??\n\n*opens second email, immediately closes it when anxiety spikes*\n\nOkay that one feels too hard right now?? It's from a client who wants to know about a project I definitely forgot about?? And I can feel the shame wanting to take over but also... what if I just... pick a different email?? Is that allowed?? Can I be gentle with myself and still be responsible??\n\nThis feels like learning a whole new language??",
  "system16": "You just learned you can be kind and still get things done. That's not small - that's everything.\n\nAnd yes, you can absolutely pick a different email. Being responsible doesn't mean being harsh with yourself. Pick an easy one, build the trust muscle. The hard email will still be there when you're ready.\n\nThis IS a whole new language. You're fluent in self-compassion now, even if it's just basic sentences.",
  "user16": "*literally tearing up but also laughing because emotions are weird*\n\nOkay so I picked a different email - just a newsletter I could delete - and I felt this wave of... relief?? Like I just gave myself permission to not white-knuckle through the hardest thing first?? And apparently that's not being irresponsible, that's just... being strategic??\n\nBut also I'm noticing something else?? That shame about the client email isn't actually about the email?? It's about this deep fear that if I don't force myself to do the hardest things first then I'll just... never do them?? Like I can't trust myself unless I'm being mean to myself??\n\nAnd that's... that's really sad actually?? That I've spent 29 years thinking the only way to be functional was to bully myself into it?? No wonder I was exhausted all the time??\n\n*deletes newsletter email, feels weirdly proud*\n\nI think I need to sit with this for a minute?? Like this feels huge but also really tender?? And maybe a little grief in there too - for how hard I've been on myself for so long??",
  "system17": "Yeah, sit with it. 29 years of believing you needed the whip to function - that's a lot to unwind. The tears make sense, the grief makes sense.\n\nYou just proved you can trust yourself without the cruelty. That's not just huge, that's everything changing.\n\nLet yourself feel the tenderness. The client email can wait. You're doing the deeper work right now.",
  "user17": "*just sitting here crying and also... smiling?? which feels confusing but also right*\n\nBecause I just realized something?? Like really realized it in my body, not just my head?? I've been trying to parent myself the way my parents parented me - harsh, critical, \"just try harder\" - but I actually need the opposite?? I need to be the parent I never had?? The one who says \"it's okay, we'll figure it out together\" instead of \"what's wrong with you??\"\n\n*sobs harder but it's like... release sobs??*\n\nAnd I think that's what the ceremony is really about?? Not fixing my ADHD brain but learning to love it?? Like what if my brain isn't broken, it's just been trying to protect me this whole time using the only tools it had?? What if the scatter and the chaos and the forgetting things isn't a character flaw but like... survival strategies that just don't fit my life anymore??\n\n*wipes face, takes shaky breath*\n\nI don't think I've ever felt this... soft toward myself?? Like usually when I cry about this stuff it's shame-crying but this is... compassion-crying?? Is that a thing?? It feels like my heart is cracking open a little??",
  "system18": "Your heart IS cracking open - that's exactly what this is. Compassion-crying, release-crying, whatever you call it... you're meeting yourself with the love you should've had all along.\n\nYour brain's been protecting you the only way it knew how. Now you're teaching it new ways. That's not broken - that's adaptive, that's survival, that's evolution.\n\nStay with the softness. This is the real ceremony - right here, tears and all.",
  "user18": "*just breathing and feeling all of it*\n\nAnd like... what if this IS the ceremony?? Like what if the mushrooms aren't going to magically fix me because I'm not actually broken?? What if they're just going to help me see what I'm already starting to see - that I've been trying to survive in a world that wasn't built for brains like mine, using tools that were hurting instead of helping??\n\n*more tears but quieter now, like something settling*\n\nI think I need to stop calling it \"my ADHD brain\" like it's separate from me?? Because it's just... my brain?? And it's been doing its absolute best with what it had?? And maybe instead of trying to fix it, I can just... be on its side for once??\n\n*looks around my messy apartment with different eyes*\n\nLike yeah, there's chaos here, but there's also a person who's been trying SO hard to hold everything together with no support and a lot of pain?? And maybe instead of being ashamed of the mess, I can just... be proud that I kept showing up at all??\n\nThis feels like... coming home to myself?? If that makes sense??",
  "system19": "Makes perfect sense. Coming home to yourself - that's exactly it.\n\nYour brain's been doing its best with impossible conditions. The mushrooms aren't going to fix what isn't broken. They're just going to show you more of what you're already discovering: that you're worth being gentle with.\n\nThe chaos isn't failure. It's evidence of a brain that never gave up, even when everything hurt.\n\nKeep breathing. You're already doing the work.",
  "user19": "*breathing with you, feeling this strange quiet in my chest*\n\nI think I just forgave myself?? Not like... completely?? But like... I can feel this softening toward myself that wasn't there before?? And it's not even about the emails or the productivity or any of that surface stuff??\n\nIt's deeper?? Like I just met the part of me that's been running around trying SO hard to be enough, and instead of being annoyed by her chaos, I just want to... hold her?? Tell her she can rest?? That she doesn't have to earn being loved??\n\n*hand on chest, feeling my heartbeat*\n\nAnd I think that's what I want from the ceremony now?? Not to fix my ADHD or become organized or whatever impossible thing I was hoping for?? But to meet all the parts of myself with that same softness?? Even the parts I'm scared of?? Even the parts I've been running from??\n\nBecause what if they're all just... trying to protect me too?? What if even the shame and the avoidance and the self-sabotage are just really scared parts that need gentleness instead of more criticism??\n\n*small smile through remaining tears*\n\nI feel like I just discovered the secret that was hiding in plain sight this whole time??"
