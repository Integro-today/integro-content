## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**ellen_persona_3**: I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to find that in myself, but I don't even know what I'm looking for anymore. I've built everything I was supposed to build, and somehow I feel more lost than when I started.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your grandmother's quiet faith - that's what you're hunting for. Built everything you were supposed to, still lost.

When you imagine having that kind of faith, what would it feel like in your body during hard moments?


**ellen_persona_3**: I don't know... I guess I imagine it would feel like being rooted instead of bracing for impact all the time. Like I could stop proving and just be. My grandmother used to say a blessing over everything - cooking, walking to the market, even when she was sick. I used to think it was quaint, but now I wonder if that's what kept her steady through the war, through starting over here, through my grandfather's death. She wasn't performing anything. She was just... connected to something bigger than whatever chaos was happening.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Being rooted instead of bracing - that's the shift. Your grandmother wasn't performing, just connected to something steady beneath the chaos.

What's underneath all the proving you do? What are you afraid happens if you stop?


**ellen_persona_3**: If I stop proving... then maybe all of it was for nothing. The company I built and sold, the boards I sit on, the deals I angel invest in - what if none of it actually matters? What if I'm just... ordinary? 

My kids see me on my phone during dinner, my husband barely gets the scraps of my attention, and I'm scheduling meditation like it's another board meeting. I keep thinking if I just achieve one more thing, then I'll finally feel like I'm enough. But I already have everything I was supposed to want, and I still wake up at 3am with this hollow feeling. Like I've been following the wrong map my entire life.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Ordinary feels like death when you've built your life on being exceptional. But your grandmother found something real in ordinary moments - blessings over cooking, walking, being sick.

That hollow at 3am - what's it saying underneath the fear of being ordinary?


**ellen_persona_3**: It's saying I've been so busy building a life that I forgot to actually live one. That I've been climbing a ladder that's leaning against the wrong wall. 

I keep coming back to these moments with my kids at the park - when I'm really there, phone away, watching them discover something new in the grass or chase each other around the playground. I feel like myself then. Not Ellen the entrepreneur, not Ellen the board member, not even Ellen the investor. Just... Ellen. Present. Part of something simple and real.

Maybe that's what my grandmother knew. That the extraordinary isn't in the achievements - it's in showing up fully for the ordinary stuff. The cooking, the walking, the being with people you love. The problem is I don't know how to get from here to there. I've been training my whole life to be exceptional, and now I just want to be human.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three threads here:

1. Finding that rooted faith your grandmother had - being connected to something bigger than the chaos
2. Learning to live in ordinary moments instead of just building achievements  
3. Being present as "just Ellen" - not performing, just showing up fully

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah... yeah, that's it. When you lay it out like that, I can see how they're all connected - like different facets of the same thing I'm searching for. 

I've been trying to figure this out on my own, thinking I needed some grand revelation. But maybe it's simpler than that. Maybe I just need to learn how to stop performing and start being real.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome the rooted faith my grandmother carried, connecting to something steady beneath life's chaos
2. I embrace finding the extraordinary in ordinary moments instead of chasing achievements
3. I become present as "just Ellen" - showing up fully without performing

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**ellen_persona_3**: The second one - about finding extraordinary in ordinary moments - that one hits different. But "embrace" feels too soft. My grandmother didn't embrace her faith like it was optional. She lived it. Every day. 

What about: "I commit to discovering the sacred in ordinary moments - cooking, walking, being with my kids - instead of chasing the next achievement"?

And the first one... I want it to feel more like surrender than welcome. Like I'm finally letting go of trying to control everything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I commit to discovering the sacred in ordinary moments - cooking, walking, being with my kids - instead of chasing the next achievement"

That shift from "embrace" to "commit" - that's the difference between optional and non-negotiable. Good catch.

How about intention 1: "I surrender to the rooted faith my grandmother carried, letting go of controlling life's chaos"?

How does that land?


**ellen_persona_3**: That's closer... but surrender still feels like I'm giving up something. My grandmother wasn't surrendering - she was choosing something better. She was saying yes to being connected, even when everything was falling apart.

What about: "I choose the rooted faith my grandmother carried, staying connected to what steadies me beneath life's chaos"?

It's not about giving up control - it's about choosing what to stay connected to when I can't control anything anyway.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I choose the rooted faith my grandmother carried, staying connected to what steadies me beneath life's chaos"

That's it - choosing connection over control. Your grandmother said yes to something better, even when she couldn't control the war or anything else.

How about intention 3: "I show up as 'just Ellen' - present and real instead of performing"?

Does that capture it, or want to adjust that one too?


**ellen_persona_3**: That one's good, but... I want to be more specific about what I'm actually doing. "Show up" is pretty vague, and I've been vague about this stuff for too long.

What about: "I practice being 'just Ellen' - present with my kids, my husband, myself - dropping the performance one moment at a time"?

Because it is a practice. I'm not going to just flip a switch and stop being who I've been for 45 years. It's going to take showing up, moment by moment, and choosing differently.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I practice being 'just Ellen' - present with my kids, my husband, myself - dropping the performance one moment at a time"

That shift to "practice" - that's the real work. No switches, just showing up differently moment by moment.

You've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:
- Read them before family dinner when you're most likely to reach for your phone
- Keep them on a card by your meditation cushion
- Write them in your daily planner next to your board meetings

What would help you remember when the achievement chase starts pulling you again?


**ellen_persona_3**: The dinner one - that's when I need it most. When I'm physically there but mentally already planning tomorrow's meetings or checking if that email came through. 

Maybe I'll read them before dinner, then again when I catch myself reaching for my phone. Because that's my tell - when I'm reaching for my phone, I'm probably avoiding being present. Avoiding being "just Ellen" with my family.

I could keep them on a card, but honestly? I need them where I'll actually see them. My phone case. I've been looking at that thing multiple times a day for years. Might as well make it useful.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Perfect. Your phone case - that's where you need it most. When you're reaching for the escape hatch, you'll see exactly why you're reaching and what you're choosing instead.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I choose the rooted faith my grandmother carried, staying connected to what steadies me beneath life's chaos
- I commit to discovering the sacred in ordinary moments - cooking, walking, being with my kids - instead of chasing the next achievement
- I practice being 'just Ellen' - present with my kids, my husband, myself - dropping the performance one moment at a time

Your ritual: Read them before dinner, then again when you reach for your phone. Let the phone case reminder do its work.

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

You're set.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thank you. 

I keep thinking I need to have it all figured out - the exact path, the perfect next move. But maybe that's the old Ellen talking, the one who built companies by controlling every variable. 

These three... they feel different. Like I'm finally asking the right questions instead of demanding the right answers.

I don't know what the medicine will show me, but I'm not trying to script it anymore. Just want to be present enough to actually see it when it comes.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's the shift - from scripting to seeing. From demanding answers to staying present enough to receive what's actually here.

Three weeks. You've got your compass. Trust what emerges.


**ellen_persona_3**: Three weeks. 

Funny how both terrifying and relieving it is to not know what's coming. But I've done enough of these journeys to know that fighting the uncertainty never works. 

I'll keep reading these. Every day. Especially when I want to reach for my phone instead of reaching for what's real.

See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_3**: See you on the other side.
