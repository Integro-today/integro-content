## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to understand your context first. Are you preparing for a specific psychedelic journey with a particular medicine (ayahuasca, psilocybin, etc.) at a specific location? This helps me tailor the opening properly.

Once I have those details, I'll send the complete opening message to begin your intention-setting process.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Hi, my name is Tommy. My daughter Mai set this up for me. She say this will help me get ready for the medicine in Oregon. I don't really understand what is psilocybin but Mai say it's okay. I want to do this right. Can you help me understand what I need to do? Sorry if this is dumb question.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, no dumb questions here. You're doing this right by asking.

Psilocybin is a medicine from mushrooms that helps people see their patterns and pain differently. Think of it like a strong mirror for your mind - shows you what's really there so you can work with it.

Your daughter Mai cares about you. She set this up because she believes in your healing.

Intentions are like setting your compass before a journey - they help the medicine show you what matters most. I'll help you build 3 simple ones.

What brought you to this work? What's heavy in your life right now?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Thank you for explain. I think I understand - it's like medicine that shows me what is in my head so maybe I can feel better?

What is heavy... I think about the worry all the time. I don't sleep good. I wake up at 2 AM and worry about everything - did I forget to order noodles, is David okay at his job, did I say wrong thing to customer. The worry never stop. Mai think maybe medicine help with that.

Also I feel... how you say... not smart enough? My kids are all engineers, they understand computers and books. I only know restaurant. When they talk about their work I don't understand. I feel embarrass.

Is that what you mean by heavy? Or I'm suppose to think about different things?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Yes, Tommy - that's exactly what I mean by heavy. The worry that keeps you up at 2 AM, checking on noodles and customers. The feeling of not being smart enough when your engineer kids talk about things you don't understand.

The medicine can help with both. It won't make you suddenly understand computers, but it might show you that your restaurant wisdom - feeding people, knowing what they need - that's its own kind of intelligence.

When you imagine sleeping through the night without worry, what would that feel like in your body? What would be different the next morning?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Oh... when I think about sleeping all night, I feel... my shoulders drop down. Usually they are up here, tight. And my chest - it feel like someone open the window, fresh air come in. No more tight here.

Next morning I would wake up and not feel tired already. Maybe I smile at Linda first thing, not think about what I forget to do. Maybe I drink my coffee slow, not rush to check everything three times.

I would still go to restaurant - I like to work, to cook, to see my regular customers. But maybe I not worry if Mrs. Tran is mad because her pho take long time. Maybe I just know I doing my best.

Is that okay intention? To want sleep good and not worry so much? Or I need something more... how you say... deep?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, that's perfect. Your shoulders dropping, air in your chest, drinking coffee slow - that's exactly the kind of real we want. Nothing wrong with wanting peace from the worry.

The medicine works with honest, simple things. Your body already knows what healing looks like.

I'm hearing two main threads:
1. Finding peaceful sleep so you wake up rested, not checking everything three times
2. Being kind to yourself - knowing you're doing your best at the restaurant without the worry voice

What about feeling not smart enough around your kids? Is that something you want to work with too, or mainly focus on the worry and sleep?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I think... I want to work with the worry first. The kids thing... that feel too big right now. Maybe later, when I don't feel so tight in chest all the time.

The worry I know good. It live with me every day for long time. If medicine can help me see that I'm doing okay, that I don't need check everything three times - that would be... very good. Linda always tell me "Tommy you doing fine" but I don't believe her. Maybe medicine help me believe.

So my intention is I want to sleep through night and wake up feeling okay, not already tired. And I want to trust myself more, not worry I doing everything wrong. Is that okay? How many intention I need? You say three?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, you're doing this perfectly. Start with the worry - that's wise. The kids thing can wait.

Yes, three intentions gives you a solid compass without overwhelming you.

Based on what you shared:
1. I welcome peaceful sleep through the night so I wake up rested, not already tired
2. I trust myself to know I'm doing okay, not checking everything three times  
3. I believe Linda when she says I'm doing fine instead of doubting

How do these land? Want to adjust anything before we lock them in?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: These feel... they feel right. Like you take the words from my mouth but make them more... clear? I especially like number three about believing Linda. She been telling me this for twenty-six years and I never believe her.

But I have question - when I go to Oregon and they give me medicine, how do I use these? Do I say them out loud? Do I write them down and bring with me? Do I think about them? What if I forget them when medicine start working?

Also, is it okay if I'm still scare? Even with good intentions, I'm still worry I do something wrong.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, it's good you're scared. Means you're taking this seriously. The medicine works with scared people all the time.

Write your intentions on a small card. Keep it simple - just the three phrases. Bring it with you. When the medicine starts working, you don't need to think hard about them. Just hold the card, read them once if you want, then let them go. The medicine remembers what matters.

If you forget them completely, that's okay too. Your body already knows what you want - peaceful sleep, trusting yourself, believing Linda. Those desires are inside you now.

How do you want to keep these close until Oregon? In your wallet? By your bed? What feels right?


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: I think I put them in my wallet - I always have that with me. And maybe write them again on paper by my bed, so I see them when I wake up and remember what I'm working for.

So I just need the card and... how you say... show up? The people there will help me if I get confuse or scare? Mai say they are nice people who help people like me.

I feel little bit better now. Still nervous but... like I have map in my pocket. Not lost in dark anymore. Is there anything else I need to do before Oregon? Like things to practice or buy?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Exactly - show up with your card. The people there know how to help when you get confused or scared. That's their job. You're not alone in this.

Your wallet and by your bed - that's solid. You'll see them every day.

Nothing else to buy or practice. You've been doing the real work already - noticing the worry, wanting something different. The intentions are your map, like you said.

Your three intentions:
- I welcome peaceful sleep through the night so I wake up rested, not already tired
- I trust myself to know I'm doing okay, not checking everything three times  
- I believe Linda when she says I'm doing fine instead of doubting

Keep them close. Trust what emerges. You're ready, Tommy.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I write them down now and put in wallet. And I trust what you say - that I'm ready, that people there help me.

Thank you for take time to explain everything. I feel... I don't know the word... lighter? Like maybe this can really help me. Not so scare anymore.

I appreciate your help very much. Mai was right - you good at this. I hope I can tell you after Oregon that I sleep through the night and believe Linda finally.

Is okay if I message you again if I get scare before the medicine day?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Tommy, lighter is the right word. You got it.

Yes, message me if you get scared before Oregon. I'll be here.

Looking forward to hearing about that first morning you wake up rested, drinking coffee slow while Linda tells you "see, I told you you're doing fine."

You've got this. Your map's in your pocket.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Thank you. I feel... okay. Still nervous but not so lost now. I have the map, like you say.

I write the intentions down tonight and put them in my wallet tomorrow. And I will remember you tell me I'm ready, that I can do this.

Thank you for be patient with me. I appreciate your help very much.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're welcome, Tommy. You were never lost - just needed to see the path that was already there.

Go get some rest. Oregon's waiting for you.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. Good night. Thank you again.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good night, Tommy. Sleep well.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Good night. I hope I can sleep good tonight with this lighter feeling. Thank you.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's the plan - let that lighter feeling carry you into sleep. 

Good night, Tommy.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Yes. I try. Good night.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good night. Let it come.


**tommy_confused_instruction_follower_persona_1**: Okay. I let it come. Good night.
