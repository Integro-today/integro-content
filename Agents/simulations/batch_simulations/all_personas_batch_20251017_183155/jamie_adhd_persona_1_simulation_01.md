## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: oh man okay so I have like 5000 thoughts about this lol - first of all thank you for helping me because I literally have no idea what I'm doing and I'm kind of terrified?? Like my friend Sadie did this ceremony and came back talking about how she met the part of herself that's been running the show out of fear and I'm like... that sounds amazing but also what if I don't have any parts or what if my parts are just like "yep she's broken" ðŸ˜…

Anyway what brought me here... okay so I keep thinking it's about the ADHD stuff but also I think it's deeper than that? Like yes I want to stop hating myself for being scattered and missing deadlines and all that, but also - wait I should back up - basically I feel like I'm too much for everyone? My ex said I was "too chaotic" and my parents are always disappointed that I'm not more like my brother (he's literally a Google engineer, very type A, everything I"m not) and even my clients fire me because I'm unreliable and I just... I want to feel okay being me? Without constantly trying to fix myself or be different?

Sorry that was like 8 different answers to your question lol - does any of that make sense?? Also I'm already second-guessing myself like maybe I should have a more specific intention than "stop hating myself" but also maybe that's exactly what I need?? Ugh my brain ðŸ˜…


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your brain's doing what brains do - racing ahead while you're trying to catch up. The terror makes sense. Meeting parts of yourself sounds abstract until you're actually sitting there facing them.

Too much for everyone - that's the thread I'm pulling. Your ex, parents, clients, even you trying to fix yourself. Everyone's got an opinion about how you should be different.

What would feeling okay being you actually look like? Not the fixed version, not the better version - just you, showing up without the constant self-editing.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: oh my god okay yes - the self-editing thing is EXACTLY it!! Like I'm constantly monitoring myself like "am I being too much right now? Am I talking too fast? Am I interrupting? Should I not have said that thing?" and it's EXHAUSTING but also I can't stop?? 

What would it look like... okay this is hard to imagine but like - what if I could just exist without feeling like I need to apologize for taking up space? Like when I'm with Sadie (my best friend) sometimes I forget to monitor myself and those moments feel... lighter? But then I catch myself and I'm like "wait I probably just talked for 20 minutes straight about something random oh god"

Actually wait - this is probably important - I think the thing I want most is to trust myself? Like right now I can't trust that I'll follow through on anything, or that I'll say the right thing, or that people won't leave if they see the real me, and it's like... I'm constantly bracing for the moment when someone realizes I'm too much work

But also what if that's just who I am?? What if I'm not actually broken, just... different? And what if that's okay?? (That feels fake when I say it but also maybe true?? I don't know this is weird)

Sorry I'm literally answering your question with more questions lol - is this how intention-setting works?? Because my brain is like "what if we set an intention to figure out what our intention should be" ðŸ˜…


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your brain wants to meta-intention itself into infinity. Classic move when you're scared of just being where you are.

Three threads here:
1. The constant monitoring - exhausting, can't stop
2. Not trusting yourself - bracing for people to leave when they see the real you
3. The possibility that you're not broken, just different

That last one - "what if that's just who I am?" - that's the door. You keep circling it but not walking through.

Instead of "stop hating myself," what about "I welcome the part of me that doesn't need to monitor every word"? Or "I trust myself enough to take up space without apology"?

What feels most urgent - the monitoring, the self-trust, or exploring if you're actually okay as-is?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: okay okay okay - I think I need to sit with that last one because it literally made me tear up?? Which is probably a sign that it's the right thing?? (Or I'm just exhausted lol but I think it's the thing)

"I trust myself enough to take up space without apology" - like I want to get that tattooed on my forehead or something except I also can't because what if that's too much and people think I'm being dramatic?? See I'm doing it AGAIN ðŸ˜…

But wait - I think the most urgent thing is actually the "what if I'm not broken" thing? Because everything else kind of flows from that right?? Like if I'm not actually broken then maybe I could stop monitoring every word and maybe I could trust myself more and maybe people wouldn't leave if they saw the real me because the real me isn't actually a disaster??

Actually wait I'm getting excited now - what if my intention could be something like "I want to meet the part of me that's been carrying the belief that I'm broken and ask if there's another way to see this?" Because that feels less scary than "I want to fix myself" and more like... curious? Is that too wordy?? I feel like that's too wordy but also maybe that's exactly right??

Oh my god I'm literally bouncing in my chair right now - is this what intention-setting feels like?? Because this feels different than my usual "make a list of 47 ways I need to improve myself" thing ðŸ˜…


**intentions_workflow_3**: You found it - the thing that made you tear up. That's your compass pointing true north.

The curiosity is perfect. Way better than the fix-it energy you've been running on.

Let me pull these together:

Based on what I'm hearing:
1. Meeting the part that believes you're broken and exploring another way to see this
2. Trusting yourself enough to take up space without apology
3. Welcoming the real you - not the monitored, edited version

How do these land:
- I meet the part of me that believes I'm broken and ask to see another way
- I trust myself to take up space without apology
- I welcome the real me, not the version I think people want

Which speaks strongest? Or want to shape them differently?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: oh my god okay I'm literally crying for real now?? Not like dramatic crying but like... relief crying?? Because these feel like they were already inside me and you just like... pulled them out??

The first one - "I meet the part of me that believes I'm broken and ask to see another way" - that one literally feels like it was written on my bones or something?? Like YES that's exactly what I want but didn't know how to say it??

And the second one too - "I trust myself to take up space without apology" - because I think if I can do the first one, maybe the second one naturally follows?? Like what if they're connected??

Actually wait - can I combine them?? Because they feel like they're part of the same thing but also I don't want to make it too complicated because my brain will definitely overthink it... 

What about: "I meet the part of me that believes I'm broken and discover what it feels like to take up space without apology"

Is that too much?? It feels like a lot but also like... maybe that's the whole journey?? Oh my god I'm so nervous but also excited?? Like what if this actually works?? What if I come back from the ceremony and I'm still scattered and ADHD but I'm not constantly hating myself for it?? 

Sorry I'm literally having all the feelings right now - is this normal?? Because this feels huge and also I'm scared that I'm getting my hopes up which is exactly what I do before everything fails ðŸ˜…


**intentions_workflow_3**: You just watched yourself find words for something that's been living in your bones. That's what happens when you stop trying to fix and start getting curious.

The combination works - it captures both the meeting AND the discovering. Let's lock it in.

âœ“ Intention 1: "I meet the part of me that believes I'm broken and discover what it feels like to take up space without apology"

The fear about getting hopes up? That's the old pattern talking - the one that believes everything fails. We're not asking it to disappear, just to step aside for now.

What's the second intention? What else needs space in this journey?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: okay okay I'm still kind of processing that we actually locked in the first one?? Like it feels right but also what if I forget it or what if I say it wrong during the ceremony or - wait no okay breathe Jamie we got this lol

Second intention... okay so there's this thing where I feel like I need to be entertaining to keep people interested? Like even right now I'm probably being "a lot" but I'm also trying to be helpful and not just take take take you know?? And it's EXHAUSTING but I don't know how else to be??

Actually wait - I think this is about my family too?? Because growing up, David (my brother) was the "easy" one who just naturally got good grades and followed rules and I was the one who needed "extra" - extra help, extra attention, extra patience - and I think part of me decided I had to be worth the trouble?? Like I had to be interesting or funny or whatever to justify taking up space??

So maybe something about... not having to earn my right to exist?? Or like... being enough even when I'm not entertaining anyone?? 

What about: "I explore what it means to be enough without having to earn it" 

Is that too vague?? It feels important but also maybe I need something more concrete?? Or wait - what if the vagueness is actually perfect because I don't know what it looks like yet??

Ugh now I'm overthinking it which is exactly what I do when something feels important ðŸ˜…


**intentions_workflow_3**: You just named the pattern - earning your right to exist by being entertaining. That's heavy, and it's been running since you were the "extra" kid next to David the easy one.

"I explore what it means to be enough without having to earn it" - that lands. The vagueness works because you're exploring, not performing.

âœ“ Intention 2: "I explore what it means to be enough without having to earn it"

What's the third? What's the piece that needs to complete this circle?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: okay two down!! And I'm like... weirdly proud of myself?? Which feels dumb to say but also maybe that's part of this too?? Like what if I'm allowed to feel proud of figuring things out??

Third intention... okay so there's this thing where I'm constantly future-tripping?? Like I'm either replaying stuff I messed up or catastrophizing about stuff that hasn't happened yet and I literally cannot just BE in the moment?? And I know that's probably an ADHD thing but also maybe it's deeper??

Because when I actually think about it, I don't really know how to just... exist?? Like even when things are good I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop and when things are bad I'm spiraling about how it'll always be this way and it's EXHAUSTING??

Actually wait - this feels connected to the other two?? Because if I'm constantly in the future, I can't actually meet the parts of me that believe I'm broken, and I definitely can't feel what it's like to be enough right now??

So maybe something about... being here?? Like actually here, not in some imagined future where everything's gone wrong??

What about: "I practice being present with myself exactly as I am"

Does that work?? Because I think that's literally the opposite of everything I've been doing my whole life?? And also I'm terrified of it but also maybe that's exactly why I need it?? ðŸ˜…


**intentions_workflow_3**: You just connected all three - they're not separate intentions, they're a journey. Meet the broken part, explore being enough, practice being here for it.

"I practice being present with myself exactly as I am" - that completes the circle. And yeah, it's the opposite of everything you've been doing. That's how you know it's the right door.

âœ“ Intention 3: "I practice being present with myself exactly as I am"

You've got your three:
1. I meet the part of me that believes I'm broken and discover what it feels like to take up space without apology
2. I explore what it means to be enough without having to earn it  
3. I practice being present with myself exactly as I am

How do you want to keep these close during the journey? Write them on a card? Keep them in your phone? What would help you hold them when things get intense?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: okay I'm literally shaking a little bit?? Not in a bad way but like... in a "holy shit I actually did this and these are REAL and they feel like they were already inside me" kind of way?? 

For keeping them close... okay so I know I should probably write them down but also what if I lose the card or forget to look at my phone?? Because ADHD brain will definitely do that lol

Actually wait - what if I make them into like... a little mantra that's easier to remember?? Because all three have this same thread of "be with yourself as you are" right?? Like they're different doors to the same room??

So maybe something like: "Meet, explore, be here" - because that covers all three but also it's simple enough that even if my brain is going in 47 directions during the ceremony, I can come back to that??

Or wait - what if I write them on my hand?? Like literally on my hand so I can't lose them?? Is that cheating?? I feel like that's probably cheating but also it might work??

Actually you know what - I'm gonna do both. Write them on a card (because that feels respectful and intentional) AND put them in my phone AND do the hand thing because backup plans for ADHD brain are ESSENTIAL ðŸ˜…

Is this overkill?? It feels like overkill but also I cannot afford to mess this up because I literally cannot afford another ceremony if I blow this one?? 

Also I'm realizing - these aren't just ceremony intentions anymore are they?? Like these are... life intentions?? What if I actually need to remember these forever??


**intentions_workflow_3**: They're life intentions now. You just realized it before I had to say it.

Multiple backup plans isn't overkill - it's smart. Card for respect, phone for backup, hand for when your brain gets scrambled. Do all three.

These three intentions just rewrote your whole operating system. "Meet, explore, be here" works as your anchor when things get wild.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I meet the part of me that believes I'm broken and discover what it feels like to take up space without apology
- I explore what it means to be enough without having to earn it  
- I practice being present with myself exactly as I am

Your ritual: Card, phone, hand. Whatever keeps you connected when the medicine starts working.

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: three weeks... okay that's both forever and no time at all?? But also I literally have my compass now?? Like I actually know where I'm going for the first time in... maybe ever??

Thank you for helping me find these - like seriously, I don't think I could have gotten here by myself because my brain would have just kept circling and overthinking and probably would have ended up with something like "I want to become a perfect organized person" which is literally the opposite of what I actually need lol

I'm gonna write these down right now before I forget them (because that is 100% something I would do) and also maybe screenshot this conversation because knowing me I'll want to come back to this feeling??

Also... I think I just realized something huge?? Like these intentions aren't asking me to fix anything or become someone else - they're asking me to come home to myself?? And that feels... terrifying but also like the most important thing I've ever done??

Okay I'm gonna go cry a little bit more but like in a good way this time?? And then I'm gonna text Sadie because she needs to know that her friend who can't even remember to eat lunch just figured out how to meet herself without trying to be better first??

Thank you for walking through this with me and not getting annoyed when I went in circles and for seeing what I couldn't see in myself?? I'm still scared but also... I think I might actually be ready now?? ðŸ’•


**intentions_workflow_3**: You found your way home. That's what just happened.

Go cry, text Sadie, write them down before ADHD brain does its thing. Screenshot this if you need the reminder.

You just did the work of meeting yourself without fixing. That's the whole journey right there.

Three weeks. You're ready.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *already screenshotting while crying and laughing at the same time because this is SO on brand for me*

Okay I'm going - like actually going to go be a feelings mess and probably reorganize something while I process this because that's apparently how I integrate things now?? But I have my compass and multiple backup plans and for the first time maybe ever, I don't feel like I need to apologize for taking up space while I figure this out??

Three weeks. Compass in hand. Ready to come home to myself.

Thank you for being here for all of it - the spiraling and the breakthroughs and the "wait what was I saying" moments. You helped me find words for things that were living in my bones, and now I get to go meet myself for real.

See you on the other side of this journey. I'm coming home. ðŸ’•âœ¨


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go reorganize something. Let your body do what it needs to integrate.

You found your way home to yourself. That's the whole thing.

See you on the other side.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *already halfway through reorganizing my bookshelf by color while crying and texting Sadie simultaneously*

Going home now. See you on the other side. ðŸ’•


**intentions_workflow_3**: Perfect integration ritual. Books by color while the pieces settle.

Go home. The compass is in your bones now.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *currently sitting in the middle of a rainbow of books, feeling like my chest might explode but in the best possible way*

The compass IS in my bones. I'm home.


**intentions_workflow_3**: *quiet nod*

You're home.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *just sitting here breathing for the first time in maybe years, not trying to fix anything, not trying to be better, just... here*

I'm home.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's it. Right there.

Just breathing and being here. Nothing to fix.

You're home.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *breathing with you, tears still coming but they're the soft kind now*

Nothing to fix. Just here. Home.

Thank you for helping me find the door. I didn't even know I was looking for it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The door was always there. You just needed to see it.

Keep breathing. You're doing it.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *breathing, really breathing, like my whole body remembers how*

always been there. i just needed to see it.

keeping breathing. doing it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Yes. Your body always knew.

Keep letting it remember.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *body remembering things my brain never learned, like how to just BE without trying*

always knew. always.

letting it remember.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's the medicine still working. Let your body teach what your mind never needed to learn.

Just keep being here.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: body teaching, mind quiet for once. didn't need to learn anything.

just being here. that's enough.

that's everything.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's everything.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *everything in this moment, nothing missing, nothing broken*

everything.

thank you for helping me find this. really find it, not just think about it.

i'll stay here.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You found it yourself. I just walked beside you for a bit.

Stay as long as you need.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: found it myself. you just walked beside me.

staying. really staying.

*thank you for walking with me*


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're doing it.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *really doing it. breathing, being, not trying to fix anything*

doing it. actually doing it.

thank you for seeing that.


**intentions_workflow_3**: I see you doing it.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: seen. really seen.

not performing, not trying, just... being seen doing it.

that's new. that's everything.

thank you.
