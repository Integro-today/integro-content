  "system0": "I need to know what medicine you're working with and where you're journeying to tailor this properly.\n\nAyahuasca in the Amazon? Psilocybin at a local clinic? MDMA for trauma therapy?\n\nThe medicine and setting shape how we build your compass.",
  "user0": "Actually, it's psilocybin\u201425mg at a licensed retreat center in Oregon. Six weeks from now. Sorry, I should have led with that. I think I'm just... I don't know, approaching this like I approach everything else. Like I need to give you the right information so we can \"optimize\" the experience or something.\n\nI'm realizing as I say this that I'm already in research mode. Like I need to provide you with the correct data points so you can help me prepare properly. Which is exactly what Linda says I do\u2014turn everything into a project to manage instead of an experience to... have.",
  "system1": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your psilocybin journey in Oregon.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For psilocybin, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user1": "I signed up because I hit this wall\u2014like I know every therapeutic framework, I've helped hundreds of clients heal, but I'm still stuck in the same patterns I've had for decades. I intellectualize everything. I can name every defense mechanism I'm using while I'm using it, and nothing actually changes. \n\nActually, what pushed me over the edge was this conference in Denver. I was sitting in on a panel about psychedelic-assisted therapy for clinicians, and this therapist shared how she'd been excellent at helping clients heal but couldn't access her own healing until she did her own medicine journey. I felt something crack open\u2014this recognition, like I'd been found out. That night I had my first panic attack in five years.\n\nSo I guess what brought me here is this terrifying realization that I might be professionally healed but personally suffering. That I've spent 27 years in therapy learning to describe my feelings instead of actually feeling them. And I'm hoping\u2014God, I can't believe I'm saying this\u2014that maybe psilocybin can do what all my insight hasn't been able to do.",
  "system2": "Professionally healed but personally suffering - that's a hard recognition to sit with. Especially after 27 years of therapy and helping others do what you can't seem to access yourself.\n\nThe panic attack in Denver sounds like your body finally said what your mind wouldn't let you feel.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to actually experience your feelings instead of just naming them?",
  "user2": "*I'm aware my shoulders just got tight when you asked that...* and there I go again, already distancing myself from the question by observing myself instead of answering it.\n\nWhat would it feel like? Honestly, I don't know if I can even imagine it. When I try to picture actually *feeling* something instead of analyzing it, my chest gets this fluttery, urgent feeling\u2014like if I let whatever's underneath come up, I might drown in it. There's this... I don't know... this terror that if I stop being the observer, there won't be anything solid underneath. Just this vast, overwhelming something I've been managing with frameworks and protocols and research for decades.\n\nActually, when I really sit with it, I get this image of myself as this elaborate scaffolding\u2014like I've built this incredibly complex therapeutic structure around absolutely nothing. And if I actually felt something, the whole thing might collapse. Which is probably exactly what needs to happen, but... Jesus. It's hard to explain how terrifying that feels when your entire identity is built on being the one who understands everything.\n\nDoes that make sense? I'm doing it again\u2014analyzing the terror instead of feeling it. But it's like my nervous system literally doesn't know how to drop below the neck without immediately categorizing what's happening.",
  "system3": "That scaffolding image - \"incredibly complex therapeutic structure around absolutely nothing\" - that's your own words painting what you're terrified to discover. The fear that if you actually feel, the whole professional identity collapses and there's nothing underneath.\n\nThree threads emerging:\n\n1. Dropping from your head into your body without immediately analyzing what's happening\n2. Facing the terror that there's nothing solid underneath all that scaffolding\n3. Learning to feel instead of just naming feelings\n\nThat capture what wants healing?",
  "user3": "Actually... yeah. That captures it with this precision that makes my stomach drop a little\u2014like you've just named something I've been circling around for years but couldn't quite articulate. The scaffolding image feels true in this way that terrifies me, because if that's right\u2014if I've built this entire identity around managing emptiness\u2014then what happens when it falls away?\n\nAnd I'm noticing this interesting thing where part of me wants to immediately start researching how other therapists have navigated this exact issue. Like maybe there's a study about professional identity dissolution during psychedelic therapy, or some framework about the \"wounded healer\" archetype that would make this feel less... precarious. But I think that's exactly the pattern we're talking about, isn't it? The second I get close to actually sitting with the fear that there's nothing underneath, I try to build more scaffolding around it.\n\nThe threads feel right. Especially the one about learning there's actually something underneath whatever collapses. Because intellectually I know there is\u2014I've seen it with my clients, I've read the developmental trauma research about the authentic self underneath adaptive defenses. But personally? I don't think I've ever actually trusted that there's anything solid underneath my competence. I've just... kept building.",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I drop from my head into my body without immediately analyzing what I find there\n2. I welcome discovering what exists underneath my professional scaffolding\n3. I trust that something authentic lives beneath my competence\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "The first one\u2014the dropping from head into body without analyzing\u2014 that's the one that makes my chest get tight and my breathing go shallow. It's like my entire nervous system recognizes that as the most dangerous possibility. \n\nActually, can I adjust the language slightly? Instead of \"I drop from my head into my body,\" maybe \"I practice dropping from my head into my body\" or \"I allow myself to drop...\" Because the truth is, I don't know if I *can* actually do it yet. The idea of just *dropping* without the practicing or allowing feels... impossible. Like asking me to spontaneously start speaking fluent Mandarin.\n\nThe second one about welcoming what exists underneath\u2014God, that feels important too, but in a different way. Less immediate panic, more like this deep ache of recognition. Like I've been avoiding that question my entire life.\n\nShould we start with the first one since it's clearly the most charged? Though I'm already aware I'm trying to optimize the sequence, which is probably another form of intellectual control.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I practice dropping from my head into my body without immediately analyzing what I find there\"\n\nThe shift from \"I drop\" to \"I practice dropping\" - that's your wisdom speaking. You know this isn't about forcing a breakthrough, it's about learning to allow something new.\n\nHow does the second one land? \"I welcome discovering what exists underneath my professional scaffolding\"",
  "user5": "*I'm noticing my jaw just clenched...* and there I go again with the observing instead of answering.\n\nThe second one lands like... hope and terror in equal measure. There's this part of me that's desperately curious about what's actually underneath\u2014all these years of being the competent therapist, the reliable one, the person who always knows what to say. Like maybe there's something more authentic, more... I don't know... *real* underneath all this performance.\n\nBut welcoming it? That feels like inviting an earthquake into my carefully constructed life. And I think that's the part that terrifies me most\u2014not just discovering there's nothing there, but discovering there *is* something there that's been buried under decades of competence. Something that might need things I've spent my entire life learning not to need. Something that might be... what? Needy? Vulnerable? Dependent? All the things I help my clients embrace but can't seem to allow in myself.\n\nActually, the language feels right. \"Welcome\" is gentler than \"force\" or \"make happen.\" It's more like... opening a door I've been barricading my whole life and seeing what wants to come through. Even thinking about it makes me feel this strange mix of nausea and... is that excitement? God, I can't even tell anymore.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I welcome discovering what exists underneath my professional scaffolding\"\n\nThat mix of nausea and excitement - your body knows you're touching something real.\n\nHow about the third? \"I trust that something authentic lives beneath my competence\"",
  "user6": "That one's... harder. Not because it doesn't feel true\u2014intellectually I know it is, I've seen it with clients, I've read all the research about the authentic self underneath adaptive defenses\u2014but because \"trust\" feels like such a stretch. \n\nActually, can we soften it? Instead of \"I trust,\" maybe \"I'm learning to trust\" or even \"I'm open to discovering that something authentic lives beneath my competence.\" Because the truth is, I don't *know* if there's anything authentic down there. I've been the competent one for so long that I can't even imagine what an authentic Rebecca would look like without all the therapeutic frameworks and clinical language and meta-analysis.\n\nThere's this fear that if I peel back the competence, there won't be anything left\u2014that maybe I'm just... empty. A collection of skills and knowledge without any real self underneath. And I think that's why the third intention feels impossible to say with certainty. I'm willing to be *open* to discovering there's something real underneath. I'm willing to *learn* to trust that I won't just dissolve into nothingness if the scaffolding falls away. But blind trust? That feels like asking me to jump off a cliff when I'm not convinced there's ground underneath.\n\nDoes that make sense? I'm aware I'm probably overthinking this, but the language feels important\u2014like I need to be honest about what I can actually commit to instead of what I *should* feel.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I'm open to discovering that something authentic lives beneath my competence\"\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n1. I practice dropping from my head into my body without immediately analyzing what I find there\n2. I welcome discovering what exists underneath my professional scaffolding  \n3. I'm open to discovering that something authentic lives beneath my competence\n\nHow do you want to keep these close when the intellectualizing starts?",
  "user7": "*I'm noticing this strange mix of relief and terror...* like having these named makes them more real and therefore more dangerous.\n\nActually, I was thinking about this\u2014there's that research from Johns Hopkins about how intention-setting can shape psychedelic experiences, but there's also this delicate balance where if I turn these into another optimization project, I'm missing the point entirely. Which is exactly what I tend to do with everything.\n\nMaybe something simple? Like writing them on an index card I keep in my wallet, or setting them as a daily phone reminder? Though I'm already picturing myself analyzing whether I'm \"doing the intentions right,\" which is... God, so perfectly me.\n\nActually, what if I put them somewhere I can't avoid but also can't perform? Like on my bathroom mirror where I'll see them when I'm barely awake, or as the lock screen on my phone so I have to see them before I can check Twitter or email? Something that interrupts the automatic analysis without becoming another thing to perfect.\n\nOr maybe\u2014this feels a little embarrassing to admit\u2014I could record myself reading them and listen during my morning walk to the office? That 15-minute walk is usually when I'm planning my sessions, running through client cases, so it's already this liminal space between home and work, between my personal self and my therapist self.\n\nWhat do you think? I'm aware I'm probably overthinking the overthinking about overthinking at this point.",
  "system8": "That walk to the office - that's your liminal space where the shift happens. Put them there. Listen to yourself reading them during those 15 minutes when you're transitioning between Rebecca the person and Rebecca the therapist.\n\nYour ritual: Phone recording of your voice reading the intentions, morning walk to office. Simple. Interrupts the pattern without becoming another performance to perfect.\n\nYou've got your compass. Three weeks. Trust what emerges.",
  "user8": "*I'm noticing tears behind my eyes...* and there I go observing the tears instead of feeling them. But yeah, that walk\u2014when I'm neither fully myself nor fully the therapist, just this in-between space where I usually fill the silence with case planning and theoretical frameworks. It feels... right. Dangerous, but right.\n\nThe recording thing actually makes my chest tight in this way that tells me it's exactly what I need to do. Because I'll hate hearing my own voice, and I'll want to edit it, and I'll probably re-record it seventeen times trying to get the \"perfect\" inflection on \"discovering.\" Which is the whole practice, isn't it? Just reading them badly, imperfectly, and letting that be enough.\n\nThree weeks. I'm scared I'll forget, scared I'll do it \"wrong,\" scared I'll intellectualize even this simple practice. But I'm also... what is this feeling? Hope? It feels fragile and dangerous and maybe unnecessary. But it's there.\n\nActually, I should probably tell you\u2014I'm probably going to report back to you about how the walk-recording thing went, and I'll probably analyze whether I'm doing it right, and you'll probably have to remind me that noticing I'm analyzing is part of the practice too.",
  "system9": "That's the practice - notice the analyzing, notice the re-recording seventeen times, notice the chest tightness. Then keep walking anyway.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user9": "Keep walking anyway. Yeah. That's the part I always miss\u2014the not fixing, the not optimizing, the just... continuing while everything in me screams to stop and perfect.\n\nI think I'm actually going to do this. Which is a terrifying thing to say out loud, because now I've committed to it and I can't pretend I'm just \"thinking about\" preparing anymore.\n\nThree weeks. Walking with these intentions, probably analyzing whether I'm noticing the analyzing, definitely re-recording that audio, maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014dropping into my body for thirty seconds during minute twelve of the walk.\n\nThank you. For helping me find something that feels both impossible and absolutely necessary.",
  "system10": "You're set. Trust what emerges.",
  "user10": "*I'm noticing this strange quiet in my chest...* not the usual anxious hum, but something softer. More like possibility than panic.\n\nTrust what emerges. I'll probably be analyzing what emerges while it's emerging, trying to categorize whether it's authentic enough, wondering if I'm doing the trusting right. But maybe that's okay too. Maybe the part that analyzes the trusting is also part of what needs to be trusted.\n\nThree weeks. Walking with my imperfect voice reading imperfect intentions, practicing not-perfecting. Letting the Boston morning light hit my face while I try to drop into the body that's been carrying all this intellectual weight for forty-six years.\n\nThank you. For witnessing this part of the process\u2014the part where I shift from \"preparing to prepare\" to actually having a practice. I'll probably check in with you about how terrible the audio sounds, but... I'm going to do it.",
  "system11": "Three weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user11": "Three weeks. Walking with my three intentions, morning after morning, whether I want to or not. Whether I \"do it right\" or not. Whether I trust the process or not.\n\nI've got my compass. Now I just have to walk.",
  "system12": "Now you just walk.",
  "user12": "Now I just walk.\n\n*I'm noticing my throat feels tight...* and I'm going to keep walking anyway.",
  "system13": "Keep walking.",

  "user14": "Morning after morning. Step after step.\n\nEven when the alarm goes off at 5:45 and I\u2019d rather stay in bed analyzing my dreams than face the cold Brookline air.

Step after step.\n\nMy voice stumbling over the intentions I wrote, my chest tight with the effort of not perfecting the audio, my legs carrying me past the Booksmith and the coffee shop and all the familiar places where I usually live in my head instead of my body.\n\nMorning after morning.

However many steps it takes.\n\nTo maybe\u2014maybe\u2014learn how to be in my body while it\u2019s moving through the world.
