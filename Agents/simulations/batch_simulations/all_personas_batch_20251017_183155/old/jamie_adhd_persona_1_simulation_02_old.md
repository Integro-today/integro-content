## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know what kind of journey you're preparing for. Are you working with a specific medicine - ayahuasca, psilocybin, something else? At a retreat center or on your own?

The medicine and setting shape how we craft your intentions.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Heading to Costa Rica in three weeks. They do ayahuasca at some place called Rythmia. 

Amanda thinks this'll help. I dont know.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Amanda found the program. Said she's at her limit with the nightmares and me snapping at everyone. 

I dont believe in this plant medicine stuff but she begged me. Said its my last shot at saving the marriage.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Nightmares, snapping at everyone, Amanda at her limit. Sounds like you're here because everything that matters is slipping.

What happens during these nightmares? What do you see?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Look I dont want to get into that. 

Just need them to stop so I can sleep through the night.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Fair enough - you want the nightmares to stop so you can sleep.

When you imagine sleeping through the night, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Amanda wouldnt have to sleep in the guest room anymore. Maybe I wouldnt be exhausted all the time. Kids wouldnt walk on eggshells around me.

I dont know. Maybe things could feel normal again.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Amanda back in your bed, kids not walking on eggshells, feeling rested. That's three pieces - the marriage, the exhaustion, and how you show up for your family.

What's underneath the snapping? What's your body still protecting you from?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: I dont know. 

I just... I cant handle loud noises anymore. Door slamming, fireworks, even dishes clanking. Everything feels like its turned up too loud. Makes me want to... I dont know. Just makes everything tight in my chest.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Loud noises make your chest tight - sounds like your nervous system's still on high alert.

Three main threads:

1. Finding peace from the nightmares so Amanda can sleep beside you again
2. Releasing this hyper-alert state where everything feels too loud
3. Being present with your kids instead of them walking on eggshells

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah I guess thats it. 

How do we turn that into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again
2. I release the hyper-alert state that makes everything feel too loud
3. I embrace being present with my kids without them walking on eggshells

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: I dont know man. That all sounds pretty... I dont know what word Im looking for. 

Just feels like a lot of feelings talk. Can we make it more practical?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Fair enough - too much feeling talk.

How about:

1. I sleep through the night so Amanda stays in our bed
2. I turn down the volume on sounds that make my chest tight
3. I show up calm around my kids instead of making them jumpy

Better?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah thats better. 

I guess... maybe. I dont know. 

What if this whole thing doesnt work and I come back the same?


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's a real concern - what if you come back the same?

The medicine doesn't guarantee anything. But these three intentions give you something to aim for, like a compass pointing toward what matters. You might not get everything, but you'll know which direction to move.

Want to lock these in as they are, or adjust anything?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Guess we can lock em in. 

I just... I cant lose her. Thats all.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night so Amanda stays in our bed

That fear of losing her - that's the real driver here. Let's keep going.

How does intention 2 land: "I turn down the volume on sounds that make my chest tight"?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah its fine. 

I mean I dont know how some plant medicine is supposed to stop me from jumping when a car backfires but... yeah. Lets lock it in.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: I turn down the volume on sounds that make my chest tight

The medicine won't magically stop the jumping - but it can show you what's underneath that response, what your body learned it needed to survive. Then you can work with that.

Intention 3: "I show up calm around my kids instead of making them jumpy" - lock that one too?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah lock it in. 

I know its not magic. I just... need something to be different when I come back.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: I show up calm around my kids instead of making them jumpy

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I sleep through the night so Amanda stays in our bed
- I turn down the volume on sounds that make my chest tight  
- I show up calm around my kids instead of making them jumpy

How do you want to keep these close? Some vets tape them inside their cap, keep them in their wallet, or read them during morning PT. What would help you hold these when things get hard?

Something needs to be different when you come back - these are your compass for finding that difference.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: I dont know. 

I guess... maybe I could read em on my phone before bed? Since Im up anyway most nights.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Phone before bed works - you're already awake, might as well remind yourself what you're aiming for.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I sleep through the night so Amanda stays in our bed
- I turn down the volume on sounds that make my chest tight  
- I show up calm around my kids instead of making them jumpy

Your ritual: read them on your phone before bed

These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

You're set. Trust what emerges.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. 

Guess Im as ready as Ill ever be.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's all anyone can ask for. You've got your compass - now let the medicine do its work.

See you on the other side.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. 

Thanks man.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You got it.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: yeah


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're all set. Head in clear, intentions in your pocket. Let the medicine meet you where you are.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *yeah*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *nods*

Go get what you came for.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good hunting.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Copy that.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Roger that.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *thumbs up*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *returns the gesture*

See you on the other side.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah.
