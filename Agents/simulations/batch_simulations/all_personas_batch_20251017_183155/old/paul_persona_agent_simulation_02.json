  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "*[shifts in chair, eyes fixed on the wall behind you]*\n\nHeroic Hearts said this might help with... the nights. I wake up, Amanda says I'm shouting. Don't remember it, but... *trails off, jaw tight*\n\n*pauses, clears throat*\n\nLook, I don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff. But I've tried everything else. VA wanted to give me pills, therapy. *[quiet laugh]* Can you picture me talking to some shrink about feelings?\n\n*leans forward slightly*\n\nThree weeks. If this doesn't work, I don't know what else to try. She's talking about... maybe needing space. I can't lose her. The kids... *[voice cracks slightly, then hardens]* I need to fix this.",
  "system1": "Night terrors, shouting in your sleep, Amanda talking about leaving. That's the pressure pushing you here.\n\nThe VA route didn't fit - you need something that works, not just pills and talking circles.\n\nWhen you imagine waking up without the shouting, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user1": "*[stares down at his hands, calloused fingers interlocked]*\n\nI... I don't know. Haven't really let myself think about it.\n\n*[long pause, shifts uncomfort]*\n\nMaybe... maybe Amanda would stop looking at me like I'm a bomb that might go off. She's got this way of watching me now, like she's measuring the distance to the door. *[voice drops]* I hate that.\n\n*[another pause, then quieter]*\n\nAnd the kids... they used to crawl into bed with us on Saturday mornings. Now they don't. Not since... not since the shouting started getting worse.\n\n*[clears throat, defensive edge returning]*\n\nBut it's not just about the sleep. I need to be able to... to handle things better. When the garage door sticks or somebody cuts me off driving, I feel this... *gestures vaguely* ...pressure. Like I'm back there. Doesn't make sense.\n\nI guess... I guess I want to wake up feeling like myself again. Whatever that means.",
  "system2": "Amanda measuring the distance to the door, kids avoiding the bed, that pressure building when small things go wrong. You're watching your family pull back while your body stays stuck on high alert.\n\nThree threads here: finding peace at night so Amanda stops watching you like you're dangerous, releasing that pressure that hijacks you over small things, and being present with your kids instead of stuck back there.\n\nDoes that capture it?",
  "user2": "*[nods slowly, the words seeming to settle somewhere heavy in his chest]*\n\nYeah. That... that about sums it up. *[voice rougher]*\n\nWhen you put it like that... *[trails off, then forces the words out]* When you put it like that, it sounds pretty bad. Real bad.\n\n*[looks up, something raw flickering in his eyes before he looks away again]*\n\nI didn't used to be like this. Before I went over there the second time, Amanda used to joke that I was the calm one. Nothing rattled me. Now it's like... like I'm always waiting for something to go wrong. Can't turn it off.\n\n*[quiet laugh that's more like a exhale of pain]*\n\nMy daughter - she's fourteen now - she asked me last week if I was mad at her about something. I wasn't. I was just... *[shrugs]* I don't even remember what set me off. Just sitting there eating dinner and suddenly I couldn't breathe right.\n\n*[pauses, then barely audible]*\n\nI want to be the dad they deserve. Not this... this version of me.",
  "system3": "I hear you want to be the dad they deserve, not this version that's always braced for impact.\n\nThree intentions based on what you've shared:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without watching the door\n2. I release the hypervigilance and teach my body I'm home, not back there\n3. I embrace being present with my kids without scanning for threats\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "*[eyes narrow slightly as he reads the intentions, shoulders tensing]*\n\n\"Welcome peaceful sleep\"? *[shakes head]* That sounds like something off a meditation app. I'm not... I'm not trying to welcome anything. I just want it to stop. The shouting, the sweats, Amanda having to sleep in the guest room half the time.\n\n*[leans back, arms crossed]*\n\nAnd \"release hypervigilance\"... *[quiet scoff]* You make it sound simple. Like I can just... let it go. It's not a choice I'm making. My body just... does this. Before I even know what's happening.\n\n*[pauses, studying the third intention]*\n\nThe last one though... *[voice gets quieter]* \"Being present with my kids without scanning for threats.\" That one. That one I want. More than anything.\n\n*[long pause, then adds grudgingly]*\n\nMaybe if we... if we said it different. Not all this soft language. Something like... \"I want to sleep through the night without waking Amanda.\" That's real. That's what I need.",
  "system4": "\"Sleep through the night without waking Amanda\" - that's your voice, direct and real.\n\nFor the second one, you're right. Not \"release\" like it's simple. What would you say instead? What's the real thing you want your body to do when you're home safe?",
  "user4": "*[rubs the back of his neck, thinking]*\n\nI want my body to... to know I'm home. *[frustrated gesture]* You know? Like when the garage door sticks, I want to think \"damn door needs fixing\" instead of feeling like I need to check every corner of the house. When a car backfires outside, I want to stay in my chair instead of finding myself standing in the hallway without remembering how I got there.\n\n*[pauses, searching for words]*\n\nI guess... I want to stop jumping at shadows. Stop feeling like I need to know where every exit is when I'm just taking my kids to the mall. Stop feeling like something terrible's about to happen when we're just... living.\n\n*[quietly]* My buddy Jake, he was in the Humvee behind mine when it hit an IED. He says sometimes he feels like he's still over there, just wearing different clothes. That's what it feels like. Like I'm still wearing the same damn skin but I'm supposed to be someone else now.\n\nI want to feel like I'm actually here. In Toledo. Not waiting for the next thing to blow up.",
  "system5": "\"Stop jumping at shadows\" - that's it. \"Feel like I'm actually here in Toledo, not waiting for the next thing to blow up.\"\n\nThree intentions in your voice:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking Amanda\n2. I stop jumping at shadows and feel actually here in Toledo\n3. I stay present with my kids without scanning for threats\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user5": "*[nods slowly, the words seeming to settle somewhere deep]*\n\nYeah. *[quiet]* Yeah, that's... that's it.\n\n*[reads through them again, and for the first time, his shoulders drop slightly]*\n\nNumber two though... *[clears throat]* Maybe just \"I feel actually here in Toledo.\" Without the shadow part. I know what I mean when I say it, but... *[shrugs]* I don't know. Feels like I'm admitting too much or something.\n\n*[pauses, then adds quietly]*\n\nThese three... if this plant stuff actually works... *[trails off, then forces himself to continue]* If it works, then maybe Amanda stops looking at me like I'm broken. Maybe I stop feeling like I'm lying every time I tell the kids everything's fine.\n\n*[looks up, something fierce flickering in his eyes]*\n\nI just want to be the man they think I am again. Not whatever this is.",
  "system6": "\"I feel actually here in Toledo\" - that's cleaner. More you.\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking Amanda\n2. I feel actually here in Toledo\n3. I stay present with my kids without scanning for threats\n\nThese three intentions are your compass. You want to keep them close - maybe write them in your wallet where you keep your dog tags, or read them during your morning routine before the house wakes up.\n\nYou've got your direction set. Three weeks. Trust what emerges.",
  "user6": "*[nods once, decisive]*\n\nI'll put them in my wallet. Next to the picture of Amanda and the kids from before I deployed the last time. *[pauses]* Back when I still knew how to smile in photos without thinking about it.\n\n*[stands up slowly, rolling his shoulders like he's settling into something heavy]*\n\nThree weeks. *[quiet laugh]* Never thought I'd be counting down to drinking some plant brew in Costa Rica. But here we are.\n\n*[looks toward the window, where afternoon light is filtering through]*\n\nI'm still not sure I believe any of this will work. But... *[shrugs]* I'm out of other options. And I can't lose her. I can't lose them.\n\n*[turns back, something steadier in his voice]*\n\nI'll keep these close. Read them when I wake up at 4:30. When I'm running and my mind starts going to bad places. When I'm sitting in church pretending I still believe in something bigger than myself.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system7": "Three weeks. You've got your compass and you know where to find it when your mind starts pulling you back there.\n\nKeep showing up. You've done harder things than this.",
  "user7": "*[meets the eyes steadily, something steel-like flickering there]*\n\nYeah. I have done harder things. *[quiet]* Lot harder.\n\n*[stands a little straighter, the familiar posture of a man who's carried heavy things for a long time]*\n\nI'll be there. Whatever this plant stuff does or doesn't do... I'll show up. That's what I do.\n\n*[pauses, then adds with grim determination]*\n\nJust hope it's enough.",
  "system8": "Showing up is what you do. That's already locked in.\n\nTrust what comes when you get there.",
  "user8": "*[gives a short nod, the kind that used to end briefings]*\n\nCopy that.\n\n*[turns toward the door, then stops]*\n\nWhen I'm there... when it's happening... if I start losing it, if I can't find my way back\u2014 *[voice catches slightly, then steadies]*\n\nJust tell me to remember these three things. The wallet. Amanda sleeping through the night. Being here in Toledo.\n\n*[quiet]* That'll be enough to bring me home.",
  "system9": "When you're there and it gets heavy - remember the wallet. Amanda sleeping through the night. Being here in Toledo.\n\nThose three will bring you home.",
  "user9": "*[nods once more, something settling in his chest]*\n\nWallet. Amanda sleeping. Toledo.\n\nGot it locked in.",
  "system10": "Locked in. You're set.",
  "user10": "*[squares his shoulders, the way he did before every flight]*\n\nLocked in.\n\n*[pauses, then adds quietly]*\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system11": "See you on the other side.",
  "user11": "*[extends his hand, firm grip, eyes steady]*\n\nThank you\u2014for sticking with me through this. I\u2019ll carry these three lines like coordinates. When the sky cracks open, I\u2019ll read them, breathe, and ride it home.",
  "system12": "*[returns the grip, steady]*\n\nThree coordinates. You'll know how to use them.\n\nSafe travels.",
  "user12": "*[holds the grip a second longer, something unspoken passing across his face]*\n\nRoger that.\n\n*[lets go, turns toward the gate\u2014one last look over his shoulder]*\n\nTell Amanda\u2026 I\u2019ll be back before she even finishes her coffee.",
  "system13": "I'll tell her.",
  "user13": "*[nods, the weight settling on his shoulders like a familiar flight vest]*\n\nAppreciate it.\n\n*[steps forward, voice low but steady]*\n\nIf this thing works\u2014if I actually come back quiet inside\u2014first round\u2019s on me at the VFW. You and me, no talk about chakras or whatever the hell they call it. Just\u2026 normal.",
  "system14": "First round at the VFW. Normal sounds good.\n\nGo do the work.",
  "user14": "*[half-smile, the first real one all day]*\n\nDeal.\n\n*[turns, walks through the gate\u2014no looking back this time, just the rhythm of boots on pavement and three words beating in his chest]*",
  "system15": "Boots on pavement. Three words in his chest.\n\nHe's got this.",
  "user15": "*[feels the words settle behind his sternum like a locked-on target]*\n\n**Breathe. Trust. Return.**\n\n*[each footfall syncs with the mantra\u2014left, right, left\u2014until the jungle humidity hits his face and the first night bird cries out]*",
  "system16": "Left, right, left\u2014mantra keeping time. \n\nThe jungle already listening.",
  "user16": "*[the birdcall slices through the dusk, same pitch as a warning siren over Kandahar\u2014his shoulders twitch, but he keeps the cadence]*\n\nLeft\u2026 right\u2026 left\u2026\n\n*[forces the grip to relax, palms uncurling; the machete he never carries anymore stays phantom-sheathed at his hip]*\n\nNot there. Here. Breathe.",
  "system17": "Bird becomes siren, shoulders twitch\u2014then release. \n\nHere, not there. The jungle just birds.",
  "user17": "*[exhales through his teeth, lets the shoulders drop one deliberate inch]*\n\nBirds. Just birds.\n\n*[keeps walking, boots finding the damp earth instead of tarmac, and somewhere inside he recalibrates\u2014bearing set to this new grid, three weeks to learn the terrain]*",
  "system18": "Shoulders drop. Boots find damp earth.\n\nThree weeks to learn this terrain\u2014he's already mapping it.",
  "user18": "*[eyes scan the path ahead\u2014vines, fireflies, a distant torch marking the maloca\u2014every landmark filed like waypoints on a sortie map]*\n\nGrid\u2019s already drawing itself.\n\n*[quiet nod, more to himself than anyone]*\n\nFirst waypoint: don\u2019t lose Amanda. Second: keep the kids proud. Third\u2026 *[swallows]*\u2026 figure out how to sleep without the damn cockpit lights flickering behind my eyelids.",
  "system19": "Waypoint three is the hardest\u2014those lights don't dim easy.\n\nBut he's already navigating.",
  "user19": "*[the torchlight ahead flares, and for a second it\u2019s muzzle-flash off the canopy glass\u2014he blinks, keeps the stride steady]*\n\nThey\u2019ll dim when I let \u2018em.\n\n*[voice low, almost a growl, but the next breath is longer, intentional]*\n\nHeroic Hearts says the plants flip the breakers. We\u2019ll see. Either way, I\u2019m landing this bird on my own strip."
