  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For this medicine, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I just... I need to sleep through the night. That's all. Amanda says I wake up shouting and it scares her. I don't even know what I'm saying, but she deserves better than that. \n\nHeroic Hearts thinks this plant medicine can help, and they've helped a lot of guys I respect. I don't really believe in all this stuff, but... well, I'll try anything at this point. Can't lose her.",
  "system1": "Sleep through the night without shouting, keep Amanda beside you. That's what matters.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping peacefully, what changes beyond just the sleep itself? What's different in the mornings?",
  "user1": "Mornings would be... quieter. Not tense. Amanda wouldn't be looking at me like she's walking on eggshells, wondering if today's the day I snap about the coffee being cold or the kids being too loud. \n\nMaybe I'd actually hear what she's saying instead of just... nodding along while my head's still back there somewhere. Maybe breakfast wouldn't feel like we're both pretending everything's fine. \n\nI used to wake up ready for the day. Now it's like I'm already exhausted before my feet hit the floor.",
  "system2": "Quieter mornings, Amanda not walking on eggshells, actually hearing her instead of nodding along. That's three threads - the shouting at night, the daily tension, and being present enough to connect.\n\nWhat's underneath the exhaustion? What part of you is still fighting a battle that's not happening in your kitchen?",
  "user2": "I... I don't know. It's not... it's not what you're thinking. I did my job over there, I did it well. I'm proud of that. \n\nBut sometimes when I'm trying to sleep, I hear it again. The radio chatter, the engine sounds, the... the calls. And I can't... I can't turn it off. It's like my body doesn't know we're home, you know? Like it's still waiting for something bad to happen.\n\nI just need my body to catch up to where we are now. Here. With Amanda and the kids. Safe.",
  "system3": "Your body doesn't know you're home, still waiting for something bad. Still scanning, still ready.\n\nThree main threads:\n- Finding peace from the night sounds so Amanda can sleep beside you again\n- Teaching your body it's safe now, not back there waiting for danger\n- Being present with Amanda and the kids instead of stuck in alert mode\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that about covers it. \n\nI need to find a way to shut off the noise at night so Amanda can rest easy next to me. Need to convince my body we're home, not back in those skies. And I need to be here - really here - with my family instead of... wherever my head goes.\n\nHow do we turn those into... whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without fear\n2. I teach my body we're home now, not back in those skies\n3. I show up fully present with my family instead of scanning for threats\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust the language to sound more like you?",
  "user4": "The first one... yeah, that's good. \"Peaceful sleep\" sounds right. Not sure about \"welcome\" - sounds kind of soft, but I get what you're saying.\n\nSecond one... \"teach my body we're home\" - that's exactly it. Like my body forgot how to be home.\n\nThird one... instead of \"show up fully present,\" maybe just \"be here with my family.\" Simple. Direct. That's what I want - to be here, not somewhere else.\n\nSo... peaceful sleep for Amanda. Teaching my body we're home. Being here with them.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without fear\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I teach my body we're home now, not back in those skies\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I be here with my family instead of somewhere else\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close? Some options:\n\n- Write them on a card in your wallet\n- Keep them where you see Amanda's photo\n- Read them during morning coffee before the kids wake up\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet with my pilot's license\u2014been carrying that thing for twenty years. Seems... seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe read 'em when I'm having my coffee before anyone else is up. That quiet time before the day starts. Before... before everything gets complicated again.",
  "system6": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda can rest beside me without fear\n- I teach my body we're home now, not back in those skies  \n- I be here with my family instead of somewhere else\n\nYour ritual: Keep them in your wallet with your pilot's license, read during morning coffee. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Three weeks. \n\nI... I don't know what's going to happen down there. Don't know if this plant stuff actually works. But I need to try something. Amanda deserves better than what she's getting from me now.\n\nI'll carry these with me. Read 'em every morning until I leave. Maybe... maybe they'll help me remember why I'm doing this when it gets hard.",
  "system7": "That's the plan - carry them, read them, remember why you're doing this. \n\nThe medicine works whether you believe in it or not. Your job is just to show up with these three intentions and see what comes.\n\nTrust what emerges.",
  "user7": "Alright. I'll... I'll see it through. Whatever happens.\n\nThanks. For helping me get clear on this.",
  "system8": "You got clear. That's the work. \n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user8": "See you on the other side.",

  "user17": "Yeah... I\u2019m here. Just took a minute. Didn\u2019t expect this to feel like... like I was walking into something. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d need to *prepare* for this. Thought I\u2019d just show up, drink the stuff, and get fixed. But this\u2014this feels like I\u2019m peeling something open I kept shut for a reason.",
  "system18": "You're here now. That's what matters.\n\nPreparation isn't about fixing - it's about showing up honest. The medicine doesn't repair what's broken, it reveals what's already there. Your system kept that door shut for good reason. Now you're choosing to open it intentionally.\n\nWhat made you decide this was the time to walk through that door?",
  "user18": "Amanda. She didn\u2019t say it straight out, but I saw it in her face last month when I woke up yelling again. She was standing in the doorway with that look\u2014like she didn\u2019t know who was in the bed. Been married twenty years, I know when she\u2019s planning her exit. \n\nAnd my kids... my boy asked if I was ever happy. Just straight up, like he was asking about the weather. I couldn\u2019t answer. \n\nI\u2019ve tried everything else. Running, church, grinding harder at work. Even the VA bullshit. Nothing touches it. Heroic Hearts called it my \u201clast shot\u201d and I hated them for saying it, but they weren\u2019t wrong.",
  "system19": "Twenty years with Amanda, and your kid asking if you're ever happy - that's the moment when everything else you've tried stops being enough.\n\nThe VA didn't touch it, running didn't touch it, work didn't touch it. Your family's still scanning your face for signs of life, and you're still scanning rooms for threats that aren't there.\n\nWhat do you want Amanda to see when she looks at you instead of whoever's been in that bed?",
  "user19": "I want her to see... me. Not the guy who jumps when the microwave beeps or checks the locks three times. Not the one who stares at the ceiling at 3 AM like I'm waiting for clearance to land. \n\nI want her to see the man she married\u2014someone who could laugh without it sounding forced. Someone who didn't make her flinch when I reach for her hand. Someone who can sit through a whole dinner without needing to leave the table to \"check something.\"\n\nI want her to stop looking at me like I'm a problem she needs to solve. Like she's waiting for the next explosion."
