  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your psychedelic journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep better, stop waking up the whole house with... whatever. So here I am. I can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Heroic Hearts sent you here for sleep, for keeping the house quiet. That tells me nights are rough right now.\n\nWhen you wake the house - what's happening in those moments? Are you waking yourself up too, or just everyone else?",
  "user1": "Yeah, I'm waking up too. Drenched in sweat, heart racing like I just ran a marathon. Sometimes it's the explosions, sometimes it's... other stuff. Amanda says I shout things, but I never remember what. She keeps asking me to talk about it, but what am I supposed to say? I don't even know what I'm saying when I'm asleep.",
  "system2": "You're drenched in sweat, heart racing, shouting things you don't remember. Amanda wants answers you don't have.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night without the explosions or whatever else comes, what would change for you beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user2": "Everything would change. I could... I don't know, maybe I could actually sit still without feeling like I need to move, do something, fix something. Maybe Amanda would stop looking at me like I'm about to break. Maybe I could stop feeling like I need to drink three Scotches just to maybe get four hours of sleep. Maybe my kids wouldn't ask why daddy's so tired all the time.",
  "system3": "Everything would change - sitting still without that restless edge, Amanda not watching you like you're fragile, skipping the Scotch just to maybe sleep, your kids not asking why daddy's always tired.\n\nThree threads here:\n1. Finding peace from whatever's hijacking your nights so you can rest\n2. Releasing that restless need to always be moving/fixing \n3. Being present with Amanda and the kids instead of exhausted and on edge\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that about covers it. I just... I need to be able to shut it off when I walk through my front door. The insurance business, the bills, all that stuff - that's fine. But when I'm home, I need to be home. Not still flying missions in my head. Not still waiting for something to go wrong.\n\nI need to figure out how to be the man they think I am, not... this.",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so I can be present with Amanda and the kids\n2. I release the restless edge that keeps me moving when I should be still\n3. I embrace being home - not flying missions in my head, not waiting for threats\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language to match your voice better?",
  "user4": "The first one - about peaceful sleep so I can be present. That's... that's what I need. But \"welcome peaceful sleep\" sounds too soft. I don't need to welcome anything - I need to face whatever this is and make it stop. \n\nHow about... \"I face what haunts my nights so I can show up for Amanda and the kids.\" Something like that? I don't know. This intention stuff feels backwards to me.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I face what haunts my nights so I can show up for Amanda and the kids\"\n\nThat shift from \"welcome\" to \"face\" - that's your voice. Direct, no softness.\n\nHow about the other two? \"Release the restless edge\" and \"embrace being home\" - do those need the same kind of steel?",
  "user5": "Yeah, they do. \"Release the restless edge\" sounds like yoga class or something. I need something stronger. How about... \"I stop running from the silence so I can finally sit still.\" \n\nAnd for the home one - \"I leave the missions behind when I walk through my door.\" That's clearer. No fluffy stuff.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I stop running from the silence so I can finally sit still\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I leave the missions behind when I walk through my door\"\n\nThree solid intentions. How do you want to keep these close when things get hard? Some options:\n\n- Tape them to your bathroom mirror where you see them every morning\n- Keep them in your wallet with your pilot's license\n- Read them during your pre-flight routine (but for coming home instead)\n\nWhat would help you hold these when the nights get rough?",
  "user6": "My wallet. I've been carrying the same one since basic - it's worn, beat to hell, but it's mine. Keeps everything important close. These intentions... they're going in there with my license and that picture of Amanda from before we got married. \n\nI'll read them when I'm sitting in the parking lot at work, before I walk through the door to go home. Like a pre-flight checklist, but for being a husband and father instead of a pilot.",
  "system7": "Your 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I face what haunts my nights so I can show up for Amanda and the kids\n- I stop running from the silence so I can finally sit still  \n- I leave the missions behind when I walk through my door\n\nYour ritual: In your wallet with that worn license and Amanda's photo. Pre-flight checklist before walking through your front door.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user7": "Got it. Three weeks. I'll... I'll see this through. For Amanda. For the kids. Maybe for myself too, if I'm being honest. \n\nThanks for helping me get this straight in my head. I don't know what the hell I'm walking into, but at least I know why I'm walking into it.",
  "system8": "You know why you're walking in. That's enough for now.\n\nTrust what emerges.",
  "user8": "Roger that.",
  "system9": "*nods*\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user9": "Copy that.",
  "system10": "*quiet acknowledgment*\n\nYou're set.",
  "user10": "Yeah. I am.",
  "system11": "Good.",
  "user11": "Hey... one more thing. When I'm down there\u2014Costa Rica\u2014if I... if things get heavy, and I need to reach out to Amanda but I can't find the words, what do I say? I don't want her thinking I broke down or lost it.",
  "system12": "Tell her: *\"I'm working through something important here. It's hard to explain right now, but I'm safe and this is part of getting right. I'll call when I can speak clearer.\"*\n\nKeep it simple. She'll understand you're doing the work.",
  "user12": "Got it. Simple. No need to over-explain. Just... doing the work. Thanks.",
  "system13": "Exactly.",
  "user13": "Yeah. That works.",
  "system14": "*quiet nod*\n\nYou're good to go.",
