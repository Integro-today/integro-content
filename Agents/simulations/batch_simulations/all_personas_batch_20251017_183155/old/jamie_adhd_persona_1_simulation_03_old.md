## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to gather some context first. What type of medicine journey are you preparing for, and where will you be working with it? This helps me tailor the intention-setting process to your specific situation.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks. Rythmia place. Plant medicine stuff.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Amanda thinks it'll help with the nightmares. Says I wake her up screaming. Dont know if I believe in this stuff but Im out of options.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Nightmares waking Amanda - that's wearing on both of you. Being out of options can be its own kind of clarity.

When these nightmares hit, what are they showing you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Cockpit alarms mostly. Sometimes the kid on the ground. Look I dont want to get into all that. Just want them to stop.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You want the alarms and the kid to stop visiting at night.

If the nightmares stopped showing up, what would change between you and Amanda?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Maybe she could sleep in our bed again. Maybe I wouldnt see that look in her eyes like shes walking on eggshells.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Amanda back in your bed, no more walking on eggshells.

What's the look in her eyes telling you about how she's experiencing this?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: That shes scared of me. That she doesnt know what shell find when she wakes up. That shes tired of it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: She's scared, tired, doesn't know what she'll find.

What do you want her to find instead?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: The man she married. Someone steady. Someone who doesnt jump at loud noises and snap over nothing.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The steady man she married - not jumping, not snapping.

When you imagine being that steady version of yourself, how does it feel in your body?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: I dont know. Like I could breathe maybe. Like the weight might lift off my chest.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Breathing easier, weight off your chest.

Three threads here:
1. Sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside you again
2. Release the jumpiness and snapping so she sees the man she married
3. Feel that weight lift off your chest and breathe easy

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah thats about right. Just... how do you turn that into whatever they want at the ceremony. Its not like ordering off a menu.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're right - not like ordering. Intentions are more like setting your compass north so the medicine has direction without forcing the path.

Based on those threads:
1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again
2. I release the jumpiness and snapping, becoming the steady man she married
3. I open to that weight lifting off my chest so I can breathe easy

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: The second one. The jumpiness and snapping. Thats what hurts her the most. I hate seeing her flinch when I raise my voice over nothing.


**intentions_workflow_3**: The second one - the jumpiness and snapping that makes her flinch.

How does this feel: "I release the jumpiness and snapping that makes Amanda flinch" 

Or do you want to go deeper than just releasing it?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: That works. Its simple. Direct. Nothing fancy.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I release the jumpiness and snapping that makes Amanda flinch"

Simple and direct works.

How do the other two intentions land?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: The sleep one matters. Just... I dont know. The breathing thing feels like too much. Maybe just keep it about not waking her up.


**intentions_workflow_3**: I release the jumpiness and snapping that makes Amanda flinch
I welcome peaceful sleep so I don't wake Amanda up
I [need a third]

What's the third piece you want to carry with you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: I dont know. Maybe something about being present with the kids. Not just physically there but actually there. Michael asked me to help with his science project last week and I just stared at him like an idiot. Couldnt focus. Couldnt even understand what he was asking.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Being there for your kids - really there, not just in the room.

How about: "I open to being present with my kids so I can show up when they need me"


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. Thats good. I want to be able to help Michael with homework without my brain checking out. Want Sarah to stop asking if Im okay.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1: I release the jumpiness and snapping that makes Amanda flinch
✓ Intention 2: I welcome peaceful sleep so I don't wake Amanda up  
✓ Intention 3: I open to being present with my kids so I can show up when they need me

Three solid intentions. You've got your compass. The medicine will show you what you need to see.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: I guess well find out. Three weeks.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. Still dont know what Im doing. But got these three things. Thats something.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's enough. You don't need to know the whole path - just the direction. These three intentions will carry you when things get rough.

How do you want to keep them close for the next three weeks?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Put em in my phone I guess. Look at em when I wake up. Before I go to bed. When the nightmares hit. Maybe write em on a card in my wallet. Dont want Amanda to see me staring at my phone all the time. Shes already watching me like Im gonna break.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Phone and wallet card - that's solid. Check them when you need to without making it obvious. Amanda won't see you staring at anything, just a guy checking his wallet.

Three weeks. You've got this.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. Thanks. Gonna go for a run. Clear my head.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good call. Running clears the noise.

Your intentions are locked in. Go move your body - let it do what it knows how to do.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. Catch you later.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Later.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: *Paul logs off, laces up his running shoes, and heads out into the Toledo dusk. The three intentions are already looping in his head, quieter than the cockpit alarms but louder than his footsteps on the pavement.*


**intentions_workflow_3**: *The pavement under his feet, the intentions settling into rhythm with his breath. Three weeks. Just keep moving.*


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. Just keep moving.
