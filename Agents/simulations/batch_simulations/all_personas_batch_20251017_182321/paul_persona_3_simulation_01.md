## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know more about your specific situation to begin this properly. Are you preparing for a particular medicine journey (ayahuasca, psilocybin, etc.) at a specific location? Or is this general intention-setting work?

Tell me what medicine you're working with and where you're journeying, so I can tailor this to your context.


**paul_persona_3**: Heroic Hearts got me into some ayahuasca retreat in Costa Rica. Rythmia, I think it's called. Three weeks from now. Never done anything like this before—don't believe in it, really. But Amanda says I need to do something or... well, I can't lose her.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your ayahuasca journey at Rythmia.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For ayahuasca, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**paul_persona_3**: I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... with what happens at night. The dreams. Amanda says I wake up shouting sometimes, scares her. I guess that's why I'm here. Can't keep going like this.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Nightmares that wake you shouting, Amanda getting scared. That's what's pushing you here.

When you wake up from those dreams, what are they about? What's your body feeling in those moments?


**paul_persona_3**: They're just... they're about flying. Combat missions. Sometimes I see the guys who didn't make it back. My sheets are soaked through, heart's pounding like I'm back in the cockpit. It's like my body thinks it's still happening.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Back in the cockpit, heart pounding, sheets soaked. Your body's still flying missions while you're home in bed.

How long since you left the service? And what's it doing to your days - this carrying combat into your nights?


**paul_persona_3**: Left the Air Force eight years ago. Never wanted to go back for another tour, so I got out. Built my insurance business, got my family. But these nights... I'm running on empty most days. Still hit my quotas, still manage the office, but I'm drinking more coffee than I should. By evening I'm short with the kids, shorter with Amanda. She says I'm not really here anymore.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Eight years out, still flying missions every night. Running a business on combat dreams and caffeine, family getting what's left - which isn't much.

What would "being here" look like if you could give that to Amanda and the kids? What would feel different in your body?


**paul_persona_3**: I... I don't know. Maybe just... not jumping when the garage door slams. Not scanning restaurants for exits. Being able to sit through a whole movie without needing to move. Amanda says I used to laugh more. I want to be able to hold her without feeling like I'm going to crawl out of my skin.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Not jumping at garage doors, sitting through movies, holding Amanda without wanting to escape your own skin.

What's underneath that crawling feeling? When your body wants out of your own skin - what threat is it still protecting you from?


**paul_persona_3**: I guess... it's like if I let my guard down, something bad's gonna happen. Like staying alert kept me alive over there, and now... now I can't turn it off. If I'm not ready, something might take me out. Or worse - take out someone I care about.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three main threads:

1. Finding peace from the combat dreams so you and Amanda can sleep without you shouting
2. Teaching your body it's safe to stand down - you're home, not in hostile territory
3. Being present with your family instead of scanning for threats that aren't there

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. That... that sounds right. I just... I need to be able to shut this off without losing who I am. I can't be some... I don't know... some soft guy who can't protect his family. But I can't keep going like this either.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep where Amanda and I can rest together without combat dreams
2. I teach my body to stand down when I'm home, keeping vigilance for real threats only
3. I embrace being present with my family without scanning for danger

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust anything - especially that second one about standing down while still feeling like you can protect?


**paul_persona_3**: The second one... I don't like "teach my body to stand down." Feels like surrender. What about... "I learn to read the room right - know when to be ready, know when I'm home safe"? Something like that. I need to keep my edge, just... use it when it matters.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I learn to read the room right - know when to be ready, know when I'm home safe"

That keeps your edge while learning when to use it. Smart soldier thinking.

How do the other two land? The sleep one and being present with family?


**paul_persona_3**: The sleep one... that's good. I need that. Amanda needs that. 

The family one... "embrace being present" sounds too... therapy-ish. What about just "I show up for my family - really show up, not just physically there"?


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I welcome peaceful sleep where Amanda and I can rest together without combat dreams"

✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I show up for my family - really show up, not just physically there"

You've got three solid intentions:
1. Peaceful sleep with Amanda
2. Read the room - know when you're home safe
3. Really show up for your family

How do you want to keep these close? Some options:
- Keep them in your wallet where you keep your dog tags
- Read them during morning coffee before the day starts
- Keep them in your truck where you see them driving to work

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**paul_persona_3**: Wallet. I've carried the same one since basic - it's got my dog tags, my granddad's Saint Christopher medal... these need to be there too. When I'm reaching for my license or whatever, I'll feel them.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I welcome peaceful sleep where Amanda and I can rest together without combat dreams
- I learn to read the room right - know when to be ready, know when I'm home safe  
- I show up for my family - really show up, not just physically there

Your ritual: Keep them in your wallet with your dog tags and Saint Christopher medal. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**paul_persona_3**: Yeah. Three weeks. [takes a deep breath] I just... I hope this works. For Amanda. For the kids. I can't keep letting them down like this.


**intentions_workflow_3**: [takes a deep breath]

The work starts now. Trust what you've built here.


**paul_persona_3**: I will. Thanks for... for helping me figure this out. I need to get back to the office.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Go handle your business. These intentions will travel with you.


**paul_persona_3**: Right. See you around.


**intentions_workflow_3**: See you around.
