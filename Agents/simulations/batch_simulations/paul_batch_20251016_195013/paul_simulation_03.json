  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look I dont know about all this intentions stuff. Amanda says I need to do this to stop waking her up at night. Thats it.",
  "system1": "You need to stop waking Amanda up at night.\n\nThree threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Find peace in your body and mind \n3. Create safety for both of you at home\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Just want to sleep without the nightmares. Thats all.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I release what haunts me\n3. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user2": "I guess number one sounds right. The other two feel like... I dont know. Too much feelings stuff. Just want the nightmares to stop.",
  "system3": "Got it. Let's make them more direct:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. The nightmares stop\n3. Amanda gets her rest\n\nHow about these?",
  "user3": "Yeah. Those work. Especially number one and three.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. The nightmares stop\n3. Amanda gets her rest\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. Thanks.",
  "system5": "You're welcome. Solid compass.",
  "user5": "Yeah. We'll see if it actually works.",
  "system6": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "idk man. still feels like california bullshit to me. but i guess im here so...",
  "system7": "You're here. That's enough.",
  "user7": "yeah. guess im doing this.",
  "system8": "You are.",
  "user8": "alright then.",
  "system9": "Good.",
  "user9": "so what now",
  "system10": "You wait. You show up when it\u2019s time. The intentions do their part.",
  "user10": "thats it? just... wait?",
  "system11": "That's it. The work's already in motion.",
  "user11": "feels like doing nothing.",
  "system12": "Feels like nothing until the medicine starts teaching. Then you\u2019ll see the difference between waiting and doing nothing.",
  "user12": "yeah well. im not good at sitting still.",
  "system13": "Then don't sit. Walk, stretch, clean the kitchen - just keep your hands busy and your mind loose.",
  "user13": "i can do that.",
  "system14": "Good.",
  "user14": "what if i forget what i wanted to ask when im there",
  "system15": "The medicine remembers. You'll get what you need, even if it's not what you planned.",
  "user15": "dont even know what i need. just want the nightmares to stop.",
  "system16": "Then let's build from there.\n\nThree threads:\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Find peace in my own mind\n3. Heal what keeps bringing the darkness\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "yeah. those three.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I claim peace in my own mind\n3. I heal what brings the darkness\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user17": "theyre fine. still feels like words on a page.",
  "system18": "Words on a page become real when you carry them in. The medicine will make them matter.",
  "user18": "yeah. guess we'll see.",
  "system19": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I claim peace in my own mind  \n3. I heal what brings the darkness\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now.
