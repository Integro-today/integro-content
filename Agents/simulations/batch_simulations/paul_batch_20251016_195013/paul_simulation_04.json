  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look I dont know what Im supposed to say here. Amanda wants me to do this so maybe I stop waking her up at night. Thats it.",
  "system1": "You wake Amanda up at night. She needs rest. You need rest.\n\nWhat happens when you wake her up - nightmares, restlessness, something else?",
  "user1": "Yeah. Nightmares. Wake up shouting sometimes. Dreams about the cockpit. Alarms going off. Amanda says Im drenched in sweat. Shes been sleeping in the guest room some nights.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Feel safe in your own bed again  \n3. Bring Amanda back to share your space\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "Sounds about right. Just want to sleep through the night and not scare my wife. Thats all.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety in my own bed\n3. I bring Amanda back to share our space\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "First one. The sleep thing. Thats the main thing. Dont need fancy words just want to sleep without the dreams.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked: I sleep peacefully through the night\n\nHow do the other two land?\n\n2. I reclaim safety in my own bed\n3. I bring Amanda back to share our space",
  "user4": "Second ones alright. Third one sounds weird. Just want her to sleep next to me again. Not some... whatever you said.",
  "system5": "Got it. How about: \"I sleep beside Amanda again\"",
  "user5": "Yeah that works. Just want her back in our bed.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety in my own bed  \n3. I sleep beside Amanda again\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Alright. Thanks.",
  "system7": "You're welcome.",
  "user7": "yeah",
  "system8": "Solid compass. You're ready.",

  "user10": "alright",
  "system11": "*nod*",
  "user11": "yeah",
  "system12": "Trust what comes.",
  "user12": "idk man. thats easy to say. hard when youve seen what happens when you trust the wrong thing.",
  "system13": "That's real. Trust isn't blind - it's choosing to move forward with what you've got now, not what went wrong before.\n\nThe intentions you set will serve you. Let them be enough for this journey.",
  "user13": "i guess. just want it to work. for amanda. for the kids.",
  "system14": "That's what matters - Amanda and the kids.\n\nWhat specifically needs to change so you can show up for them the way you want to?",
  "user14": "stop waking up screaming. stop jumping every time a door slams. stop... just stop being this version of me theyre scared of.",
  "system15": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Feel safe in my own body when loud sounds happen  \n3. Show my family the calm version of me they remember\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user15": "yeah. those three. thats it.",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I stay grounded when sounds startle me\n3. I show my family the steady presence they know\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user16": "number three. thats what matters. everything else is just... details.",
  "system17": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I show my family the steady presence they know\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user17": "two feels... possible. one feels like asking for a miracle. but ill take em.",
