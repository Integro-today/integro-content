  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look I dont know about all this intention stuff. Amanda says I need to figure out what I want out of this. \n\nI just want to stop waking her up at night. Want to be able to sit through dinner without snapping at the kids. Want to feel like I can handle things again. Thats it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Sit through dinner with the kids without snapping\n3. Feel capable of handling life again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah those are the things. I just want to be able to sleep without shouting and scare everyone. Want to be present with my family without this constant edge. Feel like myself again - whoever that was.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I show up calm and present with my family\n3. I reclaim the steady version of myself\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one. I need to sleep through the night without waking up shouting. Thats what started all this mess. \n\nThe other two sound good but... I dont know. That first one feels like the foundation.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night without waking up shouting\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "Second ones alright. Being calm with the family - thats what Amanda wants. \n\nThird one... I dont know about reclaiming anything. Sounds like some commercial. Maybe just \"I feel steady again\" or something. I just want to feel like I can handle things without losing it.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show up calm and present with my family\n\nHow about: I feel steady enough to handle what comes\n\nOr do you want something different?",
  "user4": "Yeah that works. Steady enough to handle what comes. Thats all I want really.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up shouting\n2. I show up calm and present with my family\n3. I feel steady enough to handle what comes\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Alright. Thanks for helping with this. Still dont know if this plant stuff will work but... at least I know what Im aiming for.",
  "system6": "Good to have a clear target. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions.",
  "user6": "Thats good to know. I probably wont remember much during the ceremony anyway. Just dont want to lose control completely.",
  "system7": "Losing control is part of the process. Your intentions will still be working underneath.",
  "user7": "yeah thats what Im worried about. Losing control. Not used to that. At all.",
  "system8": "The medicine doesn't take your control - it shows you where you're already gripping too tight. Your intentions will anchor you when it feels like too much.",
  "user8": "I guess thats what scares me. Seeing where Im gripping too tight. Been holding on so long I wouldnt know how to let go.",
  "system9": "You don't need to know how. The medicine will show you one finger at a time.",
  "user9": "One finger at a time. Okay. I can maybe handle that. Better than thinking about all of it at once.",
  "system10": "Exactly. Just one finger.",
  "user10": "Alright. One finger.",
  "system11": "You're ready.",
  "user11": "I dont feel ready. But I guess ready enough to get on the plane. Thats something.",
  "system12": "Getting on the plane counts.",
  "user12": "Yeah. Getting on the plane. I can do that.",
  "system13": "You can.",
  "user13": "Alright.",
  "system14": "Solid.",
  "user14": "Solid.",

  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I stay present and calm with my kids\n3. I trust I can handle what comes\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user17": "Yeah. Those work.",
