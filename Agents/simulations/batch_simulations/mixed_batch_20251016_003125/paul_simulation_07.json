  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know about all this intention stuff. Heroic Hearts says it helps, so here I am. I just need to stop waking up screaming. Amanda can't keep living like this, jumping out of bed when I start shouting. Three weeks till Costa Rica and I'm supposed to figure out what I want from some plant medicine? \n\nI guess... I need to understand what's happening to me at night. And I need to stop being so damn angry all the time. Don't want to lose my family. That's about it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Understand what's happening during the night terrors\n2. Release the constant anger that takes over\n3. Keep Amanda and your family close\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that's... that's about right. \n\nI just... I don't want to come back from Costa Rica and still be the guy who scares his wife at 2 AM. Or the dad who snaps at his kids for asking simple questions. \n\nHow do we turn this into whatever these intentions are supposed to be? I mean, I can write \"stop being angry\" on a piece of paper, but that hasn't worked for the past ten years.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I understand what drives my night terrors and welcome peaceful sleep\n2. I release the anger that controls my responses\n3. I show up calm and present with my family\n\nThese need to feel real, not like empty affirmations. Which lands strongest?",
  "user2": "The second one. I release the anger that controls my responses.\n\nThat's the one that gets me in trouble with Amanda. The kids too. It's like... I'm watching myself be an asshole and I can't stop it. Like someone else is driving.\n\nBut how do I release something that's been part of me since Afghanistan? It's kept me alive. It's kept my unit alive. You don't just... let that go.",
  "system3": "You're right - you don't just let that go. That anger served you. Protected you. Kept people alive.\n\nIntentions aren't about pretending the survival instincts disappear. They're about choosing what drives now.\n\n\"I release the anger that controls my responses\" stays.\n\nHow about: \"I trust my training without letting anger drive\" - captures both the skill and the shift?\n\nKeep the second intention locked. How do the other two land?",
  "user3": "Yeah... \"I trust my training without letting anger drive.\" That feels more honest. Like I'm not throwing away everything I learned, just... using it different.\n\nThe first one about understanding the night terrors - I don't know. \"I understand what drives my night terrors and welcome peaceful sleep\" sounds too... soft. Like I'm supposed to hug my demons or something.\n\nBut the third one about showing up calm with my family... that one hits. Because that's what I want. To not have Lily flinch when I raise my voice about homework. To not see Amanda brace herself when I walk in the room after a rough day.\n\nCan we fix the first one? Make it less... whatever this is?",
  "system4": "Instead of understanding your demons, what about reclaiming your nights?\n\n\"I reclaim peaceful sleep from whatever haunts me at night\"\n\nStill captures understanding what's happening, but with the action and strength you're used to.\n\nThat work for intention #1?",
  "user4": "Yeah. Yeah, that works. \"I reclaim peaceful sleep from whatever haunts me at night.\"\n\nThat's more like it. Like I'm taking back territory. I've done that before.\n\nSo we got:\n1. I reclaim peaceful sleep from whatever haunts me at night\n2. I trust my training without letting anger drive  \n3. I show up calm and present with my family\n\nThese feel... possible. Like something I could actually do, not just wish for.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I reclaim peaceful sleep from whatever haunts me at night\n2. I trust my training without letting anger drive\n3. I show up calm and present with my family\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Alright. I'll write these down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you walking through this with me. Three weeks till Costa Rica. Let's see what happens.",
  "system6": "Solid plan. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them close keeps you pointed toward what matters.\n\nThree weeks. You're ready.",
  "user6": "Three weeks. \n\nGuess we'll find out if this plant stuff is worth all the hype. But at least I know what I'm fighting for now.",
  "system7": "Exactly. You know what you're fighting for.\n\nThe intentions are locked. The rest is between you and the medicine.",
  "user7": "Between me and the medicine. \n\nAlright then. Let's do this.",
  "system8": "Let's do this.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Let's.",

  "user15": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... whatever's going on. I just need to sleep without waking up the whole damn house. Amanda says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up shouting\n2. Stop scaring Amanda \n3. Find peace from whatever's disrupting your sleep\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "I don't have PTSD. I just... I need to be able to shut it off when I'm home. Can't lose her. Can't keep doing this to my kids.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I leave the fight at the door and come home safe\n3. I protect my family from what I carry\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "The second one. \"Leave the fight at the door\" - that's what I need. When I walk into my house, I need to be the man they think I am. Not the one who brings the war home with him.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I leave the fight at the door and come home safe\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user18": "The sleep one... yeah, that's important. But \"protect my family from what I carry\" - that's too soft. Makes me sound like I'm broken or something. I'm not broken. I just need to figure out how to be who I was before.",
  "system19": "How about: \"I reclaim the man I was before\" for intention 3?",
  "user19": "No. That man's gone. I need to be someone new - someone who can live with what happened and still be worth having around."
