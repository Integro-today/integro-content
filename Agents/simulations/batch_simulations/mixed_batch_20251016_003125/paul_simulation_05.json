  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this intention stuff might help with... whatever's going on with me. So here I am.\n\nLook, I just need to sleep through the night without waking up shouting. Amanda says I scare her sometimes when that happens. I hate that. Can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Stop scaring Amanda\n3. Find healing from whatever's causing this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the things. I just... I don't know how to say them right. This whole thing feels backwards - talking about problems instead of fixing them.\n\nBut I guess... if I'm doing this plant medicine thing anyway... might as well figure out what I'm actually asking it for.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I heal what drives these reactions\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one. \n\nI need to create safety for Amanda. And myself, I guess, but mainly her. She's been dealing with... with whatever this is... for too long. I see it in her eyes when I wake up shouting. Like she's walking on eggshells in her own house.\n\nHow do I say that without sounding like some kind of victim? I'm not broken. I just need to... I don't know. Be better.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make our home feel safe again\n3. I heal what drives these reactions\n\nBetter?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that's better. \"Make our home feel safe again.\" That's exactly it. That's what I want.\n\nI want Amanda to feel safe in her own house. Want the kids to not hear me shouting in the middle of the night. Want to walk through my own front door without feeling like I'm bringing... whatever this is... inside with me.\n\nOur home used to be the one place I felt... I don't know. Like myself. Before all this.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make our home feel safe again\n3. I heal what drives these reactions\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you helping me figure out how to say what I need.",
  "system5": "Solid work. The medicine will meet you where you're at.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Roger that. I'll... I'll see what happens when I get there.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll find out if this plant stuff actually does anything, or if I've just been fooling myself thinking there's a way through this.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is good time. Let these intentions settle in - read them each morning, carry them through your day.\n\nThe medicine works whether you believe in it or not. Just show up honest.",
  "user6": "Honest I can do. Been honest my whole life - just not... not about this stuff. Not about what's really going on when the lights go out.\n\nBut I'll read 'em. Every morning at 4:30 when I'm up anyway. Might as well start practicing being honest with myself before I have to be honest with some plant in Costa Rica.",
  "system7": "4:30's a good time. Quiet. Honest.\n\nThe plant's not asking for perfection - just truth. You already know how to give that.",
  "user7": "Yeah... 4:30's when the world's real. When it's just me and the running trail and whatever's been chasing me through my dreams.\n\nTruth. I can do truth. Done it my whole life, just... different kind of truth than this. But I hear you.",
  "system8": "Different kind, same muscle.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user8": "Same muscle. Yeah... that makes sense. Been using that muscle my whole life, just in a different direction.\n\nAlright then. I'll see you on the other side of this thing.",
  "system9": "You will. Trust your training.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user9": "Roger that. Trust the training. Trust the process.\n\nSee you when I get back.",
  "system10": "Back's in 3 weeks. \n\nGo carry your truth to Costa Rica.",
  "user10": "Three weeks. Truth in my pocket, Amanda\u2019s voice in my head, kids\u2019 faces on my heart.\n\nCosta Rica, here I come.",
  "system11": "All the compass you need.\n\nGo get it.",
  "user11": "Roger that. Compass set.",
  "system12": "Boom. You're set.",
  "user12": "Set. Let\u2019s fly.",
  "system13": "Fly safe.",
  "user13": "Always do.",
  "system14": "Then go.",
  "user14": "Wheels up.",
  "system15": "Wheels up. See you on the other side.",
  "user15": "Copy that. Other side it is.",
  "system16": "Other side it is.",
  "user16": "Roger.",
