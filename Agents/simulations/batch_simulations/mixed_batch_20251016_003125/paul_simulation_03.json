Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep better, stop waking up Amanda with my... episodes. So here I am. I can't keep going like this, but I'm not broken or anything. I just need to figure out how to turn it off when I'm home.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without episodes\n2. Stop waking Amanda up \n3. Learn to turn off the alertness at home\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are about right. I just want to be able to sleep without... without the dreams. Without scaring Amanda half to death when I wake up. She says I grab her arm sometimes, or I shout things. I don't remember doing it, but seeing the look on her face the next morning... it's killing me.\n\nI need to figure out how to leave the war in the past where it belongs. Be present with my family instead of always being on edge, checking exits, scanning rooftops. My kids deserve better than this. Amanda deserves better.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I leave the war where it belongs - in the past\n3. I show up present and safe with Amanda and my kids\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I leave the war where it belongs - in the past.\" That one hits different. \n\nBut I... I don't know. Saying it like that feels too simple. Like I'm supposed to just flip a switch and forget everything? That's not how it works. Some of those guys didn't make it back. How do I just... leave them there?\n\nMaybe it needs to be stronger. More direct. I protected my unit, completed every mission. I need to protect my family now - from this. From me.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I protect my family from the war, not bring it home to them\"\n\nThe other two land okay?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that works better. \"I protect my family from the war, not bring it home to them.\" That's what I'm doing when I wake up screaming - I'm bringing it home to them. To Amanda. She didn't sign up for that.\n\nThe other two... they're fine. I mean, I need to sleep. Need to stop waking her up. But this one - this one feels like it means something. Like I'm doing my job again, protecting the people who matter.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I protect my family from the war, not bring it home to them\n3. I show up present and safe with Amanda and my kids\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I appreciate you helping me get this straight.",
  "system5": "Solid compass. Trust them.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Roger that. Three weeks until Costa Rica. I'll have these with me.",
  "system6": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them close keeps you pointed toward what matters.\n\nThree weeks. You're set.",
  "user6": "I hope you're right about that. About the medicine working even when... I'm not much for believing in things I can't see. But I've tried everything else. Everything I can control, at least.\n\nThree weeks. Then we'll see what this plant can do.",
  "system7": "You've done what you can control. Now the plant does what you can't.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "That's the hard part. Letting go of control. Been running my whole life on being the one who handles things.\n\nBut yeah. Time to see what happens when I stop trying to manage everything. Time to trust something bigger than me.",
  "system8": "That's the work. You already know how.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user8": "Copy that. See you when I get back.",

  "user18": "*nods once, slow*\n\nI can't keep waking up like this. Amanda... she's starting to look at me different. Like she's scared of what she'll find in the bed next to her. I need to figure out how to shut it off\u2014the dreams, the shouting. Don't want lose her.",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without the dreams\n2. Make Amanda feel safe again\n3. Find healing from what's causing this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "*nods*\n\nFirst one... I need to face whatever's behind these nightmares. Not calling it PTSD, but something's there. Keep seeing the same faces, hearing the same calls. Need to look at it straight on.\n\nSecond... Amanda deserves better than this version of me. She's been carrying this weight too long. I want to learn how to show up without the edge, without the walls."
