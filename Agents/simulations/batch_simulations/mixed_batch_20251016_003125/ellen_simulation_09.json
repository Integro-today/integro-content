  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I need to figure out what I'm actually doing with all this success. I've built companies, sold them, made money... but it feels like I followed someone else's playbook. Now I'm sitting on all these boards, investing in startups, and wondering if any of it actually matters.\n\nThe medicine keeps showing me glimpses of something deeper\u2014my grandmother's faith, these visions of ancestral women\u2014but then I come home and I'm right back in the same patterns. Checking emails during dinner with the kids, saying yes to every meeting, chasing the next thing.\n\nI want to know what my real contribution is supposed to be. Not just another profitable venture. Something that actually leaves the world better.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Following someone else's playbook instead of your own path\n2. Missing moments with your kids while chasing the next thing  \n3. Finding your real contribution beyond profit\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are the right threads. I keep thinking about how my kids are 9 and 12 already\u2014like when did that happen? I'm physically there at the park but mentally drafting emails in my head.\n\nAnd this business stuff... I know how to build and scale, I know how to make money. But there's this voice\u2014maybe it's my grandmother's\u2014that keeps asking \"but is this your work to do?\"\n\nI want to trust my own compass for once instead of looking around to see what everyone else is doing. The medicine keeps showing me these visions of women weaving things together, connecting ancient wisdom with modern life. Maybe that's pointing somewhere, I don't know.\n\nI guess I'm scared I'll wake up in ten years and have missed what actually mattered while I was busy being successful.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present with my kids before they grow up\n2. I trust my own compass instead of following others' playbooks\n3. I build what I'm meant to build, not just what I know how to build\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest\u2014about being present with my kids. That's the one that makes my chest tight when I think about it. But \"show up fully present\" feels... I don't know, too soft maybe? Like something you'd see on a motivational poster.\n\nWhat about something like \"I stop missing their childhood while I'm busy building someone else's dream\"? Too harsh?\n\nActually, the third one's gnawing at me too. \"Build what I'm meant to build\"\u2014that's the question keeping me up at night. I've been following maps other people drew, and I'm good at that. But what if I'm meant to build something completely different? Something that doesn't even look like success in the way I've been defining it?\n\nI need to trust that I'll know what to build when the time comes. That I don't need to force it or figure it all out right now.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I don't miss my kids' childhood for anything\n2. I trust what I know to build when it's time\n3. I follow my own compass, not someone else's map\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "These feel... cleaner. More like something I can actually hold onto when I'm in that space.\n\nThe first one\u2014I don't miss my kids' childhood for anything\u2014that's the gut punch I need. Because I am missing it, aren't I? Little moments every day.\n\nThe second one gives me some breathing room. \"When it's time\"\u2014yeah, that's important. I don't have to force the next thing. I can trust that I'll know.\n\nAnd the compass one... I'm tired of looking sideways at what everyone else is doing. My grandmother never followed anyone's map, she just knew what mattered and built her life around it.\n\nI think these might work.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I don't miss my kids' childhood for anything\n2. I trust what I know to build when it's time  \n3. I follow my own compass, not someone else's map\n\nKeep them on your phone lock screen.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll put them in my Notes app where I keep everything important. Maybe I'll set them as reminders that pop up during the day\u2014when I'm most likely to forget.\n\nThank you... I think I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "I hope so. Because I have this fear that I'll go in there and it'll just show me more of what I already know\u2014that I'm scattered and missing what matters. But maybe that's exactly what I need to see clearly.\n\nI'll try to trust it.",
  "system6": "What you already know is exactly what needs seeing clearly.\n\nTrust the showing.",
  "user6": "Yeah... maybe I've been running from seeing it too clearly. Keeping busy so I don't have to sit with it.\n\nAlright. I'll trust whatever shows itself, even if it's uncomfortable. Especially if it's uncomfortable.",
  "system7": "That's the work.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "I am. Let's do this.",
  "system8": "Solid compass. Go.",
  "user8": "Thank you. For real.",
  "system9": "You got this.",
  "user9": "I do. Finally feels like it.",
  "system10": "Good. Trust that feeling.",
  "user10": "I will. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve trusted myself this much.",
  "system11": "Hold onto that trust. It's yours.",
  "user11": "I\u2019m trying. It slips sometimes, but I\u2019m learning to grab it faster.",
  "system12": "That\u2019s the muscle. Keep using it.",
  "user12": "I\u2019m in. Let\u2019s build it.",
  "system13": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user13": "I want to stop measuring my worth by what I produce. I want to know what\u2019s mine to do next that actually matters. And I want to feel connected to my kids and David without my mind drifting to the next board meeting or deal.",
  "system14": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop measuring my worth by what I produce\n2. Know what's mine to do next that actually matters  \n3. Feel connected to my kids and David without my mind drifting\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user14": "I\u2019m ready. Let\u2019s shape them.",
  "system15": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I know my worth beyond what I produce\n2. I discover what's truly mine to do next\n3. I show up fully present with my kids and David\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user15": "The first one hits hardest. I\u2019ve been earning gold stars since kindergarten\u2014grades, exits, boards. I need to feel my value when I\u2019m just sitting on the couch, not solving anything.",
  "system16": "Got it. Keep that first one locked:\n\n\u2713 I know my worth beyond what I produce\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user16": "They\u2019re close. \u201cDiscover\u201d feels a little passive\u2014like I\u2019m waiting for a lightning bolt. And \u201cshow up fully present\u201d sounds good, but I still catch myself checking email under the table. Maybe something stronger?",
  "system17": "Stronger versions:\n\n2. I claim what's truly mine to do next\n3. I give my kids and David my full attention\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user17": "Claim\u2014yes. That\u2019s the word I use in term sheets and cap tables; I can feel it in my bones. And \u201cfull attention\u201d is concrete: phone down, eyes up, listening for real.",
  "system18": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I know my worth beyond what I produce\n2. I claim what's truly mine to do next  \n3. I give my kids and David my full attention\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user18": "I\u2019ll write them on the back of my grandmother\u2019s photo\u2014she never cared about my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, only if I called. I\u2019ll look at them at 5:30 tomorrow before the caffeine and the noise start.",
  "system19": "Perfect. She'll keep you honest.\n\n5:30, photo back, intentions first. Then let the day come.",
  "user19": "Then let the day come."
