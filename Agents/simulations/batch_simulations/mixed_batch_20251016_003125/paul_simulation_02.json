  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know about all this compass stuff. I'm here because Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help me sleep without the nightmares. And... well, Amanda's been talking about needing space if I don't get my shit together. So I guess I'm here for her too.\n\nI don't need to explore anything deep. Just want to stop waking up shouting in the middle of the night. That's it.",
  "system1": "Two threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Create safety for Amanda\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that's... that's about right. I hate that she jumps when I wake up like that. Says she never knows what might set me off. Twenty years together and now she's walking on eggshells in her own house.\n\nSleeping through the night would be something. And if I could just... I don't know, not be so damn on edge all the time. Maybe then she wouldn't look at me like she's waiting for me to explode.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda\n3. I release the edge that keeps me on alert\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I... I don't know about that third one. That edge you're talking about - that alertness - it's kept me alive. You don't just turn that off. Maybe I need to... I don't know... carry it different? Not get rid of it entirely?\n\nThe sleep thing, yeah. That one I want. And Amanda feeling safe around me... God, I hate that she doesn't anymore. But I'm not sure about just releasing something that's been protecting me my whole life.",
  "system3": "Fair point. How about:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda\n3. I carry my vigilance with wisdom, not fear\n\nBetter?",
  "user3": "Yeah... that's better. Wisdom, not fear. I can work with that.\n\nI been carrying this stuff like I'm still over there, like something might jump out at any second. But maybe... maybe I can learn when to stand down. When it's just Amanda bringing me coffee, not... not something else.\n\nThese three feel right. I can remember these.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda\n3. I carry my vigilance with wisdom, not fear\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you walking through this with me. Three weeks isn't that long.",
  "system5": "Three weeks is plenty. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're just your compass when you need direction.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Good. 'Cause I can't mess this up. Too much riding on it.\n\nI'll see this through.",
  "system6": "You will. Trust what comes.",
  "user6": "Copy that.",

  "user17": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with the nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up screaming every night\u2014Amanda's getting to the end of her rope with me.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Stop waking up screaming \n3. Keep Amanda from leaving\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "I guess... I want to sleep without whatever's chasing me in my dreams catching up. Want to stop scaring the hell out of my wife when I wake up. Want to be the man she married, not this... whatever I've become.",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I wake gently without frightening Amanda\n3. I reclaim the man I used to be\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The third one\u2014that's the one. But... I don't know about \"reclaim.\" Makes it sound like I lost something, and I hate that feeling. Maybe something more like... \"I show up as the man my family needs me to be.\" That better?"
