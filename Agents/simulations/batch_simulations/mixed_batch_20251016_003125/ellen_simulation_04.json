  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "ellen_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done these ceremonies before\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA\u2014but I keep having these profound experiences and then... I go back to checking emails at 11pm, you know? \n\nI want to understand why I can't hold onto that sense of connection. My grandmother had this deep faith, this way of being in the world that was so... grounded. And I keep chasing that feeling but I'm starting to wonder if I'm looking in the wrong places entirely.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Holding onto connection after ceremonies instead of losing it\n2. Finding the grounded faith your grandmother had\n3. Discovering where to look for what actually matters\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the threads. It's like I get these beautiful glimpses of what life could be, what *I* could be, and then it just slips through my fingers the moment I step back into my regular life.\n\nMy grandmother\u2014Bubbe\u2014she used to light candles every Friday and it wasn't just ritual, you know? She carried something with her always. I want that. Not the candles necessarily, but that... whatever that anchor is.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I carry ceremony connection into my daily life\n2. I reclaim the grounded presence Bubbe embodied\n3. I discover what actually anchors me beyond the glimpses\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one... \"I reclaim the grounded presence Bubbe embodied.\" That one hits something real. But maybe... I don't know. \"Reclaim\" feels too soft, like I'm asking for it back politely. \n\nWhat about something stronger? Like \"I embody the grounded presence Bubbe carried\" or... I want it to feel like I'm not asking permission anymore. Like I'm done waiting for someone to hand it to me.",
  "system3": "\"I embody the grounded presence Bubbe carried\" - that lands solid.\n\nHow do the other two feel? Want to strengthen those as well?",
  "user3": "Yeah, let's make them all feel like... mine. Not like I'm hoping they'll happen, but like I'm claiming them.\n\nFor the first one\u2014instead of \"I carry ceremony connection into my daily life\"\u2014what about \"I integrate sacred connection throughout every day\"? Less fragile, more... deliberate?\n\nAnd the third... instead of discovering what anchors me, maybe \"I anchor myself in what truly matters beyond the glimpses\"? Like it's active, not passive.\n\nI want all three to feel like I'm done being someone who *waits* for transformation and ready to be someone who *lives* it.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I integrate sacred connection throughout every day\n2. I embody the grounded presence Bubbe carried  \n3. I anchor myself in what truly matters beyond the glimpses\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down\u2014maybe keep them in my wallet, like you said. Been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system5": "Perfect place for them. \n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but having them close keeps you pointed toward what matters. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "I hope so. I really do.",
  "system6": "You set solid intentions. The rest unfolds.",
  "user6": "Yeah... okay. I'll try to remember that.",
  "system7": "Good. Let it be simple now.",
  "user7": "Okay. Simple. I can do that.",
  "system8": "That\u2019s it. You're ready.",
  "user8": "I guess I am.",
  "system9": "You are. Go forward.",
  "user9": "*\u2713 All 3 locked in:*\n\n*1. I integrate sacred connection throughout every day*  \n*2. I embody the grounded presence Bubbe carried*  \n*3. I anchor myself in what truly matters beyond the glimpses*\n\n*Keep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.*\n\n*These are your compass. Trust what comes.*\n\n*You're set.*",
  "system10": "Those are strong intentions. Keep them close, let them work.",
  "user10": "Thanks. I will.",
  "system11": "Good.",
  "user11": "Yeah.",
  "system12": "Solid compass.",
  "user12": "Hope it points me somewhere real this time.",
  "system13": "It will. Trust the direction, not the destination.",
  "user13": "I\u2019m trying. Just tired of chasing mirages.",
  "system14": "Then stop chasing. Let these intentions anchor you to what's already here.",
  "user14": "Here feels... quiet. Not sure I know how to stay in it.",
  "system15": "You don't need to know how. Just return to intention #2 - Bubbe's presence lives in you. That's your anchor when the quiet feels too big.",
  "user15": "I... I want to believe that. Sometimes I feel her in the kitchen\u2014her hands guiding mine when I make the soup. But then the kids yell or my phone buzzes and she\u2019s gone.",
  "system16": "She\u2019s not gone. You just looked away. Keep the soup recipe, the locket, the morning blessings\u2014whatever brings her back when you lose the thread.",
  "user16": "The locket\u2019s in my nightstand. I stopped wearing it because I thought I\u2019d outgrown needing... things.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll put it on tomorrow morning when I light the candles.",
  "system17": "Good. Let that be your first act of reclaiming what matters.",
  "user17": "First act. Okay.",
  "system18": "And the second act is letting the locket stay on when the noise starts.",
  "user18": "Even when I\u2019m pitching to investors or sitting in those board meetings with all that polished certainty?",
  "system19": "Especially then. Let them see a man who carries his grandmother's wisdom while he builds the future.",
  "user19": "I\u2019m\u2026 not a man. But yes."
