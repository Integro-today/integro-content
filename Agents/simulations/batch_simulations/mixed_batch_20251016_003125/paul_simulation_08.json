Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca might help with... whatever's going on with me. Here I am.\n\nI wake up screaming most nights. Amanda says I scare her. I hate that more than anything. Can't lose her\u2014won't lose her. If this plant stuff can stop that, I'll try it.\n\nI need to figure out how to shut it off without becoming... I don't know. One of those guys who can't stop talking about their feelings. I did my job over there. I don't regret it. But I can't keep bringing it home.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. Stop bringing the war home to Amanda\n3. Keep your edge without drowning in feelings talk\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That's... yeah.\n\nI need to sleep through the night without waking up screaming. That's first. Amanda deserves peaceful nights, not me shouting at ghosts.\n\nAnd I need to leave the war where it belongs\u2014in the past. Not in our bedroom, not in our kitchen, not in my kids' faces when they just want their dad.\n\nBut I still need to be me. Strong. Reliable. The guy people count on. Just... without the weight crushing everything good.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I leave the war in the past where it belongs\n3. I stay strong without the weight crushing everything good\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I leave the war in the past where it belongs.\" That hits me hard\u2014in a good way, I think.\n\nBut... I don't know. Saying it like that feels too soft. Like I'm letting go of something I shouldn't. Those guys I flew with, the ones who didn't make it back... feels like betrayal to just \"leave it in the past.\"\n\nMaybe something more like... \"I honor what happened without carrying it home every damn night.\" Does that work? Or is that just me being stubborn again?",
  "system3": "\"I honor what happened without carrying it home every damn night\" - that's strong. That's yours.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I honor what happened without carrying it home every damn night\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The sleep one... I need that. \"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" Simple. Direct. No fancy words. Just what I need.\n\nBut the third one\u2014the staying strong without the weight crushing everything\u2014that's where I get stuck. \"I stay strong without the weight crushing everything good\" feels like I'm supposed to be some kind of superhero. That's not real.\n\nHow about... \"I carry what matters and let the rest go.\" Is that too vague? I don't know. I just know I can't keep dragging all this heavy shit around and expect to have anything left for Amanda and the kids.",
  "system4": "\"I carry what matters and let the rest go\" - that's real. That's workable.\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I honor what happened without carrying it home every damn night\n3. I carry what matters and let the rest go\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks. Guess we'll see what this plant medicine can do.",
  "system5": "Three weeks. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're already doing their job.\n\nKeep that wallet close. You've got this.",
  "user5": "Thanks. I... yeah. Thanks.\n\nGuess I'll find out if this actually works, or if I'm just another sucker chasing hope. But Amanda believes it'll help, and that's enough for me to try.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system6": "That's enough. Her belief plus your willingness - that's what opens the door.\n\nSee you on the other side.",

  "user19": "Look, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with the nightmares, so here I am. I can\u2019t keep waking up like I\u2019m back in the cockpit, can\u2019t keep watching Amanda flinch when I shout in my sleep. I need this to work."
