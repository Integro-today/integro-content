  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_7",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this intention-setting might help with... whatever's going on with me. So here I am.\n\nLook, I just need to sleep through the night. That's it. Wake up without... without the dreams. Without scaring Amanda half to death when I come out of it.\n\nCan't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night peacefully\n2. Create safety for Amanda \n3. Find healing from whatever's causing this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those three. \n\nI need to... I don't know how to say this right. I need to stop waking up like I'm back there. Need to stop seeing their faces when I close my eyes. Need to stop jumping when a car backfires or when the kids drop something heavy upstairs.\n\nAmanda... she didn't sign up for this. She married the guy who left for basic, not the one who comes back from tours and can't sit through fireworks with his kids. She deserves better than what I'm giving her.\n\nAnd I need to figure out what's broken in me without... without becoming one of those guys who can't function. I still got a business to run, kids to raise. Can't fall apart.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without the dreams\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and my family\n3. I heal what keeps me trapped in the past\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That one hits different.\n\n\"I reclaim safety for Amanda and my family.\" That's what matters. Everything else is just... symptoms. If I can give them that - real safety, not just the illusion of it - then maybe I'm still the man I think I am.\n\nThe other two... they're important, but they're mine. This one's about them. About what I owe them after everything.\n\nYeah. Let's keep that one.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim safety for Amanda and my family\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... \"I sleep peacefully through the night without the dreams\" - that's what I want, but it feels too soft. Like I'm asking for something I don't deserve. \n\nThe third one though... \"I heal what keeps me trapped in the past\" - that one's got teeth to it. I'm not looking for peace or comfort. I'm looking to break whatever chain's got me hooked to shit that happened fifteen years ago. \n\nLet's go with that one.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I heal what keeps me trapped in the past\n\nHow about intention 1?",
  "user4": "The sleep one still bothers me. It's not just about sleeping. It's about... I don't know how to explain it. It's about not being surprised by my own reactions anymore. About not feeling like I'm about to jump out of my skin when someone slams a door.\n\nMaybe... \"I find steadiness in my own skin.\" Something like that. Where I'm not constantly waiting for the next thing to set me off.\n\nYeah. That feels more honest.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I find steadiness in my own skin\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and my family\n3. I heal what keeps me trapped in the past\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... yeah. Thanks.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. You're ready.",
  "user6": "Ready as I'll ever be.",
  "system7": "That's exactly ready enough.",
  "user7": "Yeah. It is.",
  "system8": "*nod*",
  "user8": "*nod*",
  "system9": "Carry them steady.",
  "user9": "I will.",
  "system10": "Good.",
  "user10": "...Three weeks.",
  "system11": "Three weeks is enough time for the intentions to settle in. Let them work quietly while you keep showing up.",
  "user11": "I don\u2019t even know how to write the damn things down without sounding like... I don\u2019t know, like one of those people who needs help.",
  "system12": "Then write them like you\u2019re talking to yourself. No extra words, no softening. Just the direction you want pointed.",
  "user12": "...I want the dreams to stop owning the night.  \nI want Amanda to stop flinching when I move too fast.  \nI want to keep my family without breaking myself to do it.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reclaim the night from the dreams  \n2. Make home safe for Amanda again  \n3. Hold my family without losing myself  \n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah... okay.  \n\nNight\u2019s mine, not theirs.  \nAmanda gets the man she married back.  \nI stay standing\u2014no cracks showing.",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I own the night\u2014dreams don\u2019t run me  \n2. I give Amanda the man she married  \n3. I stand solid\u2014no cracks  \n\nWhich feels strongest?",
  "user14": "Number two. If I blow that one, the rest don\u2019t matter.",
  "system15": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked: I give Amanda the man she married  \n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user15": "Number one feels like a fight I\u2019ve already lost too many times.  \nNumber three... I don\u2019t know how to keep the cracks from spreading without pretending they\u2019re not there.",
  "system16": "Then we adjust:\n\n1. I take the night back one hour at a time  \n2. I give Amanda the man she married  \n3. I stand real\u2014even with the cracks  \n\nLock these?",
  "user16": "Yeah. Lock 'em.",
  "system17": "Your 3 intentions:\n1. I take the night back one hour at a time  \n2. I give Amanda the man she married  \n3. I stand real\u2014even with the cracks  \n\nKeep them in your wallet.  \nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.  \nYou're set.",
  "user17": "Got it. They\u2019re in my wallet, right next to my wings.",
  "system18": "Solid. They\u2019ll fly with you.",
  "user18": "Roger that.",
  "system19": "Roger.",
  "user19": "See you on the other side."
