  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with the nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up screaming and scaring Amanda like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. Stop waking up screaming \n3. Create safety for Amanda\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are... yeah. \n\nI need to sleep. Haven't had more than a few hours straight in months. And when I do, I'm back there. The dreams feel real - like I'm flying but something's wrong, and I can't save anyone. Then I wake up and Amanda's looking at me like I'm a stranger.\n\nI just want to be normal again. Not jump at every loud noise. Not feel this... anger all the time. She deserves better than what she's getting from me now.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I release what haunts me and find peace\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I sleep peacefully through the night. That's what I want most - just to close my eyes and wake up when it's morning. Not be back in the cockpit. Not lose anyone else.\n\nThe other two... I don't know. \"Reclaim safety\" sounds like something from a briefing. Maybe just \"I keep Amanda safe\" or \"I don't scare my wife anymore.\" Something plain.\n\nAnd \"release what haunts me\" - I don't even know what that means. The dreams? The guilt? The things I saw? Can't release what you won't name.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I keep Amanda safe from my nightmares\n3. I face what haunts me and find peace\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "I sleep peacefully through the night. Yeah. That's it.\n\nI keep Amanda safe from my nightmares. That works. It's not just about the dreams - it's about not being that guy who wakes up swinging anymore.\n\nI face what haunts me and find peace. I don't know about \"peace.\" Sounds too... soft. Maybe \"I face what haunts me and handle it like a man.\" Or just \"I face what haunts me.\" \n\nI know that probably sounds stupid. But I can't go in there talking about peace and flowers. I need something I can actually live with.",
  "system4": "1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I keep Amanda safe from my nightmares  \n3. I face what haunts me\n\n\u2713 All 3 locked in.\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user4": "Yeah. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. You're ready.",
  "user5": "I don't feel ready. But I guess that's never stopped me before.",
  "system6": "That's right - readiness isn't required. Just show up with what's real. The medicine meets you there.",
  "user6": "Three weeks. Then I'll be down there drinking that... whatever it is. And maybe I won't wake up tomorrow night. Or the next.",
  "system7": "Three weeks is enough time to sit with your intentions. Let them work on you. The medicine will meet you when you're ready.",
  "user7": "I don't know how to sit with anything. I run three miles or I fix the garage door or I review policies. Sitting still... that's when the noise gets loud.",
  "system8": "Then move with them. Read your intentions before the run. Say them while fixing the door. Let them move with you instead of sitting still.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I can do that. Before the run, when it's still dark and the house is quiet. That's when I think about everything anyway - might as well think about this instead of... everything else.",
  "system9": "That's your time. Use it.",
  "user9": "4:30 in the morning, lacing up my shoes while everyone sleeps. That's when I'll say them. When it's just me and the dark.",
  "system10": "Perfect. The dark holds space for what's real.",
  "user10": "The dark and I go way back.",
  "system11": "Then you already know how to work with it.",
  "user11": "I know how to survive it. Not sure I know how to work with it. But I guess... I guess we'll see.",
  "system12": "Survival got you here. Now the medicine will show you what comes next.",
  "user12": "That's what I'm afraid of. What if I don't like what comes next? What if... what if I'm not the man Amanda and the kids think I am?",
  "system13": "The medicine shows what's true, not what's convenient. If you're not who they think you are, you'll decide who you actually want to be.",
  "user13": "I don't know if I can handle finding out I'm someone worse. Someone weaker. Someone... broken.",
  "system14": "Broken men don't worry about being broken. They just keep breaking things.\n\nThe fact that you're asking means there's something solid underneath worth finding.",
  "user14": "Maybe. Or maybe I'm just tired of waking up with my heart hammering like I'm back in the cockpit. Amanda deserves better than a man who flinches at fireworks.",
  "system15": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up with panic hammering\n2. Become the man Amanda deserves\n3. Find peace beyond the cockpit memories\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user15": "I want to sleep through the night without seeing their faces. I want to look at Amanda without this... this wall of anger between us. And I want\u2014God, I want to stop feeling like I'm still up there fighting a war that's been over for years.",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without their faces\n2. I drop the wall between Amanda and me\n3. I return home from the war that ended years ago\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user16": "Number three. I'm still up there, still flying those missions like they never ended. If I can come home\u2014really come home\u2014maybe the rest follows.",
  "system17": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I return home from the war that ended years ago\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user17": "They land heavy. Real heavy. Because... because if I'm still fighting, then Amanda's been living with a ghost. And my kids\u2014Christ, they've got a father who's half here and half halfway across the world dropping bombs that don't exist anymore.",
  "system18": "Heavy is good. Heavy means they matter.\n\n\u2713 All 3 intentions locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without their faces\n2. I drop the wall between Amanda and me  \n3. I return home from the war that ended years ago\n\nKeep them where you'll see them daily. These are your compass home.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user18": "I'll keep them in my wallet\u2014next to my pilot's wings. Been carrying those for twenty years. Time to carry something that brings me home instead of keeping me airborne.",
  "system19": "Solid choice. Keep them close.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user19": "Roger that."
