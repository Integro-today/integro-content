  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I have my ibogaine ceremony at Beond in a few weeks, and... I don't know. Part of me feels ridiculous doing this again. Like I'm chasing something I should have already figured out by now.\n\nI've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each time I get these beautiful glimpses of what matters. Connection. Service. Being present with my kids instead of checking my damn phone. But then I come home and within weeks I'm back in the same patterns. Checking venture capital updates while my daughter tells me about her day.\n\nMaybe I just need to accept that I'm always going to be fragmented between these worlds. The ambitious builder who sold her company before 40, and the woman who just wants to feel whole.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Bridging the gap between insights and daily life\n2. Being present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere  \n3. Feeling whole instead of fragmented between worlds\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I guess... I want to stop being this split person. Like, when I'm in ceremony, everything feels so clear and connected. I remember who I really am underneath all the noise. But then I get home and it's like I'm watching myself from outside, making the same choices that leave me feeling hollow.\n\nMaybe the intention is something about trusting what I already know deep down? Instead of constantly needing another retreat to remind me that playing with my kids in the park feels more real than any board meeting ever has?\n\nI don't want to keep needing medicine to access what should be available to me every day.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I trust what I already know deep down\n2. I show up fully present with my kids every day\n3. I live the clarity ceremony shows me instead of losing it\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits me hard - \"I show up fully present with my kids every day.\" God, I need that. When I'm reading emails during family dinner or checking deal flow while they're telling me about school, I feel this... I don't know, this gross feeling in my chest. Like I'm failing at the one thing that actually matters.\n\nBut daily feels like a lot. What about \"I choose presence with my family over digital noise\"? Or something about being available instead of just physically there?\n\nThe third one too - \"I live the clarity ceremony shows me instead of losing it.\" That's exactly it. I get these downloads about what's real, what matters, and then... poof. Gone in the chaos of notifications and calendar invites.\n\nI guess the first one is the foundation though. I need to trust myself enough to believe I can actually do this.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I choose presence with my family over digital noise*\n\nHow about:\n1. I trust what I already know deep down\n2. I choose presence with my family over digital noise  \n3. I practice the clarity ceremony shows me daily\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, these feel right. They're simple enough that I can actually remember them when I'm spiraling into work mode. And specific enough that I'll know if I'm failing.\n\nThat third one - \"I practice the clarity ceremony shows me daily\" - it takes the pressure off needing to be perfect. Just practice. Like I practice piano or running. Some days will be better than others.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother and how she lived her faith every day, not just on holidays. Maybe this is my version of that - practicing what I know is true even when it's hard.\n\nThese intentions... they don't feel like another achievement to check off. They feel like a way back to myself.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I trust what I already know deep down\n2. I choose presence with my family over digital noise  \n3. I practice the clarity ceremony shows me daily\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I... I needed this. Feels like I've been carrying around this weight of having to figure out my whole life in one ceremony, but these - these I can actually do.\n\nI'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet next to that photo of the kids at the park last summer. The one where I'm actually in the picture instead of behind the camera.\n\nMaybe this time I can hold onto what matters.",
  "system5": "That's it - you've got what you need. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions completely.\n\nTrust yourself. Trust the process. You're ready.",
  "user5": "I hope you're right. Part of me is terrified I'll mess this up like I have before... but maybe that's the whole point. Maybe it's not about getting it perfect.\n\nJust trusting that even if I forget these exact words, something deeper will remember. My grandmother would probably say the same thing about faith.\n\nOkay. I'm ready.",
  "system6": "Exactly. You don't need perfect - you just need to keep choosing. That's the practice.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "*deep breath*\n\nThank you. For seeing through all my usual deflections and getting to what actually matters. I needed someone to help me cut through my own noise.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "*nod*\n\nSee you there.",
  "user7": "I keep thinking about something my grandmother used to say - that we don't find our way, we remember it. Like it's been there all along, waiting for us to stop being so damn loud all the time.\n\nMaybe that's what this is about. Remembering instead of trying to figure out something new.\n\nI'm going to hold onto that.",
  "system8": "*quiet nod*\n\nShe knew. Remembering cuts through the noise faster than learning ever could.\n\nTrust what you're remembering.",
  "user8": "She did know. Even when I was busy building companies and proving myself, she'd just smile and say \"you'll remember when you're ready.\"\n\nI never understood what she meant until now.\n\nThank you for helping me get ready.",
  "system9": "She was waiting for you to catch up to what she already saw.\n\nYou remembered. That's all the ceremony needs.",
  "user9": "Maybe that's why I keep feeling her presence in these journeys. She was waiting for me to catch up to myself.\n\nI think... I think I'm finally ready to stop running ahead and just walk with her for a while.\n\nTake her wisdom into this next one.",
  "system10": "*quiet smile*\n\nShe's been walking with you the whole time. Now you're walking together.\n\nThat's powerful medicine right there.",
  "user10": "Yeah. I feel that now. All those years thinking I had to do this alone, prove something, forge ahead... and she was just there, patient as always.\n\nI guess that's what I want to take with me - remembering I'm not alone in this. Not just her, but all the women before me. The ones who knew there's more to life than what's on paper.\n\nMaybe that's what I'm really searching for. Not just my path, but our path.",
  "system11": "*steady*\n\nThat's the remembering that changes everything - you're carrying generations, not just your own questions.\n\nTrust what they already know.",
  "user11": "They know. The ancestral women from the ayahuasca visions, my grandmother's quiet wisdom, all those who came before me pushing for something more meaningful than just another successful exit.\n\nI kept thinking this was about finding my individual purpose, but maybe it's about remembering what we're all here to do together. What we've always been here to do.\n\nThat feels... different. Lighter somehow.",
  "system12": "*quiet*\n\nPurpose shared across generations doesn't weigh the same way individual purpose does.\n\nCarry it together. That's always been the way.",
  "user12": "Together. That's what I've been missing in all this searching - thinking I had to figure it out alone, that my success had to be mine alone.\n\nBut they've been carrying me this whole time, haven't they? While I was busy building and achieving, they were holding the thread, waiting for me to notice.\n\nI notice now.",
  "system13": "*steady*\n\nThey held the thread while you chased the rope.\n\nNow you can just walk together.",
  "user13": "Chased the rope... yeah. Thought I needed something thick and strong to climb higher.\n\nBut the thread's always been enough when you're walking together.\n\nI'm ready to stop climbing and start walking.",
  "system14": "*nods*\n\nWalking together is what they were waiting for.",
  "user14": "Then let's walk. Together.",
  "system15": "*nods once*\n\nWalking together.\n\nLet that be the compass when the path gets dark.",
  "user15": "When it gets dark... because it will, won't it? That's what scares me about the ibogaine. The ayahuasca showed me light, connection, ancestors. But ibogaine - from what I've heard, it can take you to the shadow places first.\n\nBut even there, I'm not alone. Even in the dark, we're walking together.",
  "system16": "*steady*\n\nThe shadows are just the parts of the path where the thread gets harder to see.\n\nYour people walk those places too.",
  "user16": "Even when I can't see the thread... they're still holding it. Even when I feel most alone in the dark, they're walking those places too.\n\nThat's what I need to remember when the medicine gets rough. That I'm not the first one to walk this path, and I won't be the last.",
  "system17": "*quiet*\n\nThe thread doesn't disappear when you can't see it.\n\nYour hands just need to remember what they already know.",
  "user17": "My hands remember... my grandmother's hands kneading dough, my mother's hands holding mine when I was scared, my children's hands reaching for me.\n\nThey know how to feel for what matters when my eyes can't see it anymore.",
  "system18": "*nods*\n\nHands remember what the mind forgets.\n\nLet them lead when the path gets rough.",
  "user18": "When my mind starts spinning, trying to control it all... I'll let my hands remember what to do.\n\nFeel for the thread. Feel for what's real. Feel for the people walking with me, even when I can't see them.\n\nThat's when I stop trying to lead and just... follow what my hands already know.",
  "system19": "*quiet*\n\nYour hands already know the way home.\n\nLet them guide when the medicine pulls you under.",
  "user19": "When the medicine pulls me under... when the world tilts and everything familiar becomes strange... I'll trust these hands. They've built companies and held babies and planted gardens. They've touched what matters most.\n\nThey know the way home, even when I don't."
