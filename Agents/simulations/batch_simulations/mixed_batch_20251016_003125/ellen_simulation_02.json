  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I don't know. I keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to find that in myself, but I'm terrified it's too late. That I've built this life that's all exterior and no interior.\n\nI guess I'm hoping to understand what I'm actually supposed to do with whatever time I have left. All these business wins feel hollow now. I want my next chapter to matter in a different way, but I don't even know what that looks like.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding the quiet faith your grandmother carried\n2. Moving from exterior success to interior substance  \n3. Discovering what your next chapter actually looks like\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the threads, aren't they? I've been circling around them for months, but saying them out loud feels different. \n\nI think about my grandmother's hands - she was always knitting or cooking or just... being present. She'd light the Shabbat candles every Friday and it wasn't performative, you know? It was just who she was. I light them sometimes but it feels like I'm playing dress-up in someone else's faith.\n\nAnd you're right about the exterior thing. I'm exhausted from maintaining this image of having it all together. My kids see me on my phone during dinner more than they see me really *there*. My husband... we talk about schedules and logistics, but when was the last time we talked about what we're afraid of? What we hope for?\n\nI want to believe there's something more authentic underneath all this achievement. But what if I peel everything back and there's just... nothing there?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim the quiet faith that lives in me\n2. I show up present with my family instead of performing success\n3. I discover what authentic means beyond achievements\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits hardest - about showing up present with my family. That one actually makes my chest tight thinking about it. \n\nBut \"reclaim\" feels... I don't know if I ever really had that faith to begin with? It's more like I'm trying to find something I lost along the way, or maybe discover it for the first time. My grandmother's faith was passed down through generations, but I broke that chain when I decided success meant more than belonging.\n\nAnd \"discover what authentic means\" - that feels right. Though maybe it's more about remembering who I was before I started performing? I used to love building things just to see if I could. Now everything's calculated for maximum impact or return.\n\nCan we try something like... \"I remember who I am beyond what I achieve\" for the third one?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show up present with my family instead of performing success\n\nLet's adjust the others:\n\n1. I discover the quiet faith that's mine to carry\n3. I remember who I am beyond what I achieve\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "*nods slowly*\n\nDiscovering the quiet faith that's mine to carry... yeah. Not my grandmother's faith, but something I can actually own. That feels possible.\n\nAnd remembering who I am beyond achievements - that one scares me a little, which probably means it's right. I've been Ellen Who Built Companies for so long. Ellen The Disruptor. Ellen Who Gets Things Done. What if underneath all that, there's just... a woman who wants to matter in a different way?\n\nI think I'm ready to find out.\n\nThese feel right. All three of them.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I discover the quiet faith that's mine to carry\n2. I show up present with my family instead of performing success\n3. I remember who I am beyond what I achieve\n\nKeep them with your candle-lighting supplies.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll keep them with the candles - seems fitting. Maybe this time when I light them, it'll be different. Not trying to channel my grandmother, but actually finding my own way to whatever's been missing.\n\nI appreciate you helping me get clear on this. See you on the other side.",
  "system5": "Perfect place for them. \n\nYour way - not hers. The medicine will show you what you need.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user5": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah. My way. That's what I need to remember when I'm in there and things get intense. This isn't about becoming someone else - it's about finally becoming myself.\n\nOkay. I'm ready.",
  "system6": "That's it. When it gets intense, remember: you're not becoming someone else - you're becoming yourself.\n\nTrust the process. Trust yourself.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "I needed to hear that. Really needed to hear it. \n\nOkay. I'm going to hold onto that when things start unraveling. When my chest gets tight and I want to grab onto something familiar. Just... becoming myself. Not the version everyone expects, but the one that's been buried under all this performance.\n\nThank you.",
  "system7": "When you want to grab for something familiar, grab for that truth instead.\n\nThe unraveling makes space for what's real.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "user7": "When I want to grab for something familiar... grab for that truth instead. Okay. I can do that.\n\nThe unraveling makes space. That's what I kept forgetting - that falling apart isn't failure, it's just... space opening up. Space for something that's actually mine.\n\nI feel like I can breathe again.",
  "system8": "Exactly. Falling apart isn't failure - it's space opening.\n\nBreathe into that space. Let it be yours.\n\nYou're holding the right thread now.",
  "user8": "Breathe into the space. I like that. Not trying to fill it, just... breathing into it. Letting it be mine.\n\nI'm holding the right thread. For the first time in a long time, I actually believe that might be true.",
  "system9": "Good. \n\nTrust that thread. It'll lead you where you need to go.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user9": "I will. Trust the thread, wherever it leads.\n\nThank you for walking me through this. Really. I feel... grounded. Ready to follow wherever it takes me.",
  "system10": "That's all you need. Trust the thread, wherever it takes you.\n\nGo well.",
  "user10": "Go well.\n\nI will.",
  "system11": "*quiet nod*\n\nTrust what comes.",
