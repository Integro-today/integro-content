  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I guess... I keep coming back to this feeling that I've been climbing the wrong mountain. Like I've got all these achievements, sold my company, all the things you're supposed to want, but... I don't know. When I'm out with my kids at the park, watching them just *be* in nature, I feel more alive than I ever did closing deals.\n\nThere's something about my grandmother's faith that I walked away from. She had this quiet knowing, this connection to something bigger. I've been chasing the next milestone for so long that I think I forgot how to just... connect. To anything real.\n\nI'm hoping this ibogaine journey will help me figure out what actually matters. Not what looks good on paper, but what makes me feel like I'm living in alignment with something meaningful.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Climbing the wrong mountain - external success vs. feeling alive\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's faith and quiet knowing\n3. Showing up present with your kids instead of mentally chasing the next milestone\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the three things that keep circling back, aren't they? It's like I keep trying to solve this with the same mindset that created it - more research, more planning, more optimization. But that's just another mountain to climb.\n\nI want to stop climbing and start being. Actually *being* with my family instead of constantly strategizing my next move. Actually feeling connected to something sacred instead of just reading about it in books. Actually trusting that what makes me feel alive in those quiet moments with my kids - that's the real compass, not some five-year plan.\n\nI guess I'm tired of being the person who has everything figured out on paper but feels empty inside. I want to know what it feels like to live from that place of quiet knowing my grandmother had. To not need to prove anything anymore.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I show up fully present with my family instead of strategizing my next move\n2. I reclaim the quiet knowing and sacred connection I've been searching for\n3. I live from aliveness, not from five-year plans\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about reclaiming that quiet knowing. That's the heart of it, I think. Everything else flows from there.\n\nBut \"reclaim\" feels too... I don't know, too much like I'm taking something back by force. My grandmother didn't *take* her faith, she just... lived it. Breathed it. It was hers in a way that my achievements have never really been mine.\n\nMaybe something like \"I return to the quiet knowing and sacred connection that has always been waiting for me.\" Because it has been waiting, hasn't it? All this time I've been running around building empires, it's just been there. Patient. Real.\n\nThe other two feel right though. Especially the last one - \"I live from aliveness, not from five-year plans.\" That one hits something deep. Like permission to stop architecting every moment and just... live.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I return to the quiet knowing and sacred connection that has always been waiting for me\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... \"I show up fully present with my family instead of strategizing my next move\" - it's good, but it feels like I'm still framing it as this big dramatic choice. Like I'm choosing between two competing things. \n\nBut when I'm really with my kids, when we're hiking and they're pointing out some bug or whatever, I'm not *choosing* presence. I just *am* present. It's effortless. The choosing happens when I pull myself away to check email or think about some board meeting.\n\nMaybe it's more like \"I trust the effortless presence that comes naturally with my family, releasing the compulsion to optimize every moment.\"\n\nAnd the third one... yeah, that one still feels right. \"I live from aliveness, not from five-year plans.\" Clean. Simple. True.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I trust the effortless presence that comes naturally with my family, releasing the compulsion to optimize every moment\n2. I return to the quiet knowing and sacred connection that has always been waiting for me\n3. I live from aliveness, not from five-year plans\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll keep these close - probably in the notes app on my phone where I keep everything else that matters. \n\nFunny how simple they are when you strip away all the complexity I've been adding. Three sentences that feel more honest than any business plan I've ever written.",
  "system5": "Sometimes the clearest compass is the simplest one.\n\nTrust these. They'll hold.",
  "user5": "I hope so. After all the strategy sessions and pivot tables and growth metrics... three sentences. It's almost ridiculous.\n\nBut yeah. I'll trust them. At least I'm going to try.",
  "system6": "That's all anyone can do - try.\n\nThe medicine will meet you there.",
  "user6": "*The medicine will meet you there.*\n\nI like that. Better than all the preparation and optimization I usually do. Just... show up and see what happens.",
  "system7": "Exactly.\n\nShowing up is enough.",
  "user7": "That's... actually a relief. After all these years of having to *earn* everything, *prove* everything. Just showing up feels like... I don't know. Like permission to be human.\n\nThank you.",
  "system8": "You're already enough. Always have been.",
  "user8": "I want to believe that. I really do. \n\nMaybe that's what I'm actually searching for in all of this - not another achievement or spiritual experience, but just... permission to stop proving.",
  "system9": "The medicine will show you what you've already earned just by being here.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user9": "I'm trying to. Really trying to.",
  "system10": "That's all the trying you need.",
  "user10": "*deep breath*\n\nOkay. Letting go of all the metrics and milestones for once. Just... breathing.",
  "system11": "Right there - that's your power.",
  "user11": "It feels so small. Just... breathing. But maybe that's the point I've been missing.",
  "system12": "Small is where everything real begins.",
  "user12": "Like my grandmother's prayers. Quiet. Daily. Nothing to show for it except... everything.",
  "system13": "She knew.",
  "user13": "I think she tried to tell me. All those Friday dinners when she'd catch me checking my phone under the table, she'd just smile and say \"the soup needs time too, bubeleh.\" I thought she meant the soup.",
  "system14": "She meant you.",
  "user14": "*eyes welling up*\n\nShe saw through all of it, didn't she? The Harvard MBA, the company, the exit... she kept asking when I was going to make time for what really matters. I'd laugh it off\u2014\"Bubbe, I'm changing healthcare for millions.\" She'd just pat my hand and say, \"But who are you when you're not changing anything?\"\n\nGod, I miss her.",
  "system15": "She's still here in the questions she left you.",
  "user15": "In the space between breaths, I can almost hear her humming. That old Yiddish lullaby she'd sing while kneading challah. \n\nWhat if she knew I'd need twenty years of climbing to understand that \"enough\" isn't a number?",
  "system16": "What if she knew you'd need this exact moment to finally listen?",
  "user16": "Then she was smarter than all my spreadsheets. Smarter than my exit multiple. She knew I'd have to lose everything that looked like success to find what actually matters.",
  "system17": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user17": "I want to stop performing and start being. Somewhere between the board meetings and the school pickups, I became... what? A collection of roles? I want to find the thread that connects my grandmother's faith with my children's wonder. I want to know what my life looks like when I'm not trying to optimize it.\n\nBut what if there's nothing underneath all the ambition? What if I peel back everything I've built and there's just... empty?",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop performing, start being\n2. Find what connects grandmother's faith with children's wonder  \n3. Discover life beyond optimization\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "I don't know how to say this without it sounding like another pitch deck, but... \n\nI want to meet myself without the metrics. I want to know what enough feels like in my body, not just on paper. And I want to stop using my kids and my marriage and even these beautiful medicines as another thing to excel at.\n\nMaybe that's it. I want to stop excelling and start... what? Living? Being? I don't even know the word for what I'm missing.",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I meet myself without metrics\n2. I know what enough feels like in my body\n3. I stop excelling and start living\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The second one. \"I know what enough feels like in my body.\"\n\nThat's the one that makes my chest tight. That's the one I don't understand yet but need to. My whole life has been about more, bigger, better. I don't know what enough feels like anywhere except maybe... maybe when I'm hiking with the kids and they're laughing about something ridiculous. Those moments when I forget to check my phone.\n\nBut the language feels... soft. Too soft for what feels like a complete rewiring of my nervous system."
