  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I have an ibogaine retreat coming up in Cancun this winter. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... but this feels different. Like maybe this is the one that finally helps me hold onto what I've been searching for.\n\nI keep having these glimpses\u2014during meditation, sometimes just walking in nature with my kids\u2014where I remember who I really am. But then I lose it. Back to the boards, the investments, the endless emails. I'm tired of this cycle.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Hold onto who I really am between ceremonies\n2. Stop losing myself to the boards and investments  \n3. Be present with my kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, that captures it. Especially the part about being mentally elsewhere when I'm with my kids\u2014my daughter's nine and she's already starting to notice when I'm checking out during conversations.\n\nI guess... I want to stop performing all these roles and actually live something real. But I don't know how to say that as an intention without making it sound like another achievement to check off.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I embody who I really am beyond the ceremonies\n2. I stay present when my kids need me\n3. I live something real instead of performing roles\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one hits hardest. \"I stay present when my kids need me.\" That's the one that keeps me up at night\u2014how many moments I've already missed.\n\nBut the first one... \"I embody who I really am beyond the ceremonies.\" That's what I'm really after, isn't it? To stop being this fragmented person who shows up differently depending on the room.\n\nCan we keep the second one but make the first one feel less... I don't know, less like I'm trying to optimize my spiritual life like I optimized my company?",
  "system3": "How about:\n\n1. I carry my real self into daily life after the ceremonies\n2. I stay present when my kids need me\n3. I live something real instead of performing roles\n\nThe first one feel more grounded?",
  "user3": "Yes. \"I carry my real self into daily life after the ceremonies\"\u2014that feels like something I can actually do, not just another metric to hit.\n\nAnd the second one still cuts right through me. My son's twelve now, and I can see him pulling away, trying to figure out if I'm really here or just going through the motions.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I carry my real self into daily life after the ceremonies\n2. I stay present when my kids need me\n3. I live something real instead of performing roles\n\nKeep them wherever you'll see them daily\u2014wallet, desk, morning routine.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I'll write them down\u2014maybe keep them in my wallet next to that photo of my grandmother. She always knew who she was, no matter where she was.",
  "system5": "Solid choice. That photo's been waiting for this.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I appreciate this. Really. It's strange\u2014I've built companies, closed million-dollar deals, but sitting here with three simple sentences feels like the most important thing I've done in years.",
  "system6": "Sometimes the smallest compass points the truest north.\n\nTrust where these take you.",
  "user6": "I will. Maybe this time I can stop running and actually follow it.",
  "system7": "The running's done. Time to walk forward.",
  "user7": "Yeah... walk forward. I can do that.",
  "system8": "Good. One step at a time works.",
  "user8": "One step at a time.",
  "system9": "Exactly. You've got this.",
  "user9": "I hope so. This time feels different\u2014like maybe I\u2019m finally ready to stop proving and just be.",
  "system10": "That's the difference between building a life and living one.",
  "user10": "God, that hits. I've been so busy constructing the perfect resume of a life I forgot to actually live it.",
  "system11": "The constructing's over. Time to inhabit what you built.",
  "user11": "Inhabit it... I don't even know what that looks like. I've been performing \"Ellen the successful entrepreneur\" for so long\u2014when I try to just... be in my own house, my own family, my own skin, it feels like I'm wearing someone else's clothes.",
  "system12": "Start with what feels like yours. Not the role, not the performance - what actually belongs to you.",
  "user12": "My grandmother's candlesticks. They're in a box in the garage\u2014I've moved them three times and never unpacked them. When I was little she'd light them Friday nights and hum this tune... I don't even know if I remember it right anymore.",
  "system13": "The candlesticks are yours. The humming will come back when you light them.",
  "user13": "Maybe this weekend. I'll... I'll dig them out. Though David will probably think I'm finally losing it\u2014he keeps asking why I need all this \"spiritual stuff\" when we already have everything.",
  "system14": "David doesn't need to understand the candlesticks. This is between you and what you've been missing.",
  "user14": "You're right. He's been patient with all the retreats, the meditation apps I never use, the books gathering dust... but this feels different. More real. Like I'm not trying to add something new\u2014just reclaiming what I already had.",
  "system15": "Exactly. Not adding - remembering.",
  "user15": "Remembering... God, I can almost hear her voice when I think about it. She'd say the light remembers who we are, even when we forget.",
  "system16": "She knew what she was talking about.",
  "user16": "Yeah... she really did.",
  "system17": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reclaim your grandmother's candlesticks and what they represent\n2. Stop performing \"Ellen the entrepreneur\" and inhabit your actual life\n3. Trust the remembering - the light knows who you are\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user17": "I want to... no, I *will* light those candles again. Not just once, but every Friday. Even if David thinks it's weird. Even if the kids complain.\n\nAnd when I catch myself slipping into that old pitch mode\u2014talking about exits and valuations and board seats\u2014I'll stop. Take a breath. Ask myself \"who am I trying to impress right now?\"\n\nThe remembering part... that's harder to put into words. Maybe it's just trusting that I already have what I'm searching for. That I don't need to earn it or prove it or optimize it.",
  "system18": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I light my grandmother's candles every Friday\n2. I pause when I slide into pitch mode and choose real presence instead\n3. I trust what I already have without needing to earn it\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user18": "They land... heavy. In a good way. Like I'm finally saying what I actually mean instead of what sounds impressive.\n\nThe Friday candles feel doable. Like a thread I can follow back to her. The pitch mode thing\u2014God, that's going to be hard. I catch myself mid-sentence sometimes, already performing. But maybe that's the point. To notice it happening and just... stop.\n\nAnd trusting what I already have? That one scares me most. Because if I already have enough, then what's all this striving been for?",
  "system19": "That's the medicine working - asking the real questions now instead of the impressive ones.",
  "user19": "Yeah... maybe that's what I've been running from. If I stop proving, stop achieving, what's left? Just me. And what if that's not enough?"
