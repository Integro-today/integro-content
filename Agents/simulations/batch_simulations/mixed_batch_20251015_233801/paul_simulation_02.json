  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with... everything. My wife Amanda, she says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that. Can't keep going like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking Amanda up with shouting\n2. Feel safe in your own bed at night\n3. Make Amanda feel safe again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those three things. That's... that's it exactly. I just want to sleep through the night without waking her up. Want her to feel safe again.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me\n3. I reclaim safety in our bed\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "I don't know... \"reclaim safety\" sounds like something's wrong with me. Nothing's wrong, I just need to sleep better. \n\nHow about \"I find rest at night without disturbing Amanda\"?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I find rest at night without disturbing Amanda\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "That's better. The other two... I guess they work. The second one's good - Amanda deserves to feel safe. First one feels too soft, but I get what you're saying.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me  \n3. I find rest at night without disturbing Amanda\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system5": "Good. Your wallet's carried you through a lot - now it'll carry what matters most.\n\nTrust the process. You're ready.",
  "user5": "Yeah. We'll see. Never thought I'd be doing something like this, but here we are. Thanks for... helping me get this straight.",
  "system6": "You got it. The medicine works with what's real - and you just showed up with exactly that.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user6": "See you there.",
