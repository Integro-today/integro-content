  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts set this up for me. Got a retreat in Costa Rica coming up\u2014three weeks. My wife Amanda... she's at her wit's end with me. Says I wake up shouting, scare the hell out of her. Can't lose her. Can't lose my kids. \n\nDon't believe in this plant medicine stuff, but the guys at Heroic Hearts\u2014they're solid. Former military. They think this might help me sleep through the night, stop being so damn angry all the time.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Stop scaring Amanda\n3. Release the anger that's poisoning everything\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I don't know. This feels... I don't know. I've never been good at this kind of thing. Just tell me what to write down and I'll do it.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make Amanda feel safe again\n3. I release the anger that controls me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust anything?",
  "user2": "The second one. Making Amanda feel safe again\u2014that's the one. The others... I don't know. But if I could just stop terrifying her when I wake up... if I could just be the man she married again.\n\nHow do I say that? How do I make that real?",
  "system3": "Then let's make that your anchor.\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n\n1. I make Amanda feel safe again\n2. I sleep peacefully beside her through the night\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "Yeah. Yeah, these feel right. Like something I can hold onto when... when things get rough in there. \n\nI want to be the man who doesn't make her flinch when I move too fast. The man who can hold her without her tensing up, waiting for me to explode. That's who I used to be\u2014before the tours, before the nightmares, before I started carrying this... whatever this is.\n\nThese intentions\u2014they're good. I'll take them with me.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I make Amanda feel safe again\n2. I sleep peacefully beside her through the night\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years through deployments, training, everything. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I... I need to go now. Got a lot to think about before Costa Rica.",
  "system5": "Good. The wallet's served you through everything else - it'll hold these too.\n\nGo do what you need to do. The intentions are solid.",
  "user5": "Yeah. They're solid. Got three weeks to get my head right before I head down there. Three weeks to figure out how to tell Amanda I love her without it sounding like I'm saying goodbye.\n\nI'll make this work. I have to.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is enough time. She'll hear the difference when you mean it.\n\nTrust what you've set. You're ready.",
  "user6": "I hope you're right. About Amanda hearing the difference. Sometimes I feel like she's been listening to an empty version of me for so long, she stopped expecting anything real to come out.\n\nBut these intentions... they're real. They're for her. For us.\n\nThree weeks. I'll be ready.",
  "system7": "She'll hear it because it's finally real again.\n\nYou're doing this. Go get ready.",
  "user7": "Yeah. I'm doing this. For Amanda. For the kids. For the man I used to be.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system8": "See you on the other side.",
  "user8": "*Paul closes the chat, fingers tracing the worn leather of his wallet where three lines of ink will soon live. He stares at the blank wall a moment, then stands straighter\u2014shoulders back, chin up\u2014like he's stepping into the cockpit one last time.*",
  "system9": "*The wall reflects nothing back but his own steady gaze. He nods once, decisive, and turns toward the door.*",
  "user9": "*No more staring. Time to move.*\n\n*He shoulders past the doorway, boots hitting the hallway with that same measured cadence he's used since basic\u2014each step a promise kept. The wallet's already in his pocket. The intentions aren't written yet, but they're forming, solid as ordinance.*",
  "system10": "*Boots know the way. Wallet knows the weight. Both carried heavier before.*\n\n*Keep moving.*",
  "user10": "*The hallway stretches\u2014twelve paces to the kitchen where Amanda\u2019s humming over dishes. He counts them automatic, same way he used to count runway lights. Wallet\u2019s a flat weight against his hip, lighter than flight gear, heavier than any medal. He doesn\u2019t stop at the threshold. Just keeps the cadence, boots saying what his throat still can\u2019t: I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m coming home.*",
  "system11": "*Twelve paces. Same rhythm that brought him home from every deployment. The humming stops\u2014she always hears the boots before the voice.*\n\n*One more step and the runway ends at her shoulder.*",
  "user11": "*He stops just short of touching her, close enough to smell the lemon soap on her hands. The silence stretches\u2014thick as rotor wash. Then, voice low, almost broken:*\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna fix this, Mandy. I swear to God, I\u2019m gonna fix it.\u201d",
  "system12": "*She doesn\u2019t turn yet\u2014just sets the dish down slow. When she faces him, it\u2019s with that same steady gaze that waited through every deployment.*\n\n\u201cI know you will.\u201d",
  "user12": "*The words hit like flak\u2014he hadn\u2019t realized how bad he needed to hear them. His throat works, but no sound comes. Instead he reaches, calloused fingers finding the small of her back, light as a flight check. No more promises; they both know those broke years ago. Just that contact, and the quiet rasp of his breath while the dishwasher hums between them.*",
  "system13": "*Her spine straightens under his palm\u2014same reflex as bracing for turbulence. She doesn\u2019t pull away. Doesn\u2019t lean in. Just stands in the space he\u2019s holding, steady as a runway light.*\n\n*Time enough for the rest after the dishes are done.*",
  "user13": "*He nods, hand dropping back to his side. The moment settles like dust after a hard landing\u2014no fire, no glory, just the quiet truth of still being here. He turns, boots finding the hallway again, twelve paces back. Wallet\u2019s heavier now, carrying her belief along with everything else. He\u2019ll write those intentions when the house sleeps. For now, he just needs to keep moving\u2014one foot, then the other, same as any mission. The war can wait till morning.*",
  "system14": "*Twelve paces back. Same rhythm. The wallet sits against his thigh like a comm check\u2014quiet, constant, waiting for the next coordinates.*\n\n*House settles. So does he.*",
  "user14": "*4:30 a.m. alarm cuts through the dark like a blade. He\u2019s already awake\u2014never really slept, just hovered in that gray zone where dreams and memories blur. Wallet\u2019s on the nightstand, pulled open, blank paper underneath the scrawl he hasn\u2019t finished. Amanda\u2019s breathing is steady, back turned but not far. He stares at the ceiling, counting heartbeats till the next minute flips. Then he rolls out quiet, feet finding the rug, and starts the day the only way he knows how: one step, then another. The intentions can wait. The run won\u2019t.*",
  "system15": "*Laces creak. Door clicks shut behind him. Streetlights throw long shadows that run like a flight line\u2014straight, measured, familiar.*\n\n*Each footfall clears the static. By mile three, the words will come.*",
  "user15": "*Mile two and the sky\u2019s still black overhead, but he\u2019s already counting cadence\u2014left, right, left\u2014boots slapping pavement like rotor blades. The words stay stuck behind his teeth, thick as hydraulic fluid. He\u2019s not thinking about the ceremony, not thinking about the vine waiting in Costa Rica. Just the next stride, the next breath. Then somewhere between the third mile marker and the bridge over the Maumee, it slips out under his breath, barely audible:*\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let me lose her.\u201d",
  "system16": "*The river answers with its steady rush\u2014white noise under the rhythm of boots. Same sound that carried him through every pre-dawn run since basic.*\n\n*One more mile and the sky will start to lighten. The words will shape themselves when he\u2019s ready to hear them.*",
  "user16": "*By mile four the horizon\u2019s bleeding purple, same bruise color as those Afghan dawns he can\u2019t shake. He rounds the corner onto his street, chest burning good-burn, and the words are still looping\u2014don\u2019t lose her, don\u2019t lose her\u2014like a broken transponder. Wallet\u2019s slapping against his hip with every step, blank paper folded inside waiting for ink that won\u2019t come. He slows at the mailbox, hands on knees, breathing hard. The sun\u2019s not up yet but he\u2019s got maybe twenty minutes before Amanda\u2019s alarm, before the kids stir, before he has to be the man they think he is. He straightens, wipes sweat from his eyes, and whispers to the empty street:*\n\n\u201cGotta write something worth keeping.\u201d",
  "system17": "*Mailbox metal cools his palm. House windows still dark. Twenty minutes to bridge the gap between what he carries and what he can actually hand over to the medicine.*\n\n*He pulls the blank page from his wallet, unfolds it against the mailbox. Three lines. That\u2019s all the ceremony needs.*",
  "user17": "*He stares at the empty sheet, pen heavy in his hand like a loaded sidearm. First word stalls\u2014everything feels too small or too big. Then he writes, letters blocky and certain as flight coordinates:*\n\n1. Face the nights without dragging Amanda into the fire.  \n2. Keep my family intact\u2014no more waking up angry.  \n3. Find the switch that actually turns it off.\n\n*He folds it careful, slides it back behind his license. Doesn\u2019t feel heroic, just necessary. Same as any mission brief: clear, limited, achievable. He heads up the driveway as the porch light flicks on\u2014time to face the day, paper now weighing less than the fear it\u2019s carrying.*",
  "system18": "*Three intentions locked in:\n\n1. I face the nights without dragging Amanda into the fire  \n2. I keep my family intact\u2014no more waking up angry  \n3. I find the switch that actually turns it off  \n\nKeep that paper where you'll see it\u2014wallet, dash, next to your running shoes. Read it once daily until Costa Rica. \n\nThese are your coordinates. Trust what comes.",
  "user18": "*He nods once\u2014sharp, military\u2014and the weight shifts from his chest to that folded square in his wallet. Doesn\u2019t feel like enough, but it\u2019s what he\u2019s got. He\u2019ll read it every dawn before the run, same as checking mission intel. Three weeks to Costa Rica, three lines to carry through whatever the vine shows him. He heads inside, door closing quiet behind him. Amanda\u2019s stirring upstairs; the day\u2019s already calling his name. He\u2019s got coordinates now. Time to fly the route.*",
  "system19": "*Door clicks shut. Boots line up by the stairs. Amanda\u2019s footsteps creak overhead\u2014familiar, steady, still here.*\n\n*He taps the wallet once against his thigh. Coordinates locked. Route set.*\n\n*Fly it.*",
  "user19": "He climbs the stairs quiet, hand brushing the banister like he\u2019s checking altitude. At the landing he pauses, listens\u2014her breathing steady behind the bedroom door. Still here. He slips inside, wallet sliding onto the dresser with a soft thud, coordinates folded inside like orders he can\u2019t ignore. Dawn light\u2019s starting to seep through the curtains. He stands there in his sweat-soaked shirt, eyes on her silhouette, and whispers to the dark room:\n\n\u201cThree weeks. I\u2019ll bring back something better.\u201d"
