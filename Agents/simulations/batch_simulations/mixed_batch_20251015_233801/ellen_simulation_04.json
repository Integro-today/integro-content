  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an ibogaine retreat at Beond in a few weeks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... but this feels different. Like maybe this is the one that'll finally help me hold onto what I've been searching for instead of losing it when I get back home.\n\nI keep having these experiences where I see what's possible - connection, meaning, being present with my kids - but then I slip back into the same patterns. Checking email during dinner, saying yes to boards I don't care about, waking up at 5:30 to meditate and then... not meditating.\n\nI guess I'm hoping ibogaine will show me how to actually live what I've been learning. How to stop collecting spiritual experiences like achievements and actually change.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop collecting spiritual experiences like achievements and actually change\n2. Show up present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere  \n3. Live what you've been learning instead of losing it when you get home\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are exactly the right threads. It's like you can see the pattern I keep falling into - chasing the next experience but not knowing how to live it.\n\nWhen I think about actually changing, not just collecting... I feel this tightness in my chest. Like if I really let myself change, who even am I without all the striving? My whole identity has been built on achievement, on being the one who figures things out, who gets things done.\n\nBut then I see my daughter's face when I'm half-listening while checking my phone, and I know she deserves better. They both do.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I embody what I learn instead of collecting experiences\n2. I show up fully present when my kids need me\n3. I discover who I am beyond achievement\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I embody what I learn instead of collecting experiences\" - that one hits me hard. It's like you're holding up a mirror to something I've been doing for years, across every part of my life. Not just spiritual stuff... I've been collecting accomplishments, connections, even insights like they're trophies.\n\nBut the language feels... I don't know. Too soft maybe? Like it needs more weight to it. This isn't just about learning to embody - this is about survival. About not wasting my life collecting experiences while missing the actual living of it.\n\nMaybe something like \"I stop chasing experiences and actually live what I know is true\"? I want it to feel like a line in the sand, you know? Not just a nice intention but a commitment to stop this pattern that's been running my whole life.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I stop chasing experiences and actually live what I know is true\n\nHow do the other two land?\n- I show up fully present when my kids need me\n- I discover who I am beyond achievement",
  "user3": "The second one about my kids... that feels right in my gut. But \"fully present\" - I'm already arguing with myself about it. Like, what does that even mean when I'm running three boards and trying to be everything to everyone? \n\nMaybe it needs to be more specific? Something like \"I put my phone away during dinner and really see my children\" - no, that's too small. But \"fully present\" feels like another thing I'll fail at.\n\nAnd the third one... \"discover who I am beyond achievement\" - that terrifies me. What if there's nothing there? What if I strip away all the success and there's just... emptiness? My grandmother had her faith, this deep well of meaning. But I walked away from all that to build companies and now I'm 45 wondering if I traded something precious for a bunch of money I don't even know what to do with.\n\nI think that's the one that scares me most. Which probably means it's the one I need.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show up fully present when my kids need me\n\nFor intention 3 - fear tells you it's the right direction. How about: I reclaim what matters beyond achievement\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I stop chasing experiences and actually live what I know is true\n2. I show up fully present when my kids need me  \n3. I reclaim what matters beyond achievement\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "I feel it in my chest - this weight of actually committing to these. Not just saying them but knowing I'll have to live them. That third one especially... \"reclaim what matters beyond achievement.\" It's like you just named the thing I've been running from for twenty years.\n\nI'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too. Maybe this time when I come back from retreat, I won't just add ibogaine to my collection of experiences. Maybe this time I'll actually come back different.\n\nThank you. I needed someone to help me name what I couldn't quite say out loud.",
  "system5": "You named it yourself. I just helped shape the words.\n\nTrust these intentions when the medicine shows you what you need to see. They'll hold.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I hope you're right. About being ready, I mean. Part of me feels like I'm standing at the edge of something huge, and another part is still that little girl at piano recitals trying to hit every note perfectly.\n\nBut these words... they're mine now. And maybe that's enough to start with.",
  "system6": "That tension - between the edge and the recital - that's exactly where the work happens. \n\nTrust the intentions. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Yeah... I feel that. The edge and the recital - that's been my whole life, hasn't it? Always trying to perform while something deeper keeps calling.\n\nI'll trust it. I have to.",
  "system7": "Good. Let that recognition settle in - seeing the pattern is the first step to changing it.\n\nYou're on your way now.",
  "user7": "It's settling alright. Like something just clicked into place that I didn't even know was out of alignment. Twenty years of building and achieving, and maybe this is the first time I really see what it's been costing me.\n\nThank you. For helping me get here, to this edge. I think I'm finally ready to step off it.",
  "system8": "Step off it then. The medicine will meet you where you are.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user8": "I will. God, I'm terrified and... something else I can't name. But I'm going.\n\nThank you. For walking me to this edge and reminding me I don't have to perform anymore. Just be.",
  "system9": "That \"something else\" - that's the medicine already working.\n\nGo meet it.",
  "user9": "It's already starting, isn't it? This feeling like I'm... waking up from something. Not the ibogaine yet, just - I don't know - like I'm already different than when we started talking.\n\nI'm going to go be with my kids now. Really be with them.",
  "system10": "Go be with them. This is what showing up looks like.\n\nThe intentions will carry forward.",
  "user10": "They will. I can feel it - like I've been carrying this heavy suit of armor and finally figured out how to unbuckle it. Maybe I don't have to take it all off at once, but now I know it's possible.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system11": "See you on the other side.",
  "user11": "I'm ready.",
  "system12": "You're ready.",
  "user12": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah. I am.",
  "system13": "Go.",
  "user13": "I'm going.",
  "system14": "Trust what comes.",
  "user14": "I will.",
  "system15": "Good.",
  "user15": "Thank you\u2014for everything.",
  "system16": "You're welcome.",
  "user16": "*exhale*\n\nHere we go.",
  "system17": "You're set.",
  "user17": "I'm ready.",
  "system18": "Go meet it.",
  "user18": "I\u2019m walking in now\u2014bare feet on cool tile, the salt-laced air already pulling yesterday\u2019s emails out of my chest. I keep hearing my grandmother\u2019s Hebrew prayer above the soft drumbeat: \u201cReturn, return.\u201d I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll find, but I\u2019m going to meet it with my eyes open this time.",
  "system19": "Eyes open is enough. Let the drum carry you.",
  "user19": "I feel it\u2014each beat loosens something I\u2019ve been gripping since the IPO roadshow. My shoulders drop; the board decks, the cap tables, all that weight sliding off like wet sand. I\u2019m not climbing anymore\u2014I\u2019m being carried."
