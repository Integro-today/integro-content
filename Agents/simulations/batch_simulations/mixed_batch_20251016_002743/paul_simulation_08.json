  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with the nightmares, so here I am. I guess... I just want to stop waking up screaming. Amanda can't keep living like this.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without screaming\n2. Give Amanda peace in her own home\n3. Find what the nightmares are trying to tell me\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those three. \n\nI just... I need to stop scaring my wife in the middle of the night. She's been dealing with this for years now, and I can see it wearing her down. The other night she told me she doesn't feel safe sleeping next to me anymore. That hit hard.\n\nI guess if I'm being honest, these dreams\u2014they're not just random. Same thing every time, different details. Always about the ones we couldn't save. Sometimes it's Saunders, sometimes it's Rodriguez. Sometimes it's just... faceless voices calling for help I couldn't give.\n\nI don't want to lose her. That's why I'm doing this thing I don't believe in.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I honor what the dreams carry without being consumed\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself. That's it. That's what I need.\n\nI want to adjust it though. Make it stronger. Something like... \"I protect my home and restore peace for my family.\" That sound right? I don't know. I need it to feel like I'm doing something, not just receiving something. \n\nI'm not some victim here. I'm a protector. That's what I've always been. I just need to figure out how to protect us from what's inside my own head.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I protect my home and restore peace for my family\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... I sleep peacefully through the night. That sounds too soft. Like I'm asking for a lullaby or something. I need it to feel more like I'm taking back control, not just hoping for mercy.\n\nMaybe something like \"I face the night without fear\" or \"I command my nights with strength.\" I don't know. I just can't have it sounding like I'm some... I can't have it sounding weak.\n\nThe third one about honoring the dreams - that one's hard. I don't want to honor anything about this mess. But I get what you're saying. They're not going away just because I hate them.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I command my nights without fear\n2. I protect my home and restore peace for my family\n3. I carry what matters from the dreams and release the rest\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user4": "Better. Much better.\n\nThe first one feels like something I can actually say without feeling like I'm surrendering. \"I command my nights without fear\" - yeah, that's what I need. Not asking for peace, taking it.\n\nThe third one's still tough but... I can work with that. Carry what matters, release the rest. Like separating the wheat from the chaff. Maybe there's something in those dreams I need to remember, something important about what happened over there. But I don't need to keep reliving every damn detail every night.\n\nThese feel like something a man could actually fight for.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I command my nights without fear\n2. I protect my home and restore peace for my family  \n3. I carry what matters from the dreams and release the rest\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Got it. I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for twenty years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I... I appreciate you helping me get this right. Not sure what's going to happen down there in Costa Rica, but at least now I know what I'm fighting for.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "Copy that. I'm ready.",
  "system7": "Good hunting.",
