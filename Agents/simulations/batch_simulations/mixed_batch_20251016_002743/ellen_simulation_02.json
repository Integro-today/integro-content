  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks and... I don't know. I've done all the right things, built the company, made the money, even sat with ayahuasca and all the others. But I'm still searching for something I can't name. \n\nMaybe it's about finding what actually matters now that the scoreboard I used to measure myself against feels meaningless. Or maybe it's about finally understanding why I can't seem to hold onto that sense of connection I feel in ceremony when I'm back in my real life with David and the kids.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what actually matters beyond the meaningless scoreboard\n2. Holding onto ceremony's connection in real life with David and the kids\n3. Understanding what you're still searching for that you can't name\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are it. Just... how do you turn that into something that actually works? I've spent my whole life setting goals and hitting targets, but this feels different. Like I'm trying to aim at something I can't see yet.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what truly matters beyond achievement\n2. I bring ceremony's connection home to David and the kids\n3. I welcome the unnamed thing I'm searching for\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user2": "The second one. That one hits me in the chest. I keep thinking about how my daughter asked me last week why I'm always \"kind of here but kind of not\" and I didn't have an answer. She's nine - she shouldn't be asking that question.\n\nI want to bring ceremony home, but I don't even know what that looks like. How do you carry something so... big... into homework help and dinner prep and the chaos of Tuesday mornings?",
  "system3": "I hear you. Kids notice everything, especially when we're only half-present.\n\nLet's adjust that second intention to something you can actually practice:\n\n1. I discover what truly matters beyond achievement\n2. I show up fully present when my family needs me\n3. I welcome the unnamed thing I'm searching for\n\nThe ceremony isn't the connection - *you* are. The medicine just reminds you what's already there between you and your people.\n\nHow do these land now?",
  "user3": "I show up fully present when my family needs me. That feels... possible. Not some huge transformation, just showing up. Being there when they need me instead of when I can squeeze them in between emails.\n\nBut what if I set this intention and then blow it again? I've promised myself I'd be more present before. David's heard it all. The kids have too. How's this time different?",
  "system4": "This time the intention isn't a promise to them - it's a compass for you.\n\n1. I discover what truly matters beyond achievement\n2. I show up fully present when my family needs me\n3. I welcome the unnamed thing I'm searching for\n\nYou'll blow it. Everyone does. The intention isn't perfection - it's direction. When you catch yourself disappearing, you come back. That's the practice.\n\nAll 3 locked in?\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Yeah. They're locked in. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she used to say the same Hebrew blessing every Friday night, no matter what chaos the week brought. Same words, same candles, same presence. Maybe this is my version of that. Coming back, over and over, even when I drift.",
  "system5": "Your 3 intentions:\n1. I discover what truly matters beyond achievement\n2. I show up fully present when my family needs me  \n3. I welcome the unnamed thing I'm searching for\n\nKeep them wherever you'll see them daily - wallet, phone, nightstand.\n\nYour grandmother knew: presence is a practice, not a destination. The medicine will show you the way back when you forget.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I'll keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nI guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.",
  "system6": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - but now you have your compass.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Okay. I will. \n\nI keep thinking about what you said - that the medicine works even when I forget. That maybe I don't have to hold so tight to everything, that I can trust the process. That's... not really how I've lived my life. But maybe it's time to try something different.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system7": "Exactly. Loosen your grip, let the medicine do its work.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user7": "*User is now default*",
  "system8": "Let's set intentions.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your journey.\n\nI'll help you build 3.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user8": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Beond says this ibogaine might help me figure out what's next, so here I am. \n\nI've been wandering through these spiritual spaces for five years now - ayahuasca showed me ancestral women calling me to weave connections, psilocybin gave me back my childhood joy in nature, MDMA helped me grieve my grandmother properly. But it's all... fragmented. Like I'm collecting beautiful pieces but can't seem to make them into anything real.\n\nI can't keep going like this - successful on paper but hollow inside, searching for something I can't even name.",
  "system9": "Three threads:\n\n1. Weave all these beautiful pieces into something real\n2. Find what's next instead of wandering\n3. Fill the hollow space with what actually matters\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user9": "Yeah... that's it exactly. I need to stop collecting experiences like achievements and actually build something that lasts. \n\nMy grandmother used to knit these intricate patterns - said the key was picking up every stitch, not dropping any. Maybe that's what I need to learn. How to not drop the stitches between who I am in ceremony and who I am at the breakfast table with my kids.",
  "system10": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I weave my spiritual insights into daily life\n2. I discover what I'm truly searching for\n3. I show up whole - the same person in ceremony and at breakfast\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user10": "The third one hits hardest. That disconnect between ceremony-Ellen and breakfast-Ellen... my kids see it most. They'll ask about my trips and I'll try to explain, but it's like I'm speaking another language.\n\nBut \"show up whole\" feels too... soft? I don't know. Maybe that's just my Type 3 talking, always needing to sound impressive.\n\nI like the first one too - \"weave insights into daily life.\" That's the piece I keep dropping. I get these profound experiences then... what? Go right back to checking emails during dinner?",
  "system11": "How about:\n\n1. I practice what the medicine teaches me every day\n2. I discover what I'm truly searching for\n3. I bring ceremony-Ellen to the breakfast table\n\nStronger language, same meaning.",
  "user11": "Yes. These feel real. Like something I can actually hold onto when the medicine gets intense and I'm not sure who I am anymore.\n\n\"I bring ceremony-Ellen to the breakfast table\" - that one makes me tear up a little. My kids deserve that version of me. The one who remembers we're all connected, who can sit in nature without needing to check her phone, who knows there's more to life than the next deal.\n\nI want to write these down. Keep them close when I'm scared or forget why I'm doing this.",
  "system12": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I practice what the medicine teaches me every day\n2. I discover what I'm truly searching for  \n3. I bring ceremony-Ellen to the breakfast table\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user12": "Yeah. I'm ready. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. For helping me find the words when I couldn't.",
  "system13": "Solid work, Ellen. The words were already in you - we just shaped them into something you can hold.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user13": "I will. When I'm sitting with that ibogaine and things start getting weird, I'll remember why I'm there. Not for another achievement or story to tell, but to finally stop dropping the stitches between who I am and who I want to be.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system14": "That's it exactly. The medicine will meet you there.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user14": "I hope so. Been running toward something my whole life, but maybe it's time to stop running and just... arrive. Finally arrive at myself.\n\nThank you for walking with me through this. Means more than you know.",
  "system15": "You just did stop running. Right here, in this moment.\n\nThe arriving has already begun.",
  "user15": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah... yeah, it has.",
  "system16": "*quiet nod*\n\nCarry that breath with you.",
  "user16": "I will. It's in my chest now, this feeling like something just clicked into place. Like when I was nine and finally understood how to read music - suddenly the notes made sense as a song instead of just symbols on a page.\n\nI'll carry it. I promise.",
  "system17": "That click is real. Trust it.",
  "user17": "I do. God, I actually do.",
  "system18": "Then you're ready.",
  "user18": "Ready as I'll ever be. Let's do this thing.",
  "system19": "Go.",
  "user19": "Going."
