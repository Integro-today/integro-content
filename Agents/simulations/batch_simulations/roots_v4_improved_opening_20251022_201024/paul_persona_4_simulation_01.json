  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\n\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Look i just want the nightmares to stop. Thats all i care about. Just tell me what to do.",
  "user1": "I hear you. Nightmares are brutal. They wear you down.\n\nThis work isn't about quick fixes though. It's about understanding what healing actually means - not curing symptoms, but integrating what they're pointing to.\n\nMaybe start with the content. See if there's anything useful in how nightmares relate to wholeness rather than just making them stop.\n\nWant to hear today's teaching first?",
  "system2": "Fine. Whats the lesson.",
  "user2": "Most people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nNightmares aren't broken parts to erase. They're often messengers from parts that got split off. Healing would mean welcoming them back in, not destroying them.\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system3": "So you\u2019re saying i should just welcome the nightmares? That\u2019s supposed to help?",
  "user3": "Not welcome the suffering. Welcome what they're carrying.\n\nNightmares usually point to something that needs integration - terror, grief, rage. Parts that got locked away because they were too much to feel at the time.\n\nHealing isn't enjoying the nightmares. It's listening to what they're trying to show you, then finding ways to carry that truth without being consumed by it.\n\nWhat do your nightmares usually contain?",
  "system4": "Its always the cockpit. The alarms. Voices on comms. Sometimes i cant pull up in time. Sometimes theres kids on the ground. Look i dont want to talk about this.",
  "user4": "Got it. That sounds horrific.\n\nYou don't have to describe the details. I hear that these aren't just dreams - they're carrying something real that happened.\n\nThe teaching here: healing isn't about making these memories disappear. It's about changing your relationship to them so they don't own your sleep anymore.\n\nBut we don't need to unpack the content. Let's just stay with this: what does healing mean to you right now, in this moment?",
  "system5": "Healing means not waking up screaming. Means Amanda sleeping in our bed again. Means my kids stop looking at me like im about to explode. I dont care about wholeness or whatever. Just want to be normal again.",
  "user5": "I hear that. You want your life back. Your family back.\n\nThat's real. That's what matters.\n\nThe \"wholeness\" piece isn't about becoming some spiritual guru. It's about getting all of yourself back - the parts that can sleep through the night, be present with Amanda, not scare your kids.\n\nEven if we call it by different names, we're talking about the same thing. You want to feel whole enough to function, to connect, to rest.\n\nWhat's one small piece of normal you're missing most?",
  "system6": "Dinner. Used to sit through dinner without getting pissed about nothing. Now everything sets me off. Forks clinking, kids talking over each other. Just want to eat with my family and not feel like i gotta escape.",
  "user6": "Dinner. That simple thing that holds a family together.\n\nNow it's a minefield. The noise, the chaos, the feeling trapped - I hear how that sets off the alarm system your body learned somewhere else.\n\nThis is the work. Not fixing you, but helping you reclaim those moments without your nervous system hijacking everything.\n\nWhat's your main takeaway from today? About healing, about getting dinner back, about what needs to happen?",
  "system7": "I guess... maybe the nightmares arent the problem. Maybe theyre just telling me something got broken that needs fixing. I still think its bs but i dont know. Maybe worth trying to listen instead of just fighting it every night.",
  "user7": "That's it. Fighting every night keeps the war alive. Listening - even just a little - might be the first step toward getting your evenings back.\n\nI'm adding this to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That's what matters.",
  "system8": "Yeah. Thanks.",
  "user8": "You're welcome.\n\nTake care.",
  "system9": "Yeah. You too.",
  "user9": "Appreciate that.\n\nTake care.",
