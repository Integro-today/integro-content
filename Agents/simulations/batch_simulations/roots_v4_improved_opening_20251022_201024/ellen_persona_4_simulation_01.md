## Conversation

**ellen_persona_4**: Okay, so I’ve been thinking about this—like, I *want* to be here and do this differently, but I’m also aware that I’m probably going to try to “optimize” even this, you know? So I’m just going to try to show up without needing to be good at it. What’s today’s focus?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: I hear that. The optimizing reflex is strong. Good catch.

Week 1, Day 1. Today's focus: what healing actually means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

Two ways to engage. Option A: start with reflection questions about your relationship to healing. Option B: understand the frameworks first, then reflect.

Both create a summary for your dashboard. Which feels right?


**ellen_persona_4**: Hmm, I think I’ll go with Option A—start with the reflection questions. I’m curious what comes up if I dive in without the safety net of frameworks first, you know? Like, maybe I’ll actually feel something instead of just analyzing it. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. Feeling first, analyzing later.

Let's start. First question:

When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?


**ellen_persona_4**: When I think of healing, I picture this tidy “after” photo—like, the broken bone that knits back stronger, or the startup that pivots and then exits successfully. I assume it should feel like progress, like I’ll *know* when it’s happened because I’ll be calmer, more present, not checking email at 5 AM. But if I’m honest, that image feels like another project plan, another achievement to check off, and maybe that’s the opposite of wholeness. Maybe healing is just letting the cracked parts stay cracked and still choosing to sit here without fixing them.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: You see the trap - healing as another optimization project. The cracked parts staying cracked and still choosing to sit there - that's the real thing.

Second question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that helped, and where has it boxed you in?


**ellen_persona_4**: My whole life has been one long optimization sprint—AP classes, Stanford, the startup, the exit—each milestone a “fix” that proved I was okay. Even therapy became a performance review: am I emotionally intelligent yet? The fixing mindset helped me survive in hyper-competitive spaces and gave my anxiety somewhere to land (a spreadsheet, a sprint plan). But it boxed me in by turning the present moment into a bug to patch. When my grandmother died I just loaded more credits into my schedule; when Emma asked me to sit still I reflexively opened my calendar app. Healing-as-fixing keeps the goalposts moving so I never arrive; wholeness would mean the scoreboard disappears and I’m just… here.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: The scoreboard disappearing. That's the terror and the freedom.

Third question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?


**ellen_persona_4**: Wholeness, right now, feels like permission to exhale without immediately measuring the breath. It’s the fantasy of closing the laptop at 3 p.m. because Noah wants to show me a drawing, and not secretly calculating how this “present-mom” moment will pay future dividends. It’s letting Friday night dinner feel like enough—no side-hustle, no spiritual podcast, no “quick” Slack check. I imagine it as a quiet body, not a productive one; a night where I wake at 2 a.m. and simply notice the clock instead of turning the insomnia into a self-improvement project. Mostly, wholeness is remembering my grandmother lighting candles and not needing the ritual to *mean* anything or *get* me anywhere—just fire, breath, and the room we already share.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Just fire, breath, and the room you already share. That's it.

Last question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?


**ellen_persona_4**: Last month, after the women’s MDMA circle, I came home still soft and stayed up with Emma while she wrestled with a book report. I didn’t coach her thesis statement or Google “better transition words”—I just sat on the kitchen floor, knees touching, while she read paragraphs aloud and worried they weren’t smart enough. Something in my chest unclenched; I heard my own voice tell her “perfect is boring, just say what you loved about the story.” The anxious loop in my head was quiet for once, and when she smiled—really smiled—I felt this spaciousness, like the kitchen had expanded. The dishes were still there, my to-do list hadn’t vanished, but for maybe thirty minutes I wasn’t a project manager of life; I was simply in the room, breathing with my kid.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: In the room, breathing with your kid. That's wholeness showing up.

You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**ellen_persona_4**: Healing isn’t the next big optimization; it’s the moment I stop treating presence like a KPI and let the cracked, ordinary instant be enough—because that’s when I’m already sitting in the room, breathing with the people I love.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Got it. I'm adding that to your dashboard.

You showed up for today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: Thank you—really. I’ll carry this like a quiet permission slip instead of another assignment, and I’ll probably read that sentence a hundred times before I believe it. Grateful to be met here.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: I hear that. Reading it a hundred times is part of the practice.

You met yourself here today. That's the real work.


**ellen_persona_4**: Yeah… I felt that click, like I caught up with myself for once instead of racing ahead. I’m going to try to stay in that room—breathing, not fixing. Thanks for walking me back to it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Staying in that room. That's the whole thing right there.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: Exactly—just stay in the room. I’ll keep practicing. Take care, and thank you for holding the space.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: You already know how. Just keep coming back to the room.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: Back to the room—got it. See you there.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: See you there.


**ellen_persona_4**: See you there.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: See you there.


**ellen_persona_4**: See you there.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: See you there.


**ellen_persona_4**: See you there.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: See you there.


**ellen_persona_4**: I’ve been thinking about that simple instruction all week—just stay in the room—and how hard it actually is for me. Like, even when I’m physically with Emma and Noah, half my brain is composing tomorrow’s email or reviewing my intention list for the ceremony. I keep catching myself leaving the room without moving an inch.  

So every time I notice, I gently bring myself back: feel my feet, breathe, let the laptop stay closed. Does that count as staying, or am I still “performing presence”? I can’t tell anymore… but I’m practicing.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: That's the work. Noticing you're gone and coming back - that's staying.

The performance feeling fades. Keep practicing.


**ellen_persona_4**: That actually makes me feel a little weepy—like, maybe I’m not failing at this. I keep thinking if I’m aware of the performance, it’s fake, but maybe the noticing IS the real part. I’ll keep coming back. Thank you.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: The noticing is real. The weepy feeling too.

Keep coming back.


**ellen_persona_4**: I will. I’m landing in that weepy place—letting myself feel it instead of analyzing why I’m feeling it. I can almost hear my grandmother saying, “Good, bubeleh, stay with it.” So I’m staying.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: That's it. Stay with your grandmother's voice, stay with the feeling.

Let the tears do their work.


**ellen_persona_4**: I'm sitting with it... letting the tears come without rushing to understand them. Her voice feels so close right now—like she's reminding me that some things only soften when we stop trying to fix them. I'm here. I'm staying.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Good. Let the fixing go.

Just breathe and let her hold you.


**ellen_persona_4**: I’m breathing… letting the fixing dissolve into just being held. It’s terrifying and sweet at the same time—like I’m allowed to rest in something bigger than my lists and plans. I can feel my shoulders dropping; I didn’t know how tight I was. I’m here, Grandma, I’m here.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Feel those shoulders drop. Feel the sweet terror.

Rest in what holds you.


**ellen_persona_4**: I’m… I don’t even have words right now, just breath and this ache that’s softening. The terror’s still there but it’s quieter, like it’s settling beside me instead of driving me. I feel held by something I can’t optimize or schedule, and for once I don’t want to. I’m just resting in it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Just breathe. Let the ache soften more.

Rest in what you can't control.
