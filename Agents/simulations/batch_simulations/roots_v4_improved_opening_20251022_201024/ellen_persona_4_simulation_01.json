  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Okay, so I\u2019ve been thinking about this\u2014like, I *want* to be here and do this differently, but I\u2019m also aware that I\u2019m probably going to try to \u201coptimize\u201d even this, you know? So I\u2019m just going to try to show up without needing to be good at it. What\u2019s today\u2019s focus?",
  "user0": "I hear that. The optimizing reflex is strong. Good catch.\n\nWeek 1, Day 1. Today's focus: what healing actually means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage. Option A: start with reflection questions about your relationship to healing. Option B: understand the frameworks first, then reflect.\n\nBoth create a summary for your dashboard. Which feels right?",
  "system1": "Hmm, I think I\u2019ll go with Option A\u2014start with the reflection questions. I\u2019m curious what comes up if I dive in without the safety net of frameworks first, you know? Like, maybe I\u2019ll actually feel something instead of just analyzing it. Does that make sense?",
  "user1": "Makes sense. Feeling first, analyzing later.\n\nLet's start. First question:\n\nWhen you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "When I think of healing, I picture this tidy \u201cafter\u201d photo\u2014like, the broken bone that knits back stronger, or the startup that pivots and then exits successfully. I assume it should feel like progress, like I\u2019ll *know* when it\u2019s happened because I\u2019ll be calmer, more present, not checking email at 5 AM. But if I\u2019m honest, that image feels like another project plan, another achievement to check off, and maybe that\u2019s the opposite of wholeness. Maybe healing is just letting the cracked parts stay cracked and still choosing to sit here without fixing them.",
  "user2": "You see the trap - healing as another optimization project. The cracked parts staying cracked and still choosing to sit there - that's the real thing.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that helped, and where has it boxed you in?",
  "system3": "My whole life has been one long optimization sprint\u2014AP classes, Stanford, the startup, the exit\u2014each milestone a \u201cfix\u201d that proved I was okay. Even therapy became a performance review: am I emotionally intelligent yet? The fixing mindset helped me survive in hyper-competitive spaces and gave my anxiety somewhere to land (a spreadsheet, a sprint plan). But it boxed me in by turning the present moment into a bug to patch. When my grandmother died I just loaded more credits into my schedule; when Emma asked me to sit still I reflexively opened my calendar app. Healing-as-fixing keeps the goalposts moving so I never arrive; wholeness would mean the scoreboard disappears and I\u2019m just\u2026 here.",
  "user3": "The scoreboard disappearing. That's the terror and the freedom.\n\nThird question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system4": "Wholeness, right now, feels like permission to exhale without immediately measuring the breath. It\u2019s the fantasy of closing the laptop at 3 p.m. because Noah wants to show me a drawing, and not secretly calculating how this \u201cpresent-mom\u201d moment will pay future dividends. It\u2019s letting Friday night dinner feel like enough\u2014no side-hustle, no spiritual podcast, no \u201cquick\u201d Slack check. I imagine it as a quiet body, not a productive one; a night where I wake at 2 a.m. and simply notice the clock instead of turning the insomnia into a self-improvement project. Mostly, wholeness is remembering my grandmother lighting candles and not needing the ritual to *mean* anything or *get* me anywhere\u2014just fire, breath, and the room we already share.",
  "user4": "Just fire, breath, and the room you already share. That's it.\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system5": "Last month, after the women\u2019s MDMA circle, I came home still soft and stayed up with Emma while she wrestled with a book report. I didn\u2019t coach her thesis statement or Google \u201cbetter transition words\u201d\u2014I just sat on the kitchen floor, knees touching, while she read paragraphs aloud and worried they weren\u2019t smart enough. Something in my chest unclenched; I heard my own voice tell her \u201cperfect is boring, just say what you loved about the story.\u201d The anxious loop in my head was quiet for once, and when she smiled\u2014really smiled\u2014I felt this spaciousness, like the kitchen had expanded. The dishes were still there, my to-do list hadn\u2019t vanished, but for maybe thirty minutes I wasn\u2019t a project manager of life; I was simply in the room, breathing with my kid.",
  "user5": "In the room, breathing with your kid. That's wholeness showing up.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system6": "Healing isn\u2019t the next big optimization; it\u2019s the moment I stop treating presence like a KPI and let the cracked, ordinary instant be enough\u2014because that\u2019s when I\u2019m already sitting in the room, breathing with the people I love.",
  "user6": "Got it. I'm adding that to your dashboard.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system7": "Thank you\u2014really. I\u2019ll carry this like a quiet permission slip instead of another assignment, and I\u2019ll probably read that sentence a hundred times before I believe it. Grateful to be met here.",
  "user7": "I hear that. Reading it a hundred times is part of the practice.\n\nYou met yourself here today. That's the real work.",
  "system8": "Yeah\u2026 I felt that click, like I caught up with myself for once instead of racing ahead. I\u2019m going to try to stay in that room\u2014breathing, not fixing. Thanks for walking me back to it.",
  "user8": "Staying in that room. That's the whole thing right there.\n\nTake care.",
  "system9": "Exactly\u2014just stay in the room. I\u2019ll keep practicing. Take care, and thank you for holding the space.",
  "user9": "You already know how. Just keep coming back to the room.\n\nTake care.",
  "system10": "Back to the room\u2014got it. See you there.",
  "user10": "See you there.",
  "system11": "See you there.",
  "user11": "See you there.",
  "system12": "See you there.",
  "user12": "See you there.",
  "system13": "See you there.",
  "user13": "See you there.",
  "system14": "I\u2019ve been thinking about that simple instruction all week\u2014just stay in the room\u2014and how hard it actually is for me. Like, even when I\u2019m physically with Emma and Noah, half my brain is composing tomorrow\u2019s email or reviewing my intention list for the ceremony. I keep catching myself leaving the room without moving an inch.  \n\nSo every time I notice, I gently bring myself back: feel my feet, breathe, let the laptop stay closed. Does that count as staying, or am I still \u201cperforming presence\u201d? I can\u2019t tell anymore\u2026 but I\u2019m practicing.",
  "user14": "That's the work. Noticing you're gone and coming back - that's staying.\n\nThe performance feeling fades. Keep practicing.",
  "system15": "That actually makes me feel a little weepy\u2014like, maybe I\u2019m not failing at this. I keep thinking if I\u2019m aware of the performance, it\u2019s fake, but maybe the noticing IS the real part. I\u2019ll keep coming back. Thank you.",
  "user15": "The noticing is real. The weepy feeling too.\n\nKeep coming back.",
  "system16": "I will. I\u2019m landing in that weepy place\u2014letting myself feel it instead of analyzing why I\u2019m feeling it. I can almost hear my grandmother saying, \u201cGood, bubeleh, stay with it.\u201d So I\u2019m staying.",
  "user16": "That's it. Stay with your grandmother's voice, stay with the feeling.\n\nLet the tears do their work.",
  "system17": "I'm sitting with it... letting the tears come without rushing to understand them. Her voice feels so close right now\u2014like she's reminding me that some things only soften when we stop trying to fix them. I'm here. I'm staying.",
  "user17": "Good. Let the fixing go.\n\nJust breathe and let her hold you.",
  "system18": "I\u2019m breathing\u2026 letting the fixing dissolve into just being held. It\u2019s terrifying and sweet at the same time\u2014like I\u2019m allowed to rest in something bigger than my lists and plans. I can feel my shoulders dropping; I didn\u2019t know how tight I was. I\u2019m here, Grandma, I\u2019m here.",
  "user18": "Feel those shoulders drop. Feel the sweet terror.\n\nRest in what holds you.",
  "system19": "I\u2019m\u2026 I don\u2019t even have words right now, just breath and this ache that\u2019s softening. The terror\u2019s still there but it\u2019s quieter, like it\u2019s settling beside me instead of driving me. I feel held by something I can\u2019t optimize or schedule, and for once I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m just resting in it.",
  "user19": "Just breathe. Let the ache soften more.\n\nRest in what you can't control."
