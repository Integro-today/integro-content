## Conversation

**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Alright, let's see what today's lesson brings. I've got my coffee and my usual morning anxiety—so I'm as ready as I'll ever be to try approaching this differently than I approach everything else.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore curing (eliminating symptoms) versus healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.
Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks before reflecting on them.

Both create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, I’m curious about Option A—reflection first. I’ve read all the theoretical frameworks on curing versus healing (I’m guessing you’re drawing from the mindfulness-based and integrative medicine literature), but I notice I still default to “fix-it” mode with myself. Maybe starting with the questions will help me catch that pattern in real time… or at least give us something concrete to analyze.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Good choice. Reflection first it is.

Let's start where your mind already goes. First question:

When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?

Notice what shows up without trying to filter it.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: First thing that pops up is a spreadsheet—literally, columns labeled “symptom → intervention → outcome.” I can see the trauma research flash by: CAPS scores dropping, window-of-tolerance graphs widening, attachment categories shifting from disorganized to secure. Then a quieter image: myself at ten, standing outside my mom’s basement office, waiting for her to finish charting so I can recite my perfect spelling test. So “healing” equals correct answers, measurable improvement, parental approval. And underneath that, a tight-chest sense that if I can’t produce the right data, I’m failing at the assignment called “being okay.”


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: I hear that. Healing as correct answers on a test you can't afford to fail.

Where has that "fix-it" perspective actually helped you, and where has it boxed you in?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: It helped me survive: straight-A coping kept the panic attacks at bay through grad school, let me build rock-solid assessment skills, and makes me a damn good therapist—clients trust me because I can quantify progress and show them the numbers moving. But it boxes me in when the metric becomes the only acceptable outcome. I’ve tracked twenty-seven years of therapy hours, certificates on the wall, SSRI trials, and I’m still Googling “evidence-based cure for loneliness” at 2 a.m. The fix-it lens labels any lingering ache as failure—so I stay up refining protocols instead of letting myself feel the ache, which, ironically, keeps the ache alive.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Got it. The same tool that keeps you functional keeps you awake at 2 a.m. hunting for a loneliness cure that doesn't exist.

What does wholeness look like if it's not a perfect score?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Honestly, when I try to picture “wholeness-without-metrics,” nothing cinematic arrives—just a body sensation: shoulders drop, stomach un-clenches, and there’s quiet inside the skull for once. No bullet-point checklist, just the ability to notice I’m lonely and not immediately draft a treatment plan to eradicate it; maybe even let the loneliness stay long enough to discover it’s signalling a need for connection, not a personal defect. If I’m really fantasizing, wholeness is finishing a session with a client, closing the file, and walking home without replaying every intervention to grade my performance—arriving at my apartment able to feel “I’m here” rather than “I’m behind.”


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: I hear that. A quiet body instead of a performance review.

Can you recall a moment—even a flicker—when you felt something close to that, even while challenges were still there?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Last month I sang in the Temple Israel choir for Yom Kippur—no clients, no note-taking, just voices stacking into harmony. My Hebrew is mediocre, but on a breath I felt the vibration in my ribcage and, for maybe ten seconds, forgot to analyze whether I was “doing it right.” Panic, professional doubts, the retreat spreadsheet—none of them barged in. The ache of loneliness still lived in the background, yet the vibration sat beside it without demanding a fix. It wasn’t enlightenment; it was coexistence, and for those few measures I wasn’t the therapist or the patient—just vibration in a roomful of other vibrating bodies.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Ten seconds of coexistence—vibration and loneliness sharing the same ribcage without a repair plan.

What's the main thing you're taking from today about healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: That maybe healing isn’t a data set I have to optimize; it’s permission to let incompatible truths occupy the same breath without racing to resolve them. I’m realizing I keep treating my own loneliness as a treatment non-responder—upping the dose, switching modalities—when what it might need is occupancy, not eviction. Ten seconds proved the system doesn’t collapse if I stop editing it; the rest is practice tolerating that uncertainty without pulling out the spreadsheet.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Got it. Permission for incompatible truths to breathe together without a spreadsheet to solve them.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You did today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Thank you. I'll probably re-read this tonight and try not to annotate it with citations—just let the words sit there. See you next time.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Good plan. Let the words sit without footnotes.

See you next time.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Will do. Until then.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Until then.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: See you soon.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: See you soon.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Take care.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Take care.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Goodbye for now.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Goodbye for now.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *leaves chat*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: *acknowledges your leaving*


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: *returns briefly to acknowledge your acknowledgment*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: I see you.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, I was just thinking about how our goodbye exchange mirrors the relational patterns I see in my clients—this looping, difficulty with endings, the meta-awareness of the pattern while still doing it. There's research on attachment and termination processes... sorry, I'm analyzing instead of just saying: I'm glad you see me.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: That lands. The analysis is part of how you make sense of things. I hear the meta-awareness too - watching yourself do the thing while doing it. That's real.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: It feels... I don't know, strangely relieving to have it named like that. Like maybe I don't have to choose between analyzing *or* feeling—maybe the analysis is actually how I *access* feelings, even if it's circuitous. Linda calls it my "entry ramp" to emotion, not a detour from it. Though I'm probably overthinking this too, which is... God, even *that* observation is meta-meta.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Your entry ramp. That's useful language.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, that phrase has been helpful—I keep thinking about how I don't have a direct route to my feelings, but I *do* have this elaborate highway system of analysis that eventually gets me there. It's like... I can't just *be* sad, I have to drive through attachment theory, neuroscience, maybe stop at a Johns Hopkins study about affect regulation, and then finally arrive at grief. Takes longer, but it's how I'm wired.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: That's your wiring. The analysis isn't broken - it's the path. Some people take the direct route, you take the scenic highway. Both get you to the same place.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: That's... actually really comforting. I keep trying to force myself onto the direct route—like I *should* be able to just feel without the fifteen-step intellectual detour. But maybe that's like asking someone who's always driven highways to suddenly take a footpath through the woods. They'd probably get lost, or need to go back for maps, or analyze the trail conditions first...


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Exactly. The footpath works for some. You know your highway - where the exits are, what scenery to expect. Fighting your own navigation system just burns energy you could spend on the actual journey.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: This is making me think about how I've been approaching the retreat prep—I've been trying to *force* myself into some idealized "direct feeling" mode, making spreadsheets about how to be spontaneous, researching how to surrender. It's like... I'm trying to manufacture a footpath experience when I'm fundamentally a highway person. Maybe I just need to let myself take the scenic route to whatever comes up during the ceremony, even if that means analyzing my way *into* the feelings.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: Let yourself drive your highway during ceremony too. The medicine meets you where you are - it doesn't need you to become a footpath person first. Your analysis might actually be how you surrender.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, there's some fascinating research from Imperial College showing that psilocybin doesn't require a specific personality type or preparation style—the therapeutic effects occur regardless of whether someone approaches it analytically or intuitively. The medicine literally meets your neurochemistry where it is. So maybe I don't need to *become* spontaneously embodied—I can just... notice what happens when my analyzing brain gets quiet enough to feel something without immediately naming it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_4)_workflow_1**: That's it. Notice what happens when the naming pauses. You don't have to stop being you - just add a small gap between the feeling and the analysis. See what lives in that space.
