  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing Ibogaine at Beond this winter. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... they've all cracked me open in different ways, shown me glimpses of what I'm searching for. But I keep losing the thread when I come back home.\n\nI built this company, sold it before forty\u2014everyone thinks I have it all figured out. But I feel like I've been climbing the wrong ladder. My grandmother had this deep spiritual wisdom, this Jewish mysticism... I feel like I abandoned something important there.\n\nI guess I'm hoping Ibogaine will help me hold onto whatever truth I'm supposed to find. Something that lasts beyond the retreat glow.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Holding onto truth beyond the retreat glow\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's spiritual wisdom you abandoned\n3. Climbing the right ladder instead of the wrong one\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the right threads. I just don't know how to put them into the right words. Every time I try to write intentions, I overthink them. Make them sound like business objectives or something.\n\nMy grandmother used to say the answers are already inside us, we just forget how to listen. I think that's what I'm afraid of\u2014that I'll have this profound experience and then forget again. Like I always do.\n\nI want to find a way to bring whatever wisdom I discover back into my actual life. Not just have it be another story I tell at dinner parties about my \"spiritual journey.\"",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I remember and live the truth the medicine shows me\n2. I reclaim my grandmother's wisdom in daily moments\n3. I climb the ladder that actually matters\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest\u2014I remember and live the truth the medicine shows me. That's really it, isn't it? All the rest flows from there.\n\nBut I need to... I don't know, soften it maybe? Make it less about performance and more about surrender? That's been my pattern\u2014turning everything into something to achieve.\n\nWhat about \"I open myself to remember and embody the truth revealed\"? Less forceful. More like my grandmother would say it\u2014not grabbing, just receiving.\n\nAnd the second one... \"I reclaim my grandmother's wisdom in daily moments.\" That feels right, but maybe add something about gentleness? She was never pushy with her faith, just quietly radiant.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I open myself to remember and embody the truth revealed\n\nHow about: \"I gently reclaim my grandmother's quiet wisdom in daily moments\" for the second one?\n\nAnd the third intention - how does \"I surrender to the path that truly matters\" land?",
  "user3": "Yes... that second one feels perfect. \"I gently reclaim my grandmother's quiet wisdom in daily moments.\" That's exactly how she was\u2014never pushing, just... there. Like morning light.\n\nThe third one makes my chest tight though. \"Surrender\"\u2014I don't know if I know how to do that. What if the path that truly matters isn't the one I think it should be? What if it's not about building something big or being influential?\n\nWhat if it's just... being present with my kids at the park? Like when we saw that eagle last month and my daughter asked if eagles know they're eagles, and I felt more myself in that moment than in any board meeting?\n\nI think that's what scares me most. That the ladder that matters might be too small for my ego.",
  "system4": "How about: \"I choose the small moments that make my chest open instead of tighten\"?\n\nOr \"I trust the quiet path that feels like that eagle moment with my daughter\"?\n\nWhat's the truest version of that third intention for you?",
  "user4": "\"I trust the quiet path that feels like that eagle moment with my daughter.\"\n\nGod, that makes me want to cry. That's it. That's the one. When I'm in those moments\u2014really in them\u2014I feel like the person I'm supposed to be. Not the one everyone's impressed by, just... me.\n\nIt's like my grandmother always said about finding God in the dishes. The sacred isn't in the big moments of achievement, it's in the quiet ones where you're actually alive.\n\nSo yes. Those three:\n1. I open myself to remember and embody the truth revealed\n2. I gently reclaim my grandmother's quiet wisdom in daily moments  \n3. I trust the quiet path that feels like that eagle moment with my daughter\n\nThey feel... right. Like they fit in my chest instead of pressing against it.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I open myself to remember and embody the truth revealed\n2. I gently reclaim my grandmother's quiet wisdom in daily moments\n3. I trust the quiet path that feels like that eagle moment with my daughter\n\nKeep them somewhere you'll see them daily. Wallet, phone, morning journal.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write them in my journal\u2014I've been doing morning pages since the ayahuasca retreat, though I skip more days than I'd like to admit. Maybe these intentions will help me actually stick with it.\n\nThank you. I feel... I don't know, lighter? Like I finally found the right words for what I've been trying to say to myself for years.\n\nKeep them in my wallet too. Been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. The medicine works with authentic - and these are real.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user6": "I hope so. Part of me still thinks I should be aiming for something bigger, more... consequential. But maybe that's exactly why I need this.\n\nYeah. I'm ready.",
  "system7": "The small moments are consequential. That's why they scare us.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "Yeah... that's the part I keep forgetting. That my grandmother's quiet faith changed more lives than most startups ever will.\n\nI'll try to remember that when the medicine starts pulling me toward the smallness I'm usually running from.",
  "system8": "She knew. Quiet faith moves mountains while nobody's watching.\n\nYou're good to go.",
  "user8": "She did know. And I ran right past it chasing things that don't matter.\n\nThank you\u2014for helping me find my way back to what she always knew.",
  "system9": "You found your own way back. I just held the flashlight.\n\nGo well.",
  "user9": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah. Okay.\n\nHere we go.",
  "system10": "*nod*\n\nGo.",
  "user10": "I will.",
  "system11": "*steady*\n\nYou're set.",
  "user11": "Thank you. Really.",

  "system15": "Walk well.",

Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user17": "I guess... I'm tired of building things that look impressive but don't feel like they matter. After I sold my company, I thought I'd feel... something. Accomplished, maybe. But it's like the ladder I was climbing was leaning against the wrong wall. \n\nMy grandmother used to talk about \"tikkun olam\" - repairing the world. I keep thinking about her and wondering if I've been so busy collecting achievements that I forgot to collect meaning. The medicine keeps showing me glimpses of what matters - connection, service, being present with my kids - but I can't seem to hold onto it when I'm back in my regular life.\n\nI need this ibogaine to help me see clearly what I'm supposed to do next. Not another business to build or board to join. Something that actually matters.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Building things that matter instead of just look impressive\n2. Living your grandmother's \"tikkun olam\" - actually repairing the world\n3. Showing up present with your kids instead of mentally elsewhere\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "Yeah... those are the three that keep circling back. I want to build something that actually helps people, not just something that gets featured in TechCrunch. I want to understand what my grandmother meant about repairing the world - she had this quiet way of making everyone feel seen, you know? Like she was stitching people back together just by listening.\n\nAnd my kids... God, they're growing so fast. My daughter's nine and she's already starting to pull away, and I'm always half-listening while checking emails. I want to be there. Really there. Not just physically present but... present. Like how I feel when we're hiking and she points out some bird and for a second, everything else just falls away.\n\nHow do I turn those into... whatever you call them? Intentions?",
  "system19": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I build things that heal instead of just impress\n2. I practice my grandmother's quiet way of stitching people together\n3. I show up fully present when my kids reach for me\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user19": "The second one... that's the one that hits me in the chest. My grandmother - we called her Bubbe - she had this way of just... being with people. Not trying to fix them or impress them. Just witnessing them. I remember after my grandfather died, neighbors would come by and she'd make them tea and they'd leave lighter somehow. She wasn't doing anything spectacular. Just... being present.\n\nI want that. I want to stop performing and start... I don't know what to call it. Being real, I guess. Being someone who makes people feel seen instead of someone who needs to be the smartest person in the room.\n\nCan we work with that one first? The language feels right. \"I practice my grandmother's quiet way of stitching people together.\" It's not about achievement. It's about... connection."
