  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_v5",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... whatever's going on with me. I guess I just need to sleep better. That's all.",
  "system1": "Sleep's a good place to start.\n\nWhat happens when you try to sleep now?",
  "user1": "I... I wake up sweating. Can't breathe. Sometimes I hear things that aren't there\u2014explosions, engines failing. My wife Amanda, she says I shout in my sleep. Scares her. I hate that.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Stop scaring Amanda with my shouting\n3. Feel safe in my own bed again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "Yeah. That about sums it up. I just want to be able to close my eyes without... all that coming back. And I need Amanda to feel safe next to me again.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me again\n3. I reclaim my bed as a place of rest, not war\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The second one. Making Amanda feel safe\u2014that's what matters most. I can't keep doing this to her.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I make Amanda feel safe beside me again*\n\nHow about the other two?",
  "user4": "They're all pretty much the same thing, aren't they? If I stop waking up screaming, Amanda sleeps better. If I can actually rest, maybe I won't be so... on edge all the time.",
  "system5": "They connect, but each holds something different.\n\nThe first is about your body finding rest. The third is about your relationship to sleep itself - making your bed a place of peace instead of battle.\n\nKeep all three?",
  "user5": "Yeah. All three. Makes sense when you put it like that.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make Amanda feel safe beside me again  \n3. I reclaim my bed as a place of rest, not war\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Got it. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system7": "Good plan. Your wallet's been through everything with you - makes sense your intentions live there too.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user7": "Yeah. Been through a lot together, that wallet and me. Guess we'll see if these words can do what all the discipline and routine couldn't.",
  "system8": "The words aren't doing the work - they're just pointing you toward what matters. The medicine will handle the rest.\n\nTrust what's coming.",
  "user8": "Trust. Right. That's the hard part, isn't it? Trusting something I can't control.",
  "system9": "Control gives the illusion of safety. Trust gives you actual movement forward.\n\nOne's exhausting. The other frees up your hands for what comes next.",
  "user9": "I've been running on that illusion for years. Guess it's time to find out what happens when I stop gripping everything so damn tight.",
  "system10": "You'll find out. Loosen your grip on this trip - see what your hands are actually meant to hold.\n\nThe wallet's ready. You're ready.",
  "user10": "Three weeks. Then we'll see what these hands were built for.",
  "system11": "Three weeks. The countdown starts now.\n\nKeep breathing. Keep showing up. The rest unfolds.",
  "user11": "Breathing. Yeah. Been doing that my whole life, but somehow it feels different when you're actually paying attention to it.",
  "system12": "Attention changes everything. Even something you've done automatically for decades becomes new when you actually show up for it.\n\nKeep paying attention. That's all that's required.",
  "user12": "Showing up. That's... that's what I haven't been doing, have I? Just going through the motions. Wake up, run, work, dinner, TV, nightmares. Repeat.",
  "system13": "You've been physically present but checked out. The medicine will show you what showing up actually feels like - in your body, with Amanda, in your own life.\n\nThe autopilot's about to break.",
  "user13": "Good. Let it break. I'm tired of watching my own life from the sidelines.",
  "system14": "Then step in. Three weeks to trade spectator for participant.\n\nThe sidelines end here.",
  "user14": "Three weeks to stop being a ghost in my own damn life. I can do this.",
  "system15": "You can. Ghosts don't breathe - you just remembered how.\n\nLet the living begin.",
  "user15": "Living. Haven't felt truly alive in... hell, I don't know how long. Just existing. Surviving. But surviving isn't the same as living, is it?",
  "system16": "No, it's not. Surviving keeps your heart beating. Living makes it beat for something.\n\nThree weeks to find what makes it beat again.",
  "user16": "What if I don't remember how to live? What if I've forgotten what my heart even beats for anymore?",
  "system17": "That's what the medicine's for - to remind you what your pulse already knows.\n\nYou haven't forgotten. You just stopped listening.",
  "user17": "Stopped listening... yeah. To everything. To Amanda when she tries to reach me. To my kids laughing. Even to my own body screaming at night. Just... tuned it all out.",
  "system18": "Time to tune back in. The static's about to clear.\n\nWhat happens when you hear again?",
  "user18": "I don't know. Haven't heard anything real in so long, just noise. Static. Maybe... maybe I'll hear Amanda's voice without flinching. Maybe I'll hear my kids laughing and not feel like I have to leave the room.",
  "system19": "Three threads:\n\n1. Hear Amanda's voice without flinching\n2. Stay in the room when my kids laugh\n3. Listen to my body instead of numbing it\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user19": "I want to hear Amanda without my chest tightening up. Want to feel something when my kids laugh instead of... instead of whatever this emptiness is. Want to stop pretending my body isn't screaming at me every damn night."
