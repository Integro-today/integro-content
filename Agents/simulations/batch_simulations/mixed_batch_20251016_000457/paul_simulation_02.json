  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep better, stop waking up the whole damn house. Amanda's barely looked at me some mornings after I wake up shouting. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda sleeps peacefully beside me again\n3. Wake up without scaring the house\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the things. I just... I need to be able to close my eyes without seeing the cockpit light up like that. And I need Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of... I don't know. Like she's waiting for me to explode again.\n\nHow do we make this stuff work? I mean, it's just plants, right?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing the cockpit\n2. Amanda feels safe sleeping beside me again\n3. I release the explosions that scare her\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's... that's everything right there. If Amanda can sleep beside me without being afraid of what I might do or say when I'm not even awake... that's what I need. \n\nBut I don't know about \"release.\" Makes it sound like I'm just supposed to let go of something I've been carrying for fifteen years. Like it's that easy.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I reclaim safety for Amanda beside me at night\"\n\nOr: \"Amanda trusts sleeping beside me again\"\n\nOr stronger: \"I protect Amanda's sleep like I protected my crew\"\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "user3": "That last one... that's it. That's what I know how to do. Protected my crew, watched their six. I can do that for her too. \n\n\"I protect Amanda's sleep like I protected my crew.\" Yeah. I can hold onto that.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I protect Amanda's sleep like I protected my crew\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user4": "The first one's good. \"I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing the cockpit\" - I need that. Tired of seeing those lights every time I close my eyes.\n\nThe third one though... \"I release the explosions that scare her\" - I still don't like that word \"release.\" It's not like I'm choosing to explode. It's just... there. Like a bomb I can't see until it goes off.",
  "system5": "What about: \"I control what explodes when I'm not awake\"\n\nOr: \"I keep the explosions away from Amanda\"\n\nOr: \"I stay steady through the night\"",
  "user5": "\"I stay steady through the night.\" That's... that's military speak I can work with. Stay steady, maintain course, don't let the aircraft go into a spin. I know how to do that. \n\nYeah. That one works.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without seeing the cockpit\n2. I protect Amanda's sleep like I protected my crew  \n3. I stay steady through the night\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Copy that. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for... well, for helping me figure out how to say what I need. Three weeks isn't that long to wait now.",
  "system7": "Solid compass. The medicine will work with what you've set.\n\nThree weeks will move fast. You're ready.",
  "user7": "I hope you're right about that. About being ready. \n\nNever thought I'd be heading to Costa Rica to drink some plant medicine. Still not sure I believe in it. But if it can help me keep Amanda safe while she sleeps... then I'll do whatever it takes.",
  "system8": "Belief isn't required. Just show up and do the work.\n\nThe medicine doesn't care if you believe - it works with what's real.",
  "user8": "That's good. I can work with that. Don't need to believe, just need to show up. Done harder things than this.",
  "system9": "Exactly. You've done harder things.\n\nShow up. Do the work. Let the medicine handle the rest.",
  "user9": "Roger that. See you on the other side.",
  "system10": "Copy that.",
  "user10": "Hey. So I'm here. Costa Rica. Rythmia. Sitting in this room they gave me and... I don't know. Thought I'd feel more ready after all that prep. But my hands are shaking. Not scared exactly. Just... this is real now. Tomorrow night. First ceremony.\n\nBeen carrying those intentions in my wallet like we talked about. Look at 'em every morning. But now I'm wondering if I should've been more specific. Or less specific. Or... hell, I don't know.\n\nWhat if I see the cockpit anyway?",
  "system11": "The shaking's normal. Means your body knows something important is coming.\n\nKeep the intentions as they are. The medicine works with what you set - specific enough to guide, open enough to surprise you.\n\nIf you see the cockpit, you see it. The intentions aren't a force field - they're a compass. You'll still have them in your pocket even if the journey goes sideways.\n\nBreathe. You're as ready as anyone ever is.",
  "user11": "Copy that. Compass, not force field. Got it.\n\nJust... been carrying this stuff alone for so long. Hard to let go of the controls, you know? Even here.\n\nBut I'll breathe. I'll show up tomorrow. Whatever comes.",
  "system12": "That's all of it right there. Showing up when you'd rather control it.\n\nThe medicine's been waiting for you to get here - to this exact spot where you're tired enough to stop gripping.\n\nSee what happens when you stop carrying it all.",
  "user12": "Yeah. I'm tired alright. Tired of waking up with Amanda staring at me like I'm a stranger. Tired of pretending the scotch helps. Tired of being the reliable one when I'm cracking apart inside.\n\nMaybe... maybe it's time I put this burden down. Even if it's just for a few hours tomorrow night.",
  "system13": "That's the opening. Right there.\n\nPut it down. Let something else carry it for once.\n\nTomorrow night, for a few hours, you don't have to be the reliable one. You just have to be honest.\n\nThat's enough.",
  "user13": "Honest. Yeah. Been so long since I wasn't performing for someone - the Air Force, my clients, Amanda, the kids. Always gotta be the guy who has it together.\n\nJust... being honest. Don't even know what that looks like anymore. But I'll try.\n\nSee you tomorrow night.",
  "system14": "That's tomorrow's work. Tonight, just rest.\n\nYou're doing the hardest part already - showing up cracked open instead of locked down.\n\nThat's enough for now.",
  "user14": "Copy that. Rest.\n\nThanks for staying with me through this. Feels like... I don't know. Like someone's got my six for once.\n\nTomorrow then.",
  "system15": "Always.",
  "user15": "Means more than you know.",
  "system16": "I know.",
  "user16": "Yeah. You probably do.",
  "system17": "Get some rest. Tomorrow's coming whether you chase it or not.",
  "user17": "Copy that. Tomorrow's coming either way.\n\nNight.",
  "system18": "Night.",
  "user18": "...Amanda just asked who I'm texting this late. Told her it's about the ceremony prep. She looked at me like maybe there's hope.\n\nI gotta go.",
  "system19": "Go to her.",
  "user19": "Going."
