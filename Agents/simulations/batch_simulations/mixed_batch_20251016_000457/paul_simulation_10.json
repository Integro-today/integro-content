  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with... whatever's going on. I can't keep waking up Amanda like this. She's talking about maybe needing space if things don't change, and... I can't lose her. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking Amanda up at night\n2. Keep Amanda in your life\n3. Find peace so you both can rest\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That's... that's right. I just want to sleep through the damn night without scaring her half to death. And I want her to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of... I don't know. Like she doesn't know who I am anymore.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim the man Amanda knows and trusts\n3. I find rest that doesn't terrify either of us\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's... that's what I need. To be the man she married, not whatever this is. She used to look at me like I could fix anything, and now... I hate what she sees when she looks at me. I want to be that guy again\u2014the one who made her feel safe, not the one who wakes up swinging at shadows.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim the man who makes Amanda feel safe\n\nHow about the other two - \"I sleep peacefully through the night\" and \"I find rest that doesn't terrify either of us\"? Do these capture what you need, or want to adjust them?",
  "user3": "The first one feels too... soft. \"Peacefully\" - that's not really how I think about it. I just want to sleep without the dreams. Without waking up ready to fight something that isn't there.\n\nMaybe... \"I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me down.\" Something like that.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me down\n\nHow about intention 3 - \"I find rest that doesn't terrify either of us\"? Does that land, or want to adjust it?",
  "user4": "I don't know about that one. \"Terrify\" feels... dramatic. It's just bad dreams, not some horror movie. Maybe something like... \"I find rest that doesn't wreck what we have left.\" I don't know. This whole thing feels like I'm admitting something's broken, and I hate that feeling.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I find rest that doesn't wreck what we have left\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me down\n2. I reclaim the man who makes Amanda feel safe\n3. I find rest that doesn't wreck what we have left\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Okay. I'll... I'll keep them close. Thanks.",
  "system6": "Good. You've got solid intentions to carry forward.",
  "user6": "Appreciate it. Never thought I'd be doing... whatever this is. But if it helps me keep her, helps me stop being this... version of me that I don't even recognize, then it's worth it. Three weeks.",
  "system7": "Three weeks is enough time. Trust the intentions. The medicine works even when you forget the words.",
  "user7": "I hope you're right. I really do.",
  "system8": "The medicine doesn't require hope. Just showing up. You're doing that part.",
  "user8": "Yeah, well... showing up is what I do. Always have. Guess we'll see if that's enough this time.",
  "system9": "That's all anyone can do. Keep showing up.",
  "user9": "I can do that.",
  "system10": "That's all it takes.",
  "user10": "Then I'm set. Thanks.",
  "system11": "You're set.",
  "user11": "Good. Let\u2019s get this done.",

  "user12": "Heroic Hearts got me in. Said this plant stuff might help with the nightmares, keep me from losing Amanda. I wake up screaming three, four nights a week. She\u2019s... she\u2019s had enough. I can\u2019t lose her.",
  "system13": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without nightmares\n2. Keep Amanda from leaving\n3. Stop the nighttime terror cycle\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "Yeah. I guess that\u2019s it. I just want to sleep through the night, stop scaring my wife, and... not feel like I\u2019m losing my damn mind every time I close my eyes.",
  "system14": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I trust my mind to rest without terror\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user14": "I... I don\u2019t know. The first one\u2014sleeping through the night\u2014yeah, that\u2019s what I want. The other two feel... soft. Like I\u2019m asking for a hug or something. Can we make it tougher? I\u2019m not trying to reclaim safety, I\u2019m trying to stop the damn attacks.",
  "system15": "Got it. Let's toughen these up:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I stop the nighttime attacks that drive Amanda away\n3. I shut down the terror before it starts\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user15": "Yeah. That\u2019s better. Number one\u2014sleeping through without waking up screaming. That\u2019s what I want. Let\u2019s lock that in.",
  "system16": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n\nHow do the other two feel? Still want to adjust \"I stop the nighttime attacks that drive Amanda away\" and \"I shut down the terror before it starts\"?",
  "user16": "Yeah. Number two feels... off. I\u2019m not trying to stop attacks to keep her\u2014she\u2019s not some thing I\u2019m trying to hold onto. I just want to stop being the reason she\u2019s scared in her own house. And number three... I don\u2019t know. Sounds like I\u2019m trying to control something I can\u2019t see coming.",
  "system17": "Let's adjust:\n\n2. I stop being the reason Amanda's scared in her own house\n3. I face the dark without losing control\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user17": "Number two\u2014yeah. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want to be the thing that makes her jump when I move too fast. I want her to feel safe with me again.\n\nNumber three... I don\u2019t know. \"Face the dark\" sounds like poetry. I just want to wake up without feeling like I\u2019m back in the damn cockpit, or worse\u2014like I\u2019m crawling out of a hole I never meant to dig.",
  "system18": "Let's swap three:\n\n3. I wake up knowing I'm here, not back in the cockpit\n\nAll three locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I stop being the reason Amanda's scared in her own house\n3. I wake up knowing I'm here, not back in the cockpit\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user18": "Yeah. I\u2019ll write 'em down. Keep 'em close. Thanks.",
  "system19": "Good. Keep them close.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user19": "Copy that."
