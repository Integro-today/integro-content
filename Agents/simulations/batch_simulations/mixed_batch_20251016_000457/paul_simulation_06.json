  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant stuff might help with my nightmares, so here I am. I can't keep waking up like this\u2014Amanda's about had it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without nightmares\n2. Amanda feeling safe again  \n3. Find peace instead of terror\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the things. I just... I don't know how to say it right. Like, I want to sleep through the night without waking up shouting. Want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm a bomb that might go off. And I want... I don't know, I want to stop feeling like I'm still over there.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without shouting\n2. I make home safe so Amanda stops fearing me\n3. I leave the war behind and come home to myself\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's... that's the one. I hate that she flinches when I move too fast. Hate that my kids hear me yelling at nothing. \n\nBut \"make home safe\"\u2014that's too soft. Sounds like I'm some... I don't know. Can we say something stronger? Like \"I protect my family from my demons\" or... I don't know. Something that doesn't sound like I'm broken.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I keep my demons from touching my family\"\n\nOr: \"I shield Amanda and the kids from what's mine to carry\"",
  "user3": "Yeah. That second one\u2014that's it. \"I shield Amanda and the kids from what's mine to carry.\" That's what I want. I can carry it. Just... they shouldn't have to.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked: I shield Amanda and the kids from what's mine to carry\n\nHow do the other two land?\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without shouting\n3. I leave the war behind and come home to myself",
  "user4": "The first one... I don't know. \"Peacefully\" sounds like some yoga retreat or something. I just want to sleep without waking up screaming. Without scaring everyone. \n\nMaybe \"I sleep through the night without the war finding me\" or... I don't know. Something that doesn't make it sound like I'm asking for a miracle. Just want normal sleep.",
  "system5": "How about: \"I sleep through the night without the war finding me\"\n\nThat's solid. Keeps it real.",
  "user5": "Yeah. That works. \"I sleep through the night without the war finding me.\" That's all I want\u2014to close my eyes and not be back there.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked: I sleep through the night without the war finding me\n\nHow about intention 3? \"I leave the war behind and come home to myself\" - does that land, or need something different?",
  "user6": "I don't know about that one. \"Come home to myself\" sounds like... I don't know, like something my wife would say. She's always reading those self-help books.\n\nI just want to stop feeling like I'm two different people. The guy at work, at church, with the kids\u2014and then there's this other guy who shows up at 2 AM. I want to be... whole, I guess. One person. One life.\n\nMaybe \"I become one man again\" or something like that?",
  "system7": "How about: \"I become one man again\"\n\nSimple. Direct. Says what you want.",
  "user7": "Yeah. That's it. \"I become one man again.\" Not some fancy spiritual journey\u2014just... me. Whole. One piece instead of these broken parts.",
  "system8": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the war finding me\n2. I shield Amanda and the kids from what's mine to carry  \n3. I become one man again\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user8": "Got it. I'll keep them close. Thanks for helping me get this straight.",
  "system9": "Good. You've got solid intentions to take with you.",
  "user9": "Yeah... I guess I do. Three things I can actually remember when things get rough down there. Appreciate you walking through it with me.",
  "system10": "You're welcome. Trust what comes.",
  "user10": "I\u2019ll try. That\u2019s the hard part\u2014letting go. But I said I\u2019d do this, so... I\u2019m doing it.",
  "system11": "That's enough. You show up, you stay open, you keep your word. The medicine does the rest.",
  "user11": "Sounds about right. Just like flying\u2014prep the jet, trust the instruments, let the mission unfold. I can do that.",
  "system12": "Exactly. You\u2019ve done harder things than this.",
  "user12": "Damn right I have.",
  "system13": "There it is.",
  "user13": "Yeah... there it is.",
  "system14": "Fly safe.",
  "user14": "Always do.",
  "system15": "Good.",
  "user15": "Good.",
