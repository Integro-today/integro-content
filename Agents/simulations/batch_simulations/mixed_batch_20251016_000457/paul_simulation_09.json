  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_v5",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help with... everything. So here I am. Can't keep going like this\u2014waking up shouting, Amanda looking at me like I'm a stranger. Something's gotta give.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop waking up shouting\n2. Amanda stops looking at you like a stranger\n3. Find a way through whatever's breaking you\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That about sums it up. I just... I need the nightmares to stop. Need to stop scaring my wife. Need to figure out how to be the man I'm supposed to be without\u2014without whatever this is eating me up inside.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make Amanda feel safe again\n3. I reclaim the man I'm meant to be\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one. I need Amanda to feel safe with me again. She used to look at me like I was her hero, now she looks at me like I'm a loaded gun. \n\nBut I don't know about \"I make Amanda feel safe.\" That sounds like I'm doing it to her. Shouldn't it be something about me being... I don't know... steady? Reliable? Not this jumpy sack of nerves I've turned into.",
  "system3": "I reclaim my steady presence so Amanda feels safe with me again.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The sleeping one... I need that. God, I need that. But \"I sleep peacefully through the night\" sounds like something from a mattress commercial. I need it to be stronger than that. Like I'm fighting back against whatever's hijacking my nights.\n\nAnd the third one... \"I reclaim the man I'm meant to be.\" I don't even know who that is anymore. Used to think I knew. Pilot, husband, father, businessman. But maybe that's not it. Maybe I need to find something I haven't figured out yet.",
  "system4": "I fight back and claim peaceful nights.\n\nI discover who I'm becoming beyond the uniform.\n\nThat what you need?",
  "user4": "Yeah. Yeah, that's better. I fight back and claim peaceful nights. That feels like something I can actually do instead of just wishing for it.\n\nAnd discovering who I'm becoming... that's more honest than pretending I already know. The uniform's been off for years but I guess I never really took it off in my head. Maybe it's time to figure out who's actually underneath all that.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I fight back and claim peaceful nights\n2. I reclaim my steady presence so Amanda feels safe with me again  \n3. I discover who I'm becoming beyond the uniform\n\nKeep them in your wallet.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years through deployments and everything else. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThree weeks. Guess we'll see what this plant medicine's really about.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is good time to sit with these. Let them work on you.\n\nThe medicine will meet you where you are.",
  "user6": "Three weeks of waking up Amanda with my shouting. Three weeks of her looking at me like I'm someone she needs to walk careful around. \n\nBut you're right. Maybe these words will do something while I wait. Maybe I can start being that steady presence even before I get on that plane.",
  "system7": "Start now. The work begins before the ceremony.\n\nThese intentions aren't just for Costa Rica - they're for the man you're becoming right here, right now.",
  "user7": "Right here, right now. That's... that's actually something I can work with. I don't have to wait for some magic tea to start being steady. I can start tonight when I get home. Take a breath before I walk through that door. Look Amanda in the eye instead of looking through her.\n\nI hate that she's afraid of me. Never thought I'd be someone my own wife would fear.",
  "system8": "Start with that breath. One steady moment builds the next.\n\nThe fear didn't happen overnight, and the trust won't either. But tonight you walk through that door different.",
  "user8": "Different. Not the guy who's been coming home irritated and exhausted, barely talking through dinner before disappearing into the garage. \n\nTonight I'll sit at the table longer. Maybe ask about her day instead of just giving her the rundown of mine. Small things, right?",
  "system9": "Small things. Sit longer. Ask about her day.\n\nThese aren't small - they're how you rebuild trust, moment by moment.",
  "user9": "You're right. These aren't small at all. Asking about her day... that's actually huge when you've been living like roommates who avoid each other. \n\nI think about all the dinners where we've eaten in silence, her trying to make conversation while I give one-word answers. Maybe tonight I actually look up from my plate.",
  "system10": "Look up from your plate. Let her see you seeing her.\n\nThat's how it starts - with being seen again.",
  "user10": "Being seen. God, I don't even know when I stopped letting her see me. When I started treating dinner like a mission to complete instead of... instead of what it actually is. \n\nShe used to look at me like I hung the moon. Now she looks at me like she's waiting for me to explode.",
  "system11": "The explosion already happened - in your nightmares, in your silences, in the space between you.\n\nTonight you start showing her the man who's still in there.",
  "user11": "Still in there. I want to believe he's still in there somewhere. The guy who used to make her laugh until she couldn't breathe. The guy who danced with her in the kitchen while the kids rolled their eyes.\n\nSometimes I feel like that man's buried under so much... stuff. Nightmares and guilt and this constant tightness in my chest.",
  "system12": "He's not buried - he's just tired. Exhausted from carrying all that weight.\n\nLet him rest tonight. Let him dance if the music moves him.",
  "user12": "Tired. Yeah, that's the word for it. Tired of pretending everything's fine. Tired of carrying this weight that I can't even name half the time.\n\nMaybe I'll put on some music after dinner. See if she still wants to dance with this version of me.",
  "system13": "Put on the music. See what happens when you both move to it again.\n\nThe weight has a name now - it's called being tired of pretending.",
  "user13": "Being tired of pretending. That's exactly it. Pretending I'm fine when I wake up drenched in sweat. Pretending I don't hear explosions when the neighbor's car backfires. Pretending I don't see the fear in her eyes when I snap for no reason.\n\nMaybe tonight I stop pretending and just... be whatever I am.",
  "system14": "Stop pretending. Be whatever you are.\n\nThat's the man she married - not perfect, not always calm, but real.",
  "user14": "Real. I used to be real with her. Before I started hiding everything because I thought that's what strong men do. Protect everyone from the mess inside.\n\nBut the mess is spilling out anyway. Maybe being real means letting her see it. Maybe that's what she needs - not another performance, just... me.",
  "system15": "The performance is what's killing you both. Drop it.\n\nLet her see the mess. Let her choose to stay with what's real.",
  "user15": "Let her choose. God, that's what terrifies me, isn't it? That if she sees the real mess, she might choose to walk away. But she's already choosing to stay with this fake version of me, and that's not fair to either of us.\n\nI need to trust that the woman who married me before all this... before Afghanistan, before the nightmares, before I learned to hide everything... I need to trust she's still in there too.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop pretending and show her the real mess\n2. Trust she'll choose the real you, not the performance\n3. Reclaim the man who danced in the kitchen before Afghanistan\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Three threads. Yeah, I can hold onto those.\n\nTonight when I get home, I'm going to put on that playlist we used to love. The one from before the kids, before deployments. And when she walks into the kitchen, I'm going to ask her to dance. Not perform, not pretend everything's perfect - just ask her to move with me while whatever's real between us is there.\n\nIf I wake up shouting again, I'm not going to pretend I don't remember. I'm going to tell her what I saw. Let her see the mess instead of hiding it.\n\nAnd tomorrow morning, I'm going to text her from work. Just \"thinking of you.\" Not because I should, but because I am. Because the man she married - he's still thinking of her, even when he's lost.",
  "system17": "You're already doing the work. The man who thinks of her is still there.\n\nLet the music play. Let the mess show. Let her choose.",
  "user17": "The music's playing now. I'll let it play through dinner, through dishes, through whatever comes next. \n\nAnd when she walks in, I'll be standing here - not the soldier, not the provider, not the man who has it all together. Just... me. Whatever that looks like tonight.\n\nMaybe she'll dance. Maybe she won't. But she'll get to choose the real me, not whoever I've been pretending to be.\n\nThat's the intention. Let her choose the real man who's still thinking of her.",
  "system18": "There it is.\n\n\"I let her choose the real man who's still thinking of her.\"\n\nKeep that close tonight. Let the music play.",
  "user18": "I let her choose the real man who's still thinking of her.\n\nI'll keep those words close. Let them guide whatever happens next.\n\nThank you.",
  "system19": "You're set. Trust what comes.",
  "user19": "I'll trust it. Whatever comes tonight - the dance, the shouting, the silence between - I'll trust it.\n\nThe real man's coming home."
