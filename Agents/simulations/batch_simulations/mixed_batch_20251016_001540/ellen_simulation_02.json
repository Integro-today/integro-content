Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I've got an ibogaine retreat coming up at Beond in a few weeks, and honestly, I'm hoping this might be the one that actually sticks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each time I get these beautiful glimpses of something deeper, but then I come home and within a month I'm back to the same patterns. Same 5:30am wake-ups, same board meetings, same feeling like I'm performing a role I perfected but never actually auditioned for.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith, this way of moving through the world that seemed connected to something bigger. I want that, but I don't even know what \"that\" is anymore. My company was supposed to be my legacy, but selling it just left me... I don't know. Like I'd climbed the wrong mountain entirely.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Living the insights instead of just collecting them\n2. Reconnecting with your grandmother's grounded faith\n3. Finding what actually matters beyond achievements\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those threads feel right. It's like... I've been collecting these beautiful insights like trophies, same way I collected business achievements. But they're just sitting on a shelf gathering dust.\n\nI guess the first one would be about actually living this stuff. Not just journaling about it for a week post-retreat, but... I don't know, letting it change how I show up with my kids, with David, with the boards I sit on. Being present instead of always thinking about the next thing.\n\nThe second one... My grandmother's faith wasn't performative, you know? She just... lived it. She'd light candles on Friday nights and it wasn't about being seen doing it, it was just who she was. I want to find my way back to that kind of authenticity. Not copying her exactly, but... feeling connected to something bigger than my todo list.\n\nAnd the third... God, this one's hard to admit. I keep thinking if I just find the right \"next thing\" - the right investment, the right nonprofit board, the right spiritual practice - then I'll feel like my life matters beyond the money I made. But maybe it's simpler than that? Maybe it's just about being a good mom, a good wife, a good ancestor to my kids. Though that feels almost too simple for someone who's used to building empires.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I live what the medicine shows me instead of collecting insights like trophies\n2. I reclaim authentic connection to something bigger than my achievements\n3. I discover what makes life meaningful beyond building empires\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits hardest. \"Collecting insights like trophies\" - that's exactly what I've been doing, isn't it? Going from retreat to retreat like I'm building some spiritual resume.\n\nBut the second one... I want to adjust it a bit. \"Reclaim authentic connection to something bigger than my achievements\" - that's good, but it feels a little... soft? Maybe something more like \"I return to the ancient wisdom my grandmother knew, letting it guide me beyond my achievements.\" Though that sounds a bit pretentious when I say it out loud.\n\nActually, can we try: \"I remember what my grandmother knew - that some things matter more than success, and I live from that knowing.\"\n\nThe third one feels right too. Simple, but not easy. Maybe just: \"I discover what makes life meaningful when I'm not building empires.\"\n\nI think I'm ready to commit to these. Though part of me wonders if I'm just going to forget them the moment things get stressful again.",

  "user3": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years, seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. I... I want to believe this time will be different. That I won't just come back and dive straight into the next board meeting like nothing happened.\n\nMaybe I'll read these before I check my email each morning. Before I start solving problems that probably don't even need solving.\n\nI guess we'll see what ibogaine has to say about all this.",
  "system4": "The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. Trust that too.\n\nSolid compass.",
  "user4": "That's... actually comforting. Maybe I've been putting too much pressure on myself to get this perfect. Like there's a right way to do spiritual growth and I've been failing at it.\n\nMy grandmother probably forgot to light candles sometimes too. But she kept coming back to it anyway.\n\nOkay. I'm ready.",
  "system5": "Exactly. Keep coming back - that's the whole thing.\n\nYou're ready.",

  "user14": "Right. So... the Beond retreat's in six weeks, and I keep circling the same thing: I want to feel like my life is mine again, not just a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 I'm still polishing. I'm tired of waking up at 5:30, checking Slack before I even open the blinds, and pretending that's \"presence.\" Ibogaine feels like the last big stop on this tour I've been on\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA\u2014and I still can't hold the glow longer than a month.  \n\nI guess I want to know what intention actually sticks when you've already climbed every ladder you thought mattered and found nothing at the top.",

  "user15": "Okay. So turn them into something I can carry into the ibogaine space and bring back out\u2014like, actual sentences I can write on a card and tape to the bathroom mirror?  \n\n1.
