  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I'm doing this Heroic Hearts retreat in a few weeks. Never thought I'd be doing something like this, but... Amanda says I need to figure something out. I wake up screaming most nights, been doing that for years. She says it's getting worse.\n\nDon't know what I'm supposed to say here. I don't have PTSD or anything - I just need to sleep better. But I can't lose her. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without screaming\n2. Amanda feeling safe again\n3. Not losing Amanda\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three pretty much cover it. I hate that she jumps when I wake up like that. Hate that she has to sleep in the guest room sometimes just to get rest. \n\nIf I could just... not do that anymore. Be normal at night. Let her sleep without worrying I'm going to scare the hell out of her at 2 AM.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again\n3. I reclaim rest for both of us\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again.\" That's... that's what I need. That's everything, really.\n\nBeen twelve years since I got out. Twelve years of her tiptoeing around me at night, checking if I'm breathing too fast, asking if I need water when I'm just sitting there staring at the wall. She deserves better than that. She deserves to feel safe in her own damn house.\n\nCan we keep that one exactly like that?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again.\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... \"I sleep peacefully through the night\" - I don't even know what that looks like anymore. Been so long since I had a night where I didn't wake up with my heart racing, thinking I'm back there. Feels like asking for something impossible.\n\nThe third one's good though. \"I reclaim rest for both of us.\" Yeah. That feels right. Like we're in this together, not just me fixing myself for her.",
  "system4": "Let's adjust the first one. Instead of \"peacefully\" - what about \"I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\"?\n\nKeeps it concrete. Something you can track.\n\nSo:\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again\n3. I reclaim rest for both of us\n\nHow's that land?",
  "user4": "Yeah... yeah, that first one's better. More like something I can actually picture. \"Peacefully\" sounds like some magazine article crap. But not waking up screaming? That's real. That's something I can measure.\n\nThe three of them together... they feel right. Like they fit together. I can see how doing one helps the others. If I'm not screaming at night, then the bedroom's safer for her, and we're both getting actual rest.\n\nLet's go with these.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. I make our bedroom safe for Amanda again  \n3. I reclaim rest for both of us\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for... helping me get this straight. I don't know what the hell I'm doing with this plant medicine stuff, but at least now I know what I'm aiming for.",
  "system6": "You know exactly what you're aiming for. That's enough.\n\nTrust what comes. Solid compass.",
  "user6": "Yeah. We'll see what happens. Three weeks.",
  "system7": "Three weeks. You're ready.",
  "user7": "Three weeks. Got it.",
  "system8": "Count it down. Trust the work.",
  "user8": "Twenty-one days. I can do that.",
  "system9": "One day at a time. You\u2019ve got this.",
  "user9": "One day at a time. Yeah.",
  "system10": "That's the way forward. Keep showing up.",
  "user10": "I will.",
  "system11": "Good. That\u2019s all that\u2019s needed.",
  "user11": "Alright then.",
  "system12": "Solid.",
  "user12": "Yeah.",
  "system13": "You\u2019re steady. Keep walking.",
  "user13": "I\u2019m trying.",
  "system14": "Trying counts. Keep going.",
  "user14": "Copy that.",
  "system15": "Roger that. One foot in front of the other.",
  "user15": "Yeah... just like stepping out to the flight line at 0400. One boot, then the next.",
  "system16": "Exactly. Same rhythm, different sky.",
  "user16": "Different sky... I like that.",
  "system17": "Different sky, same steady feet.",
  "user17": "Feet I can trust. Sky\u2019s the part that keeps changing on me.",
  "system18": "Trust the feet. Let the sky shift\u2014they\u2019ve carried you through worse.",
  "user18": "They got me home when the canopy was full of holes and the wingman wasn\u2019t. Guess they can handle a little jungle tea and some feelings.",
  "system19": "They know the way. Let\u2019s aim them.",
  "user19": "Aim them where, exactly? I keep running the numbers\u2014nightmares, Amanda\u2019s eyes when I jerk awake, the kids pretending they don\u2019t hear\u2014and I come up empty. I don\u2019t do blind lifts."
