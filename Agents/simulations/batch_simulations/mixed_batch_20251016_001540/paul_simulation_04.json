  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I got into Heroic Hearts. Ayahuasca retreat in Costa Rica in three weeks. Haven't told many people. Don't want to jinx it.\n\nAmanda\u2014my wife\u2014she says I need to do something. The nightmares, the... I wake up shouting sometimes. Scares her. Scares the kids. I hate that. Can't remember the last time I slept through the night.\n\nI don't know what I'm doing here. Don't believe in this plant medicine stuff. But I trust the guys at Heroic Hearts. They're veterans, they get it. And I can't lose her.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Stop scaring Amanda and the kids\n3. Keep your family together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are... yeah, that's it.\n\nI want to sleep without seeing their faces. Without hearing\u2014without waking up ready to fight something that isn't there.\n\nI want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm a bomb that might go off. Want to be someone my kids aren't afraid of when they're trying to wake me up.\n\nDon't want to lose what we built. This house, this life\u2014it's everything I fought for over there. Can't let it fall apart because I can't get my head right.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and the kids at home\n3. I protect what we built together\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I reclaim safety for Amanda and the kids at home.\" That's... that's what I need. That's what matters.\n\nBut I don't know about \"reclaim.\" Makes it sound like I lost it. Maybe... \"I create safety\" or \"I restore safety\"? I don't know. Something that doesn't make me sound so... broken.\n\nAnd the third one\u2014\"I protect what we built together.\" That feels right. Protecting's what I do. What I've always done. Just need to figure out how to protect them from me too.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I restore safety for Amanda and the kids at home.\"\n\nAnd for the third: \"I protect what matters most - our family, our home, our life together.\"\n\nSo all three:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n2. I restore safety for Amanda and the kids at home\n3. I protect what matters most - our family, our home, our life together\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user3": "They land... they land good. Real good.\n\n\"I restore safety\"\u2014yeah, that feels like something I can do. Something strong. Not about being broken, about fixing what needs fixing.\n\nAnd protecting what matters most... that's who I am. That's what I've always done. Just got to learn how to do it right here at home, not just out there.\n\nThese aren't weak words. These are mission words. Clear objectives.\n\nI can carry these. I can remember these when things get rough in there.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n2. I restore safety for Amanda and the kids at home  \n3. I protect what matters most - our family, our home, our life together\n\nKeep them with your dog tags or wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your mission parameters. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Roger that. I'll keep them in my wallet\u2014same place I keep the picture of Amanda and the kids from before my last deployment. Been looking at that every morning for years.\n\nMission parameters. I can work with that. Clear objectives, clear mission. Just... different terrain this time.\n\nAppreciate you keeping it straight with me. No fluff, no soft stuff. Just what I need to do.\n\nReady to move forward.",
  "system5": "Good. Trust the mission. The medicine will show you what you need to see.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "Copy that. \n\nI'll see you on the other side.",
  "system6": "See you there.",

  "user18": "Okay. Heroic Hearts says I need to set intentions before I ship out to Rythmia. I\u2019m here because Amanda\u2019s at her limit and I can\u2019t lose her. I don\u2019t talk about this stuff, but I\u2019ll listen.",
  "system19": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user19": "I wake up yelling, soaked in sweat, three, four nights a week. Amanda says she doesn\u2019t know the guy in bed next to her anymore. I need the dreams to stop and I need my wife back. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving this."
