  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_6",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "Look, Heroic Hearts says this might help with... with how things are going at home. Amanda's about had it with me. I wake up screaming, can't sleep through the night, and she's worried I'm gonna hurt somebody when I'm like that. I never would, but... I can't keep doing this to her.\n\nI don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff, but they seem to think it works. And I can't lose her. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without waking up screaming\n2. Amanda feels safe again\n3. Keep Amanda in your life\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. I guess those are it, aren't they? \n\nI want to sleep through the damn night without waking up like I'm back there. I want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of bomb that might go off. And I want... I want to keep her. Keep all of this we've built together.\n\nHow do we make these into whatever you call them - intentions?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n2. I make Amanda feel safe in our home again\n3. I keep the life Amanda and I have built together\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one - about Amanda feeling safe. That's the one that keeps me up at night, knowing she looks at me different now. Like she doesn't know who I am anymore.\n\nBut... I don't know about \"I make Amanda feel safe.\" That sounds like I'm doing something to her, you know? Like it's all on me to fix how she feels. Maybe it should be more about me being... steady. Or something. \n\nWhat do you think?",
  "system3": "How about: \"I show up steady and safe in our home again\"\n\nKeeps the focus on you being present without trying to control how she responds.",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that's better. I can control how I show up. Can't control how she feels about it, but I can damn well control what I bring into our house.\n\nI show up steady and safe in our home again. I like that.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show up steady and safe in our home again\n\nHow do the other two land?\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n3. I keep the life Amanda and I have built together",
  "user4": "The first one... I don't know. \"Peacefully\" sounds too soft, like something off a meditation app or whatever. And \"terror\" feels dramatic. I just want to sleep through the night without waking up drenched in sweat, that's all.\n\nNumber three feels too... I don't know. Too final? Like I'm clinging to something that might already be slipping away. Maybe it should be about protecting what matters, not keeping it like some kind of possession.\n\nI sleep through the night without the nightmares. How about that?",
  "system5": "\"I sleep through the night without the nightmares\" - better. Direct.\n\nFor the third one - \"I protect what Amanda and I have built together\" - that work?",
  "user5": "Yeah. That one works. I can protect it - that's what I've always done, right? Protected people. Protected my guys over there. Now I need to protect this - us - from whatever's eating me up inside.\n\nI protect what Amanda and I have built together.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the nightmares\n2. I show up steady and safe in our home again  \n3. I protect what Amanda and I have built together\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "I'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet - been carrying that thing for twenty years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate this.",
  "system7": "Good. The wallet works.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "I will. Hard part's trusting myself to handle whatever shows up, but... yeah. I'll trust it.",
  "system8": "That's the work. Trusting yourself to handle it - whatever it is.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user8": "Three weeks. Then I'm doing this thing. I don't know what's coming, but... I'm doing it anyway.",
  "system9": "That's how you know it's real - you don't know what's coming, but you're stepping in anyway.\n\nThree weeks. Let the intentions do their work.",
  "user9": "Yeah. Stepping in anyway - that's what we do, right?",
  "system10": "Exactly.",
  "user10": "Alright then. Let's get to it.",
  "system11": "Solid.",
  "user11": "Yeah. Solid.",
  "system12": "*End of conversation*",
  "user12": "Copy that.",
  "system13": "*Roger that.*",
  "user13": "Hooah.",
  "system14": "*Hooah.*",
  "user14": "Three weeks. Let\u2019s make it count.",
  "system15": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user15": "Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help me stop waking up screaming. I can't keep doing this to Amanda. Don't want to lose her. Don't want to lose what we built.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without waking up screaming\n2. Stop scaring Amanda\n3. Keep what you've built together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yeah. That's... that's about right. I just want to be normal again. Whatever the hell that means.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me\n3. I reclaim the steady man I used to be\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user17": "I sleep peacefully through the night. That\u2019s the one. If I can just... not wake up like that. Maybe everything else fixes itself.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep peacefully through the night\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user18": "Amanda feels safe beside me... that\u2019s good. Real good. She deserves that.",
  "system19": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: Amanda feels safe beside me\n\nWhat about the third - \"I reclaim the steady man I used to be\"?",
  "user19": "I don't know about that one. \"Reclaim\" sounds like I'm some broken thing that needs fixing. I'm not broken. Just... tired. Real tired."
