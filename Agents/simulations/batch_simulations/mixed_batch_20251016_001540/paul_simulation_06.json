  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts says I need to do this intention thing before I go down to Costa Rica. I've got three weeks. \n\nNightmares are getting worse. Amanda's barely sleeping in our bed anymore\u2014says I wake up shouting and she can't take it. If I don't fix this... I don't know. Maybe there won't be a marriage left to save.\n\nI don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff, but those guys at Heroic Hearts... they're veterans. They get it. Said this might be my last shot.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda feels safe in our bed again  \n3. Save what's left of my marriage\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those are... those are the things. \n\nI just want to sleep without waking up drenched in sweat, heart pounding like I'm back there. Want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of bomb that might go off. Want to be the man she married, not... whatever this is.\n\nHow do we make these into whatever you call them\u2014intentions? Without making them sound all soft and weak?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me again\n3. I reclaim the man Amanda married\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. Amanda feels safe beside me again. That's what matters most.\n\nBut I don't know... \"reclaim the man Amanda married\" sounds like I'm some kind of victim. I'm not broken, I just need to get this under control.\n\nHow about: \"I am the steady man my family trusts.\" That better. Stronger.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: **I am the steady man my family trusts**\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "\"I sleep peacefully through the night\" - that one's good. Direct. No fluff.\n\nBut that third one... \"Amanda feels safe beside me again\" - I don't like how that puts it all on her. Like I'm waiting for her to change or something. \n\nShould be about me showing up different. Something like... \"I create safety in my own home.\" Yeah. That's on me, not her.\n\nWhat do you think?",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: **I create safety in my own home**\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I am the steady man my family trusts\n3. I create safety in my own home\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I guess we'll see what happens in Costa Rica.",
  "system5": "Solid. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah. That's what worries me\u2014what might come. But I hear you. \n\nThree weeks. Then we'll see what's been hiding in there.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is good time. The work starts now - reading those intentions daily, letting them settle in.\n\nWhat comes up won't be stronger than what you're already carrying.",
  "user6": "I like that. \"What comes up won't be stronger than what you're already carrying.\"\n\nBeen carrying this for twelve years. Guess I can handle whatever the medicine shows me.",
  "system7": "Exactly. Twelve years proves you've got the strength.\n\nThe medicine just helps you stop carrying it alone.",
  "user7": "I never thought about it like that. Always figured I had to carry it myself\u2014part of the job description, you know?\n\nBut maybe... maybe there's another way.",
  "system8": "That's the shift. Twelve years of doing it solo - the medicine might show you how to set some of that weight down.\n\nKeep reading those intentions. You're ready.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I am. \n\nAppreciate this\u2014more than I can say.",
  "system9": "You already said enough. Trust what's ahead.",
  "user9": "Copy that. See you on the other side.",
  "system10": "Roger that.",
  "user10": "*smiles* Old habits die hard.",
