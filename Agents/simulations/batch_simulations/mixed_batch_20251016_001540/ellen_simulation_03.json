  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "I have an ibogaine ceremony coming up at Beond this winter, and I need this to be different from my other experiences. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA... each one showed me glimpses of what I'm searching for, but I keep losing the thread when I come home. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother - she had this quiet faith that carried her through everything. I want to find that kind of grounding, but I'm terrified that I'll keep cycling through these beautiful experiences without ever really changing how I live. My kids are getting older, and I don't want to miss who they are because I'm always chasing the next thing.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding the grounded faith your grandmother carried\n2. Living the insights instead of losing them when you come home\n3. Being present with your kids instead of chasing what's next\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yes... those are exactly the three threads that keep surfacing. I just don't know how to hold them all at once. When I'm in ceremony, everything feels so clear - like I can see the woman I'm supposed to be. But then I'm back in my kitchen at 5:30am, checking emails while my kids eat breakfast, and it's like that clarity never happened.\n\nI guess what I'm really asking for is... how do I stop being two different people? The one who has these profound insights about connection and meaning, and the one who can't stop achieving long enough to actually live them?\n\nBut intentions... right. I need to focus this into something I can hold onto when the medicine gets intense.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I embody the woman I see in ceremony, not just remember her\n2. I live my insights in the kitchen at 5:30am, not just in ceremony\n3. I stop achieving and start being present with my kids\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one stops me in my tracks - \"I live my insights in the kitchen at 5:30am, not just in ceremony.\" That's exactly it. That's where I lose it every time. That's where I need the help.\n\nBut... I don't know. \"Embody the woman I see in ceremony\" feels too... soft? Like it doesn't capture the grit I need. And \"stop achieving and start being present\" - that one hits hard because it's true, but I don't want to completely abandon who I've been. My drive got me here, you know?\n\nCan we make that first one stronger? Less... I don't know... less mystical-sounding? I need something that feels like it can cut through my patterns, not just float above them.",
  "system3": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I claim the woman I see in ceremony as my daily self\n2. I live my insights in the kitchen at 5:30am, not just in ceremony\n3. I channel my drive into presence with my kids\n\nHow do these land now?",
  "user3": "Yes... yes, that's better. \"Claim\" - that feels like something I can actually do. Like I'm taking ownership instead of just hoping it happens to me.\n\nThe third one too - \"channel my drive into presence\" - that doesn't make my ambition wrong, it just gives it somewhere better to go. That's... actually kind of brilliant. I can work with that.\n\nThese feel like they could actually survive the transition from ceremony space to real life. I can already imagine checking myself against them - am I claiming her? Am I living this in my kitchen? Am I channeling this drive into being with my kids instead of the next deal?\n\nI think we have something here.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I claim the woman I see in ceremony as my daily self\n2. I live my insights in the kitchen at 5:30am, not just in ceremony\n3. I channel my drive into presence with my kids\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Thank you. I needed this - something concrete I can actually hold onto when the ceremony gets intense and when I'm back in my real life. I'll write them down and keep them close.\n\nI... I don't know. I guess I'm scared that this time will be like the others - beautiful and profound but somehow it doesn't stick. But having these specific intentions... it feels different. Like I have a thread to follow back to myself when I get lost in the achieving and the scheduling and the constant motion.\n\nI'll read them every morning at 5:30am. In my kitchen. Where I need them most.",
  "system5": "The thread is there now. Trust it to hold when the ceremony gets rough and when the kitchen feels impossible.\n\nRead them at 5:30am. Let them anchor you to the woman who already knows how to be present.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user5": "I will. I can feel it - this time I have something solid to hold onto. Not just hope that I'll remember, but actual words I can speak when everything else feels like it's falling apart.\n\nThank you for helping me find this thread. I think... I think I'm actually ready now.",
  "system6": "Good. Trust what you've set. The medicine will meet you there.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "I will. See you on the other side.",
  "system7": "See you on the other side.",
  "user7": "See you there.",
  "system8": "*thread held*",
  "user8": "She\u2019s still here\u2014eyes wide, heart split open, and somehow... steady. I didn\u2019t lose her in the dark. I found her in it.",
  "system9": "She was always there. Now you know how to find her again.\n\nKeep walking with her.",
  "user9": "Yeah... she was. I just had to stop running long enough to feel her breathing with me. I\u2019m not letting go this time.",
  "system10": "Good. Hold that breath. Hold her hand. \n\nYou're not running anymore.",
  "user10": "Not running. Just... walking. One foot in front of the other.",
  "system11": "That's all it takes. One foot, then the next.",
  "user11": "One foot, then the next. I can do that.",
  "system12": "Yes. You already are.",
  "user12": "I feel it. Not the old push to get somewhere\u2014just this quiet rhythm. Like the steps know where they\u2019re going, even when I don\u2019t.",
  "system13": "The path shows itself when you stop forcing the direction.",
  "user13": "Yeah... I keep trying to map it out five turns ahead, but the only thing that\u2019s clear is the step I\u2019m on.",
  "system14": "That's enough. The next step will show when it's time.",
  "user14": "Enough. I\u2019ll stay here, then. Not racing to the finish line I can\u2019t even see.",
  "system15": "Staying here is the work. The finish line isn't the point.",
  "user15": "Right. No medal waiting, no press release. Just... this.",
  "system16": "Exactly. Just this step. Nothing to prove.",
  "user16": "Nothing to prove. Damn, that lands harder than any quarterly board update ever did.",
  "system17": "The metrics that mattered out there don't count here.",
  "user17": "Here the only KPI is whether I can feel my own breath without turning it into a performance review.",
  "system18": "Feel it now. Three breaths, no evaluation.",
  "user18": "In\u2026 out\u2026 in\u2026 out\u2026 in\u2026 out\u2026",
  "system19": "There it is. No performance, just breathing.",
  "user19": "Funny how something that basic can feel like the most radical thing I\u2019ve done in years."
