  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_6",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your work.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this ayahuasca stuff might help with... everything. My wife Amanda's about had it with me. I wake up screaming three, four nights a week and tell her it's nothing. But it's not nothing, is it?\n\nI can't lose her. I can't lose the kids. If this plant medicine thing can fix whatever's broken in me, then I'll do it. I just... I need to be able to sleep through the night again. Need to stop snapping at everyone. Need to be the man they think I am, not... whatever this is.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Stop snapping at Amanda and the kids\n3. Become the man they believe you are\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three things. That's it exactly.\n\nI just want to wake up without my heart pounding like I'm back in the cockpit. Want to stop scaring Amanda when I jerk awake shouting. And I need to be someone my kids can respect - not this angry ghost walking around my own house.\n\nHow do we... how do we turn those into whatever these intentions are supposed to be?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I create safety for Amanda instead of fear\n3. I show up as the father my kids can respect\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. \"I create safety for Amanda instead of fear.\" That's... that's what I need. She shouldn't have to walk on eggshells in her own house, wondering what'll set me off. She's been doing that for too long.\n\nBut this language... it's so soft. \"Create safety.\" I don't know. Seems weak. Like something from a self-help book.\n\nCan we make it stronger? More direct? Something about protecting her, not... whatever \"creating safety\" means.",
  "system3": "How about: \"I protect Amanda instead of frightening her\"?\n\nOr: \"I make home safe for Amanda again\"?\n\nWhich feels more like what you need to do?",
  "user3": "\"I protect Amanda instead of frightening her.\" That's better. That's what I'm supposed to do - protect her. Not jump awake thinking I'm under fire, grabbing at sheets like they're my flight controls. Not snapping when she asks if I'm okay.\n\nShe married me because she felt safe with me. Now she checks the locks twice when I'm having a bad night. That's not right. A man should protect his home, not be the thing his family needs protection from.\n\nLet's go with that one.",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I protect Amanda instead of frightening her\n\nHow do the other two land?\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n3. I show up as the father my kids can respect",
  "user4": "The first one... \"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" Sounds too easy. Like I just need better pillows or something. \n\nIt's not about peaceful sleep - it's about not waking up thinking I'm dying. Not seeing flames that aren't there. Not hearing explosions in the goddamn dishwasher. I need the war to stay in the past where it belongs, not follow me into my bedroom every night.\n\nAnd the third one... my kids already respect me. They just don't know me. Not really. They know Dad who goes to work, Dad who takes them to church, Dad who helps with homework. They don't know the guy who stares at the ceiling at 3 AM, counting ceiling tiles like I counted days left in deployment.\n\nI need to be present with them. Really there, not just physically in the room while I'm fighting battles in my head.",
  "system5": "Let's adjust:\n\n1. I leave the war in the past where it belongs\n3. I show up fully present when I'm with my kids\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user5": "Yeah. Those feel right. Real.\n\n\"I leave the war in the past where it belongs.\" That's what I need. I did my job over there, did what I had to do. But I'm home now. Been home for years. The missions are done, the birds are grounded, and I need to stop flying them in my sleep.\n\n\"I show up fully present when I'm with my kids.\" That's it. Not just sitting next to them on the couch while I'm back in some valley that doesn't exist anymore. Actually hearing about their day, helping with math homework without getting impatient, watching their games without my mind drifting to places they can't see.\n\nThese feel like something I can actually work toward. Not just wish for.",
  "system6": "Your 3 intentions:\n\n1. I leave the war in the past where it belongs\n2. I protect Amanda instead of frightening her\n3. I show up fully present when I'm with my kids\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass, not your destination. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Got it. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate this. Three weeks isn't much time to carry these around before the ceremony, but maybe that's enough.",
  "system7": "Three weeks is plenty. The medicine works with what you bring.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "Right. Trust what comes. That's the part that makes me nervous, but... I'm here, aren't I? Signed up for this thing. Put it in writing.\n\nI'll see what the plants have to say about these intentions of mine.",
  "system8": "Exactly. You showed up. That's what matters now.",
  "user8": "Yeah. I showed up. Not just here, but... really showed up. First time in a long while I haven't been running from one thing to another, keeping busy so I don't have to think about why Amanda flinches when I move too fast.\n\nI showed up. That's something.",
  "system9": "That's everything. The rest follows.",
  "user9": "Everything, huh? \n\nGuess we'll see about that.",
  "system10": "We will. You ready.",
  "user10": "Ready as I'll ever be.",
  "system11": "Good. That's all \"ready\" ever means.",
  "user11": "Fair enough. \n\nI'll take it one day at a time, keep these intentions close. Maybe... maybe that's how I get through this without losing what makes me useful.",
  "system12": "Keep the intentions close. Let the rest unfold.",
  "user12": "I\u2019ll keep them in my wallet with my pilot\u2019s license. Been carrying that thing for years\u2014seems right to keep these close too.",
  "system13": "That's your anchor. The intentions and the license\u2014both let you navigate.",
  "user13": "Yeah. Both got me through some rough air.",
  "system14": "Then you already know how to use them.",
  "user14": "Guess I do. Just never thought I'd need a different kind of map to get home.",
  "system15": "Sometimes the map you know gets you lost. New territory needs new coordinates.",
  "user15": "I hear you. Just gotta trust the instruments I can\u2019t see yet.",
  "system16": "Exactly. The ones that read what's real, not what feels familiar.",
  "user16": "That\u2019s the part that scares me. What if what\u2019s real is something I can\u2019t live with?",
  "system17": "Then you live with it anyway. The medicine doesn't show you more than you can carry\u2014it just shows you what's already on your back.",
  "user17": "Heavy enough already. But if it\u2019s all there\u2026 guess I need to see the weight.",
  "system18": "Seeing it\u2019s the first step to setting it down.",
  "user18": "Setting it down... feels like dropping my weapon in a hot zone.",
  "system19": "Carrying it everywhere is costing you more than the fight.",
  "user19": "Yeah. Costing me Amanda. Costing me the kids. Hell\u2014costing me myself."
