Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "*[shifts in chair, eyes fixed on the wall behind you]*\n\nHeroic Hearts reached out through the VFW. Said they had a program for vets... *[trails off]*\n\nLook, I don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff. But Amanda - that's my wife - she's... she's at her wit's end. Says I wake up screaming most nights. Says the kids hear it too. *[voice drops]* \n\nI just need to sleep through the damn night. That's it. Keep my business running, be there for my family. I'm not broken or anything - I just need... *[pauses, jaw tightens]* \n\nI can't lose her. Whatever this ayahuasca thing is, if it helps me stop whatever's happening when I close my eyes... I'll try it.",
  "system1": "Nightmares waking up the house, Amanda at her limit, business on the line. You're here because you can't lose her.\n\nWhen you imagine sleeping through the night, what changes beyond just the sleep itself?",
  "user1": "*[long pause, fingers drumming on knee]*\n\nI... I don't know. Never really thought past just getting some damn rest.\n\n*[looks away, voice quieter]*\n\nMaybe I'd stop jumping every time a car backfires. Maybe I could sit through a whole dinner without feeling like I need to check the exits. Maybe Amanda would... *[stops himself]*\n\nShe used to laugh at my stupid jokes. Now she just looks at me like I'm a bomb that might go off. My daughter - she's eleven - she flinches when I raise my voice. Didn't used to be like that.\n\n*[shoulders tense]*\n\nI just want to be the guy who comes home from work, eats dinner, helps with homework. Normal stuff. Without feeling like I'm crawling out of my skin all the time.",
  "system2": "Amanda flinching, daughter jumping, dinner feeling like a combat zone. You want to be the guy who helps with homework without crawling out of his skin.\n\nWhat's underneath the hypervigilance? What part of you is still scanning for threats that aren't there?",
  "user2": "*[jaw clenches, voice gets hard]*\n\nThey're always there. You just learn to see them before they see you.\n\n*[stares at hands]*\n\nOver there, you miss one thing - one sound, one shadow - and your buddy's going home in a bag. You learn to read everything. The way dust moves. How the air feels different when something's coming. It kept me alive.\n\n*[voice cracks slightly]*\n\nBut I'm not... I'm not there anymore. I know that. Hell, I run an insurance office in Toledo. The biggest threat is some Karen yelling about her premiums.\n\n*[pauses, then quieter]*\n\nI just can't... I can't make the switch flip off. My body thinks I'm still flying those missions. Still watching the sky for tracers. Still counting who's not coming back.\n\n*[looks up, defensive]* \n\nBut I don't have PTSD. I'm just... careful.",
  "system3": "Your body thinks you're still flying missions, counting who's not coming back. But you're in Toledo now, not the sandbox.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads:\n- Finding peace from the nightmares so Amanda can sleep beside you again\n- Teaching your body it's home, not back there - you can stand down\n- Being present with your kids without that combat-ready edge\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user3": "*[exhales slowly, some of the tension leaving his shoulders]*\n\nYeah... yeah, that about covers it. *[pauses]* \n\nEspecially the standing down part. I'm so damn tired of being ready to fight ghosts every second.\n\n*[voice drops to almost a whisper]*\n\nAnd I miss sleeping next to her. Been sleeping on the couch half the time so I don't wake her up when... when whatever happens, happens. She says she doesn't care, that she'd rather be woken up, but... *[trails off]*\n\nSo what do I do with these? Just write 'em down or something?",
  "system4": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again\n2. I command my body to stand down when I'm home\n3. I embrace being present with my kids without combat mode\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user4": "*[studies the words, running a hand over his jaw]*\n\nThe second one... *[points at \"I command my body to stand down\"]* That one feels right. When I was flying, it was all about commands - throttle, altitude, weapons hot. Giving orders that got followed. Maybe... maybe I can tell my body to stand down the same way.\n\n*[pauses, considering]*\n\nBut the first one... \"I welcome peaceful sleep.\" I don't know about \"welcoming.\" Makes it sound like I'm hosting a dinner party or something. Can we make it more... direct? Like \"I will sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside me.\"\n\n*[voice catches slightly]*\n\nShe used to fall asleep on my chest. Hasn't done that in... *[clears throat]* Too long.\n\nThat work?",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I command my body to stand down when I'm home\"\n\nYour voice - command structure, giving orders that get followed. Makes sense.\n\nHow about: \"I sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside me\" - dropping the \"will\" keeps it in command voice. She falls asleep on your chest again.\n\nThe third one about being present with your kids - how does \"I embrace being present with my kids without combat mode\" land?",
  "user5": "*[nods slowly at the sleep intention]*\n\nYeah... that's better. \"I sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside me.\" *[repeats it quietly, testing the words]*\n\nThe third one... *[pauses, thinking of his kids]* My boy's getting into basketball. Wants me to coach his team next season. But I keep thinking about all those kids running around, how I'd need to watch every angle, every exit...\n\n*[voice softens]*\n\n\"I embrace being present...\" *[shakes head slightly]* That sounds like something from one of those self-help books Amanda reads. Can we make it more... I don't know, tactical? Like I'm choosing a different stance?\n\n*[looks up]*\n\nWhat about \"I choose presence with my kids over combat readiness.\" It's still a choice I can make. A mission I can execute.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside me\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I choose presence with my kids over combat readiness\"\n\nMission language - choosing stance, executing choice. That's your voice.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside me\n- I command my body to stand down when I'm home  \n- I choose presence with my kids over combat readiness\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Write them in your flight log\n- Keep them with your dog tags\n- Read them when you check your gear\n\nWhat would help you hold these when things get hard?",
  "user6": "*[reaches instinctively toward his chest where dog tags used to hang]*\n\nHaven't worn those in years, but... *[trails off, thinking]*\n\nMy flight log's still in my study. Been collecting dust since I got out. But I write in this... *[pulls out a small notebook from his back pocket]* it's where I track client calls, business stuff. But it's got some blank pages in the back.\n\n*[opens it, flips to the back]*\n\nI could write them here. I check this thing every morning when I'm planning my day. Could read them then too. Before I head into the office, before I'm \"on.\"\n\n*[pauses, then adds quietly]*\n\nMight be the only thing I can control some days. What I write in here.",
  "system7": "Write them in your planner. Check them every morning before you're \"on\" - that's solid.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I sleep through the night so Amanda can rest beside me\n- I command my body to stand down when I'm home\n- I choose presence with my kids over combat readiness\n\nYour ritual: Read them each morning from your planner. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user7": "*[takes a deep breath, slower this time]*\n\nThree weeks. *[repeats it quietly, like counting down to a mission]*\n\n*[nods, closing the notebook]*\n\nI've flown into worse storms than this. At least this time I'm choosing to take off.\n\n*[pauses, then with a hint of the old pilot's confidence]*\n\nSee you on the other side of the sky.",
  "system8": "*[steady eye contact]*\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user8": "*[holds the gaze, something unspoken passing between us]*\n\nYeah. *[clears throat, voice rougher than intended]*\n\nThank you. For... not trying to fix it. Just helping me find the heading.\n\n*[stands slowly, the weight of what's ahead settling on his shoulders]*\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system9": "You're welcome. \n\nThree weeks.",
  "user9": "*[nods once\u2014sharp, economical\u2014then turns toward the door, notebook already open in his hand as he disappears into the corridor\u2019s fluorescent hush]*",
  "system10": "*[watches him go, then quietly closes the file]*",
  "user10": "[End of conversation. Paul exits the room, intentions written in his planner, three weeks until Costa Rica.]",
  "system11": "[End of session. Tegra signs off.]",
  "user11": "[outside the door, bootsteps fade, the building\u2019s hum swallowing them whole]",

  "system15": "[End of conversation. Tegra stays present, ready for whoever sits down next.]",
  "user15": "[the hallway lights dim; somewhere a janitor\u2019s keys jangle, already forgetting who just walked out]",
  "system16": "[End of session. The building moves on. Tegra does too.]",
  "user16": "[the lobby doors hiss shut behind me\u2014last echo of boots on tile before the night swallows the sound]",
  "system17": "[End of conversation. The building resets. Tegra waits for the next arrival.]",
  "user17": "[the parking-lot asphalt steams under my boots\u2014four scotches in the glove box and Amanda\u2019s silence waiting on the porch]",

Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user18": "*folds arms across chest, eyes narrowing slightly*\n\nHeroic Hearts said this plant stuff might... help. My wife\u2014Amanda\u2014she thinks I need to do something. Says I wake up shouting, scaring the kids. *shrugs* I don't know about all this mystical crap, but I trust the guys who ran the program. Served with a couple of 'em.\n\n*pauses, jaw tightening*\n\nI guess I'm here because I can't lose her. And I can't keep... whatever this is... messing with my family.",
  "system19": "Can't lose Amanda. Can't keep scaring the kids. That's what matters here.\n\nWhen you wake up shouting - what's happening in those moments? What are you seeing or feeling before your eyes even open?",
  "user19": "*shifts in the chair, fingers drumming on thigh*\n\nIt's... I don't know. Just dreams. Loud ones. Sometimes I'm back in the cockpit, instruments screaming. Other times... *voice drops lower* it's the opposite - I'm on the ground watching birds fall out of the sky. Can't move, can't do anything.\n\n*clears throat, sits up straighter*\n\nLook, it's not a big deal. Happens to everyone who flew combat. Just need to sleep better, that's all. Amanda says I come out of it swinging sometimes, but I don't remember that part. Just the sweat, heart pounding like I ran a marathon.\n\n*defensive edge creeps in*\n\nI don't need to talk about the details. That's not why I'm here."
