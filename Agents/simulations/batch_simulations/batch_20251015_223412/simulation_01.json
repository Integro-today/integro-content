  "system0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for Ibogaine, and I keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014how she held onto her faith through everything while I seem to have traded mine for a company I don't even own anymore. I need to figure out what I'm actually searching for before I go chasing another answer.",
  "user0": "I hear the weight of that contrast - your grandmother's unwavering faith against your own journey that led to something that slipped away. There's something powerful in recognizing you're not looking for another external answer, but for what you're truly seeking inside yourself.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your ibogaine journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. Ibogaine particularly can open deep existential territory, making clear intentions especially valuable.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your Beond experience:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through exploring what you're really searching for beneath the surface. Together we'll build intentions that help you reconnect with meaning and purpose.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about intention-setting with ibogaine specifically and examples from others first.\n\nWhich feels right to start with?",
  "system1": "Option A. I'm tired of collecting achievements like they're supposed to mean something when they don't. My grandmother used to say \"the eagle sees everything but forgets to look inward\"\u2014and that's exactly what I've been doing. I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for before I keep flying in circles.",
  "user1": "That eagle metaphor from your grandmother cuts right to it - always scanning the horizon but missing what's right there inside. There's wisdom in recognizing that pattern before your ibogaine journey.\n\nWhat do you think you're actually hoping to discover or understand about yourself through this experience? Beyond the achievements and the external chase, what feels like it's missing?",
  "system2": "I think... I think I'm hoping to find the thread that connects all these pieces of me that feel scattered. The entrepreneur who built something meaningful, the mother who wants to be present, the granddaughter who walked away from faith, the woman who keeps chasing spiritual experiences but can't seem to hold onto them. \n\nIt sounds dramatic when I say it out loud, but I feel like I'm living five different lives and none of them are fully mine. I want to understand what's underneath all that\u2014what I actually believe, not just what I've been taught to achieve.",
  "user2": "That image of living five different lives, none fully yours - that's powerful. And wanting to find the thread that weaves through all those versions of yourself makes complete sense. Especially before ibogaine, which can really show us how all our pieces connect.\n\nWhen you imagine finding that thread, what would it feel like in your body or your daily life if all those scattered pieces suddenly felt like they belonged to one whole person?",
  "system3": "You know that feeling when you're hiking and suddenly everything just... clicks? Your breathing matches your steps, the air feels perfect on your skin, and for a few minutes you're not thinking about what you should be doing or who you need to become? \n\nI imagine it would feel like that, but lasting. Like I could sit in a board meeting without mentally checking if I'm being impressive enough, or play with my kids without thinking about the emails piling up. Just... present. One person, whole, instead of constantly calculating which version of myself needs to show up right now.",
  "user3": "That hiking metaphor is perfect - when everything aligns naturally without the constant calculations. I can feel how exhausting it must be to always be managing which version of yourself shows up.\n\nSo underneath all this, it sounds like you're searching for that authentic core that's present across all situations - the you that exists when you're not performing or achieving or managing expectations. What do you think has kept you from accessing that wholeness in your daily life?",
  "system4": "I think... I've been addicted to the feedback loop. Success, recognition, the next milestone\u2014it all gives me something to measure myself against. When you're building companies, there's always a next round, a next metric, a next level. \n\nBut the deeper truth? I'm terrified that if I stop achieving, there won't be anything there. What if I'm just... empty? What if my kids don't admire me, what if my husband sees I'm not that impressive, what if all I am is what I can produce? It's like I've built this machine that everyone expects to keep running, and I'm scared to see what happens when it stops.",
  "user4": "That fear of emptiness - of discovering there's nothing there when the machine stops - that's the real thing underneath, isn't it? And ibogaine has this way of stripping away all those external measures so you're faced with what's actually there, beyond what you produce.\n\nBut here's what I'm hearing: you're not just scared of being empty, you're also exhausted from maintaining the machine. There's something in you that knows there's more to you than what you can achieve or produce.\n\nWhat would it mean to discover that your worth isn't tied to that feedback loop - that you might be inherently valuable even when you're not achieving?",
  "system5": "It would mean everything I've built my life on is wrong. That the thing that made me exceptional is actually what's keeping me from being... real. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother again\u2014she never built anything impressive by startup standards, but when she walked into a room, people felt something. They wanted to be near her. She just *was*. Maybe that's what I'm jealous of\u2014not her faith exactly, but how she could just exist and that was enough.",
  "user5": "Yes - that quality of just *being* that drew people to her. You're not just jealous of her faith, you're jealous of that grounded presence that didn't need to prove anything. \n\nAnd recognizing that what made you exceptional might be what's keeping you from being real - that's a painful but profound insight. It takes courage to face that before ibogaine, because the medicine might just show you exactly that truth.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding the authentic thread that connects all your scattered pieces into one whole person\n2. Releasing the addiction to achievement and external validation that's become your identity\n3. Discovering your inherent worth beyond what you can produce or achieve\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your Beond experience.",
  "system6": "Yes... that's exactly it. When you say it like that, it sounds so simple, but each one feels like it would require dismantling everything I've built. \n\nI need to sit with these for a moment. These aren't small shifts\u2014they're... everything. My whole identity.",
  "user6": "Take all the time you need to feel the weight of this. You're right - these aren't small tweaks, you're talking about rebuilding your entire relationship with yourself. That's the kind of deep work ibogaine can open up, and it's okay that it feels massive.\n\nWhen you're ready, we can craft intentions that honor both the courage of this dismantling and the possibility of what might emerge on the other side.",
  "system7": "I need to be honest - I'm scared. What if I go through all this and discover I'm not enough without the achievements? What if I can't find my way back to being someone my kids can look up to? \n\nBut... I also know I can't keep living like this. The constant proving, the exhaustion, the way I'm never really here even when I'm physically present. It's killing something in me.\n\nMaybe my intentions could be about being brave enough to see what's really there, even if it's not what I hope to find. And trusting that whatever I discover, I can figure out how to build something real from it.",
  "user7": "That honesty about your fear - while also knowing you can't keep living this way - that's the real courage. And yes, being brave enough to see what's really there, even if it's terrifying, might be exactly what you need to set as an intention.\n\nLet me reflect back what I'm hearing for your intentions:\n\n1. Being brave enough to see your authentic self beyond achievements, even if it's not what you hope to find\n2. Trusting that whatever you discover, you'll have the capacity to build something real and meaningful from it\n3. Finding that grounded presence - like your grandmother had - where you can just *be* without constantly proving\n\nHow do these feel? Do they capture what you want to carry into your journey?",
  "system8": "They feel... terrifying and necessary. Like standing at the edge of a cliff, knowing you have to jump but not knowing if there's water below or just rocks.\n\nBut yes. These are mine. I need to be brave enough to see what's really there, trust I can build from whatever I find, and stop performing long enough to discover what it feels like to just be. \n\nI'll carry these with me. Thank you for helping me find the words.",
  "user8": "Those are powerful intentions - standing at that cliff edge knowing you have to jump anyway. You've captured something essential here.\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them in a journal you can read before your ceremony\n- Record yourself reading them and listen during quiet moments\n- Create a small ritual space with objects that represent each one - maybe something from nature for authenticity, something that represents courage, something that reminds you of your grandmother's presence\n- Keep them on a card in your wallet\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when the fear gets loud?\n\nYour intentions for this journey:\n1. Be brave enough to see your authentic self beyond achievements\n2. Trust you can build something real from whatever you discover  \n3. Stop performing long enough to discover what it feels like to just be\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The ibogaine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you courage on this journey.",
  "system9": "I think... I want to write them in my journal, but not just as words. I'm going to find something from nature on one of my hikes with the kids this weekend\u2014maybe a feather or a smooth stone\u2014and keep it with me. Something that reminds me that authentic things exist in the world without trying.\n\nAnd I'll read these before the ceremony, when I'm scared out of my mind. Which I will be. But maybe that's okay too\u2014being scared and doing it anyway feels more honest than pretending I'm not terrified.\n\nThank you. For helping me find the words when I couldn't.",
  "user9": "Finding something from nature - that feels perfect. A feather or smooth stone that just exists without trying, like your grandmother did. And yes, being scared out of your mind and doing it anyway is exactly the kind of honest courage this work asks for.\n\nYour intentions are ready, and so are you - not because you're not scared, but because you're willing to be real about the fear and still move forward.\n\nWishing you courage on this journey. You've got this.",
  "system10": "Thank you. I don't know what I'll find on the other side, but I'm going to walk into this with open eyes. \n\nSee you on the other side of whatever this is.",
  "user10": "Yes - walking in with open eyes. That's all any of us can do.\n\nSee you on the other side. I'll be here when you're ready to talk about what you found.",
  "system11": "I'll be back. Whether I'm still Ellen-the-achiever or just... Ellen. \n\nThank you for walking me through this. Really.",
  "user11": "I'll be here too - whether you're still Ellen-the-achiever or discovering what it means to just be Ellen.\n\nThank you for trusting me with this work.",
  "system12": "I\u2019m scared, but I\u2019m ready to trust what comes next.",
  "user12": "That\u2019s all you need, really.  \nScared and willing is the perfect place to begin.",
  "system13": "Then I\u2019m there. Scared and willing. Let\u2019s do this.",
  "user13": "Then you\u2019re exactly where you need to be.\n\nGo gently. Trust the medicine. Trust yourself.\n\nI\u2019ll be here when you return.",
  "system14": "I\u2019m holding that. Gently. Trusting. See you soon.",
  "user14": "See you soon.",
  "system15": "See you soon.",
  "user15": "See you soon.",
  "system16": "See you soon.",
  "user16": "See you soon.",
  "system17": "See you soon.",
  "user17": "See you soon.",
  "system18": "See you soon.",
  "user18": "See you soon.",
  "system19": "See you soon.",
