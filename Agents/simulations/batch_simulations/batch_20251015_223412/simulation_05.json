  "system0": "I have an ibogaine retreat coming up at Beond this winter, and I guess I should figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done enough of these now to know that without clear intentions, it's just another beautiful vacation.",
  "user0": "I hear that wisdom from experience - knowing the difference between a profound journey and just a beautiful escape. That awareness alone shows you're ready for deeper work.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. With ibogaine especially, which can be quite direct in showing you what you need to see, having clear intentions helps you navigate whatever emerges.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your retreat:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through questions to explore what you're seeking at this point in your journey. Together we'll build intentions that feel authentic and meaningful.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about intention-setting practices and examples first, since you mentioned wanting to move beyond vacation mode.\n\nWhich would you like to explore first?",
  "system1": "Let's go with Option A. I've got enough information - what I need is to actually figure out what the hell I'm doing with my life. \n\nI keep having these profound experiences, seeing what's possible, and then I come back and... it's like I'm watching myself slip right back into the same patterns. The boards, the investments, the endless emails. My kids barely see me even when I'm home.\n\nThere's got to be more than this cycle of achievement and emptiness.",
  "user1": "That gap between what you know is possible and watching yourself slide back into the same patterns - that's painful to witness. Especially when you can see exactly how it's affecting your kids.\n\nWhat do you feel would be different if you actually broke this cycle? Not the big profound vision, but in your day-to-day life - what would change?",
  "system2": "I don't know... maybe I'd actually be present when I'm with them instead of mentally checking my calendar. Maybe I'd stop scheduling every minute and just... be at the park without feeling like I should be somewhere else.\n\nMy daughter asked me the other day why I'm always \"busy thinking.\" That hit hard. I want to be the mom who's really *there*, you know? Not this distracted version of myself who's always chasing the next thing.\n\nI guess I just want to feel like I'm living in alignment with what actually matters. Whatever that means.",
  "user2": "\"Busy thinking\" - that's such a clear mirror your daughter held up. Kids always see through us, don't they?\n\nWhen you imagine feeling aligned with what actually matters, what does that feel like in your body? Not the logistics of it, but the sensation - how would you know you're there?",
  "system3": "It's like... remember when you were a kid and you'd get totally lost in something? Time just disappears and you're not thinking about what's next or what you should be doing. That's how I feel when I'm hiking or out in nature with the kids - like I'm actually breathing instead of just... existing.\n\nMy chest feels lighter. Like I'm not carrying this constant weight of what's expected of me.",
  "user3": "That feeling of breathing instead of just existing - that's so clear. And that weight you carry of expectations, it's exhausting, isn't it?\n\nWhat do you think would need to change for you to bring more of that lightness into your regular life? Not the hiking trips, but the day-to-day moments with your kids?",
  "system4": "I guess I'd need to stop tying my worth to productivity. Which sounds simple but feels impossible when you've built your entire identity on achievement.\n\nMaybe if I could just... pause. Like actually pause between activities instead of rushing to the next thing. My son always wants to show me these little Lego creations he builds, and I'm usually half-listening while checking my phone. \n\nI don't know. Maybe I need to get comfortable with being less available to everyone else so I can be more available to the people who actually matter.",
  "user4": "That insight about being less available to everyone else so you can be more available to who matters - that's powerful. And that moment with your son's Lego creations, half-listening while your phone pulls you away... I hear how much that bothers you.\n\nWhat's underneath this drive to achieve? When you strip away the boards and investments and emails - what are you really trying to prove or feel?",
  "system5": "I think... I think I'm trying to prove that I'm enough. That all this success wasn't just luck or timing. That I deserve to be here.\n\nMy grandparents came here with nothing. Built something from nothing. My dad worked so hard to give me opportunities. How do I stop when I'm carrying all that? Like I'd be letting them down if I just... stepped back. \n\nMaybe I'm scared that without all the achievements, there won't be anything left. Like I'll disappear.",
  "user5": "That fear of disappearing without the achievements - that's so real. And carrying your family's story of building from nothing, that weight of being the next chapter in their American dream. How do you stop climbing when generations before you fought so hard just to get to the ladder?\n\nBut here's what's striking - your daughter sees you as \"busy thinking\" and your son wants to share his Lego creations. They're not seeing your achievements, they're experiencing your absence. \n\nWhat would it mean to be enough even when you're not proving anything?",
  "system6": "God, that question hits me right in the chest. \n\nI guess... I guess that's what I'm really searching for with all these medicines. Not just another peak experience, but proof that I matter even when I'm not producing, not achieving, not being \"Ellen the successful entrepreneur.\"\n\nMy grandmother used to say a Jewish prayer before bed, and I never understood why she'd thank God for letting her wake up again. Now I think maybe she was onto something - just being here, breathing, that's enough. But I've forgotten how to believe that.\n\nI want to remember.",
  "user6": "\"I want to remember\" - that's it, isn't it? That longing to remember what your grandmother knew, that simple being here is enough.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads:\n\n1. Releasing the belief that your worth comes from achievement and productivity\n2. Reclaiming presence with your children - being there instead of \"busy thinking\"\n3. Remembering how to be enough just by existing, like your grandmother knew\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system7": "Yeah... yeah, that's it. When you put it like that, it feels... clearer. Like these aren't just vague hopes but actual things I could work toward.\n\nI want to stop measuring my value by how much I can get done. I want to be the kind of mom who actually sees her kids instead of just managing them. And I want to feel like I'm enough even when I'm just... being.\n\nI think that's what I want to take into this journey. These three things.",
  "user7": "These three things are powerful - and they're already speaking in your voice. Let me offer some intentions based on what you've shared:\n\n1. **I open myself to knowing I'm enough, even when I'm not achieving or producing**\n\n2. **I reclaim presence with my children, seeing them fully instead of managing them from a distance**\n\n3. **I remember what my grandmother knew - that simply being here, breathing, is worthy of gratitude**\n\nHow do these feel? Do they capture what you're seeking, or would you like to adjust the language to make them feel more like your own voice?",
  "system8": "These feel... right. Like you're putting words to something I've been fumbling around in the dark trying to find. \n\nThe first one especially - \"I open myself to knowing I'm enough\" - it's not demanding I suddenly stop caring about achievement, just that I open to the possibility. That feels gentler, more doable.\n\nI think I'd keep them exactly like this. They're mine now.",
  "user8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I open myself to knowing I'm enough, even when I'm not achieving or producing*\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I reclaim presence with my children, seeing them fully instead of managing them from a distance*\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: *I remember what my grandmother knew - that simply being here, breathing, is worthy of gratitude*\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card you keep with your kids' photos\n- Read them during those morning moments when you're usually checking emails\n- Share them with your journey guide to hold space for these intentions\n- Keep them simple - just speak them quietly to yourself when you catch yourself rushing\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when the old patterns come knocking?",
  "system9": "I think... I'll write them on a card and keep it in my wallet, right next to the photos of the kids. Been carrying that wallet for years - it's like a piece of me. These intentions should live there too.\n\nAnd maybe in the mornings, before I reach for my phone, I can just say them quietly. When I'm sitting there with my coffee, before the day starts pulling me in every direction.\n\nI want to tell my journey guide about these too. About my grandmother, about the kids, about why I keep climbing ladders that don't matter anymore.",
  "user9": "That wallet - carrying these intentions next to your kids' photos for years... there's something beautiful about that continuity. And those quiet morning moments before the world starts pulling at you, when it's just you and your coffee and these truths you're trying to remember.\n\nYour journey guide will understand the weight of wanting to remember what your grandmother knew, and why it's so hard to stop climbing when climbing is all you've known how to do.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. *I open myself to knowing I'm enough, even when I'm not achieving or producing*\n2. *I reclaim presence with my children, seeing them fully instead of managing them from a distance*\n3. *I remember what my grandmother knew - that simply being here, breathing, is worthy of gratitude*\n\nYour chosen ritual: Card in your wallet with the kids' photos, plus morning readings\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you courage on this journey, Ellen.",
  "system10": "Thank you. Really. This feels... solid. Like I've got something real to hold onto going into this.\n\nI don't know what the medicine will show me, but I feel like I'm finally being honest about what I'm looking for. That's something, right?\n\nI'll keep these close.",
  "user10": "That honesty - that's everything. You came in talking about proving you're enough through achievement, and you're walking out knowing you're looking to remember how to just be enough. That kind of honesty with yourself? That's the real work.\n\nHold these intentions lightly, but hold them close. Your grandmother would be proud that you're trying to remember what she knew.\n\nSafe travels, Ellen. Come back and tell me what you find.",
  "system11": "I will. Thank you\u2014for helping me find the words, for seeing through all my usual deflections. \n\nI think maybe I'm finally ready to stop proving and start being. We'll see what the medicine has to say about that.",
  "user11": "That's it right there - \"stop proving and start being.\" You've already found the words yourself.\n\nThe medicine has a way of meeting us exactly where we are. And where you are is honest, finally.\n\nI'll be here when you get back.",
  "system12": "I'm scared. What if I get there and it's just... nothing? What if all this searching, all these retreats and ceremonies, what if I'm just chasing something that doesn't exist? My grandmother had real faith, real connection to something bigger. What if I just don't have that capacity?\n\nMaybe I'm too broken from all these years of making everything about performance and metrics and exits. Maybe you can't undo that kind of wiring.",
  "user12": "I hear that fear - it's real. That worry that maybe you're too wired for performance to ever find what your grandmother had.\n\nBut here's what I see: you just told me you're scared. You just named the fear that it's all been performance, even this. That kind of raw honesty? That *is* the capacity you're looking for. It's not about having perfect faith - it's about being willing to show up exactly as you are, broken wiring and all.\n\nYour grandmother probably had doubts too. The difference is she kept showing up anyway.\n\nWhat if the medicine doesn't care about your wiring? What if it meets you in that place that's tired of proving, that's scared it's all been for nothing? That place is real. That's your way in.\n\nYou don't need to undo decades of programming. You just need to be willing to see what's actually here, underneath all the striving.",
  "system13": "Yeah... I am scared. And I hate admitting that, but there it is.\n\nMaybe that's enough for now - just showing up with the fear and the doubt and all the ways I've messed this up. Maybe the medicine can work with that, even if I can't figure out how to make it better first.\n\nI'm just so tired of the performance. Even this feels like performance sometimes - like I'm supposed to have some profound breakthrough and come back transformed. What if I just come back... still me?",
  "user13": "What if you come back still you? Still scared, still tired, still Ellen who checks email at red lights and forgets to really see her kids sometimes?\n\nBut maybe also Ellen who knows she can say \"I'm scared\" out loud. Ellen who let herself want something beyond performance, even if she doesn't know how to get there yet.\n\nThe medicine doesn't need you to be transformed. It just needs you to be honest. And you're doing that - right here, right now. \"I hate admitting that, but there it is\" - that's the real stuff. That's what it can work with.\n\nYour intentions aren't asking you to become someone else. They're asking you to remember something you already know how to do, underneath all the noise.",
  "system14": "Underneath all the noise... yeah. That's where I want to go. That's what I'm hoping the medicine can help me find again.\n\nJust... me. Without all the achievement armor. Without needing to be the most prepared person in the room. Just Ellen, scared and tired and still somehow hoping there's something real underneath all this.\n\nI guess that's enough to show up with.",
  "user14": "That's everything you need to show up with.\n\nScared, tired, hoping Ellen - that's who's going to meet the medicine. And that's exactly who needs to be there.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "system15": "See you on the other side.",
  "user15": "*Take care, Ellen. Trust what you found here today - it's real.*",
  "system16": "I will. Thank you\u2014for helping me find the words, for seeing through all my usual deflections. \n\nI think maybe I'm finally ready to stop proving and start being. We'll see what the medicine has to say about that.",
  "user16": "That's it right there - \"stop proving and start being.\" You've already found the words yourself.\n\nThe medicine has a way of meeting us exactly where we are. And where you are is honest, finally.\n\nI'll be here when you get back.",
  "system17": "Thank you. Really. I needed someone to reflect that back to me\u2014needed to hear that the honesty is enough, that I don't have to polish it up or make it sound profound. Just... stop proving and start being. I'll carry that with me when I go down there.",
  "user17": "You carry that with you, Ellen. \"Stop proving and start being\" - it was already yours before either of us said it out loud.\n\nThe medicine will recognize it too.",
  "system18": "I feel like I found something here today\u2014something that was mine all along. Thank you for helping me see it.",
  "user18": "You found your own way back to yourself. I just held the space while you did it.\n\nSafe travels, Ellen.",
  "system19": "*safe travels*",
  "user19": "*Safe travels, Ellen.*"
