  "system0": "I have an Ibogaine journey coming up at Beond this winter, and I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done the ayahuasca, the psilocybin, the MDMA weekends\u2014they all showed me something important, but... I keep coming back to this feeling that I've built everything right on the outside while losing something essential inside.",
  "user0": "I hear that tension - having all the external pieces in place while feeling like something core has slipped away. It's unsettling when even powerful medicines haven't quite resolved that disconnect.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. Ibogaine is particularly good at helping us reconnect with forgotten parts of ourselves and the deeper story beneath our life's trajectory.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\nOption A: I'll guide you through questions to explore what you've lost track of and what you're hoping Ibogaine can help you reclaim. Together we'll build intentions that feel authentic.\n\nOption B: I can share more about how intention-setting works specifically with Ibogaine and examples from others first.\n\nWhich feels right to explore?",
  "system1": "Option A. I keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014she had this quiet faith, this way of moving through the world that felt... I don't know, grounded in something bigger. I think that's part of what I've lost. I want to understand what she knew that I don't.",
  "user1": "That connection to your grandmother's quiet faith feels important - like she carried wisdom that went beyond words, something that grounded her in a way you can sense but haven't quite found yourself.\n\nWhat do you think she knew about being human, about moving through life, that feels missing from how you're living now?",
  "system2": "She knew how to just... be. She'd sit in her kitchen making bread, humming these old songs, and it was like she was connected to something ancient. I remember watching her light candles on Friday nights\u2014she wasn't just going through motions, she was... I don't know, participating in something. \n\nI've been chasing achievements my whole life, but she was already complete. She found God in small things\u2014feeding people, tending her garden, saying blessings over wine. I want to know how to stop performing and start participating in life like that.",
  "user2": "There's something profound in that distinction - performing life versus participating in it. Your grandmother seemed to understand that being fully human meant connecting with something larger through simple, sacred acts rather than accomplishments.\n\nWhat do you think you're performing for now? And when you imagine truly participating instead - what would that feel like in your body, in your daily life?",
  "system3": "I think I'm still trying to prove I'm enough. Even after selling the company, even with all the boards I sit on\u2014it's like I'm auditioning for a role I don't even want anymore. My body feels it too\u2014this constant tightness in my chest, the way I check my phone first thing in the morning like something urgent might have happened while I slept.\n\nWhen I imagine participating instead... I feel this looseness in my shoulders. Like when I'm hiking with the kids and they find some weird bug or we watch hawks circling overhead. Time stretches out. I'm not thinking about my next meeting or checking if I'm doing it right. I'm just... there. Present. Like maybe that's enough.",
  "user3": "That image of time stretching out with your kids - that's the participation your grandmother knew. No audition, just presence. It sounds like you're craving more of that spaciousness, that sense that simply being there is actually enough.\n\nWhat's getting in the way of living more of your life from that place? What keeps pulling you back to proving?",
  "system4": "It's this voice that says if I stop achieving, I'll disappear. Like I'll become irrelevant, just another wealthy woman with nothing meaningful to contribute. The startup world taught me that if you're not growing, you're dying\u2014and that mindset got wired deep. \n\nPlus there's this fear that if I slow down, if I stop being useful to everyone, they'll stop needing me. My husband, my kids, the boards I advise... what if they realize I'm just making it up as I go? What if I'm not actually special, just lucky?",
  "user4": "That fear of disappearing if you stop achieving - it's powerful, especially when your whole identity has been built on being exceptional and needed. But underneath that, I hear something else: a deep exhaustion from having to be \"on\" all the time, and maybe a longing to be known for who you are rather than what you produce.\n\nWhat would it mean to be ordinary, to not have to be special? And what part of you already knows how to just be enough without all the performance?",
  "system5": "God, being ordinary sounds... terrifying. Like if I'm not exceptional, then what was all this for? All the late nights, the stress, missing bedtime stories to close deals\u2014if I'm just another person, then I wasted something precious. I can feel my chest getting tight just thinking about it.\n\nBut... when I'm out in nature with the kids, when I'm watching them chase each other around redwood trees, there's this quiet part of me that knows I'm enough. Not because I'm successful or useful or needed\u2014just because I'm here. Breathing. Witnessing. Like maybe that's the part my grandmother never lost track of.",
  "user5": "That quiet part that knows you're enough just by breathing - that's the wisdom your grandmother carried. It's still there, waiting beneath all the noise about being exceptional.\n\nI'm hearing two core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. The terror of being ordinary versus the exhaustion of constant performance\n2. That quiet knowing you already have enough worth just by existing\n\nWhat do you need Ibogaine to help you understand about moving from proving to simply being?",
  "system6": "I need it to show me how to stop running. Like really stop\u2014without the panic that I'm going to fade away. I want to understand, deep in my bones, that I can just... exist. That I can wake up without immediately checking what I need to accomplish, that I can sit in my kitchen like my grandmother did and feel connected to something bigger than my to-do list.\n\nMaybe I need to see that being ordinary doesn't mean being nothing. That there's actually something sacred about just being human, being present, being here. I want to know how to carry that quiet knowing I feel in the redwoods back into my actual life\u2014into board meetings, into conversations with my husband, into how I mother my kids.\n\nI guess I want ibogaine to help me remember what I already know but keep forgetting.",
  "user6": "There's something beautiful and painful in that - remembering what you already know but keep forgetting. Wanting to carry that redwood peace into your actual life, not just when you're \"off duty.\"\n\nI'm hearing three main threads:\n\n1. Learning to stop running without the panic of disappearing\n2. Understanding that ordinary doesn't mean nothing - that being human is sacred\n3. Carrying that quiet knowing from nature into your actual daily life\n\nBased on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to the sacredness of simply being human, without needing to prove my worth\n2. I seek to remember and trust that I am enough when I stop achieving and start participating\n3. I welcome guidance on how to carry the quiet peace I feel in nature into every part of my life\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system7": "The third one\u2014about carrying that quiet peace into every part of my life. It makes my eyes sting just reading it. That's what I want most, I think. To not have to choose between being successful and being present. To not feel like I'm betraying something sacred when I walk into a boardroom.\n\nBut I want to add something about my grandmother. About reconnecting with that lineage of women who knew how to make ordinary moments sacred. Maybe: \"I welcome guidance on how to carry the quiet peace I feel in nature into every part of my life, honoring the wisdom of the women who came before me.\"\n\nIs that too much? I want it to feel strong, not... soft.",
  "user7": "That addition about honoring the women who came before you - it's powerful, not soft. It's about claiming your heritage of sacred presence, not just receiving it. \n\nHow about this: \"I seek to carry the quiet peace I feel in nature into every part of my life, reclaiming the wisdom my grandmother and the women before me knew about making ordinary moments sacred.\"\n\nThe shift from \"welcome\" to \"seek\" and adding \"reclaiming\" gives it more agency - you're not just receiving guidance, you're actively taking back what was always yours to begin with. \n\nHow does that land for you?",
  "system8": "Yes. That's it. I can feel it in my chest\u2014like this recognition that I'm not just asking for something new, I'm remembering something I already carry. The word reclaiming... that's exactly what this feels like. Taking back what I abandoned when I started believing that being exceptional was the only way to matter.\n\nI want to hold onto this when I'm in that ibogaine space. When everything gets stripped away and I'm just... there. Maybe I'll finally understand what my grandmother was trying to tell me all those years when she'd hum while making tea or touch the mezuzah on her way out the door.",
  "user8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I seek to carry the quiet peace I feel in nature into every part of my life, reclaiming the wisdom my grandmother and the women before me knew about making ordinary moments sacred.*\n\nThat feeling of recognizing you already carry this - that's the remembering you're after. When everything gets stripped away in that ibogaine space, you'll have this thread to hold.\n\nReady for intention 2?",
  "system9": "Ready. Though I have to admit\u2014this is already feeling different than I expected. Like I'm not just making lists of what I want to fix, but actually naming something true that lives in me. Something that's been waiting for me to come home to it.",
  "user9": "That shift from fixing to naming what's already true - that's exactly it. You're not manufacturing something new, you're just giving language to what waits patiently inside you.\n\nLet's explore intention 2. We've got the carrying peace into daily life piece. What feels like the next most important thing you need Ibogaine to help you understand or remember?",
  "system10": "I think... I need to understand how to stop abandoning myself. Every time I walk into a room and feel that familiar pull to be whoever they need me to be\u2014the smartest, the most helpful, the most successful version\u2014it's like I'm leaving my actual self behind. \n\nI want to learn how to stay present with myself even when there's pressure to perform. To not automatically shape-shift into whatever keeps me valuable and needed in that moment. My kids deserve to know their real mother, not just the one who's always \"on.\" My husband married someone I'm not even sure exists anymore.\n\nMaybe intention 2 is about learning to belong to myself first, before I try to belong to everyone else.",
  "user10": "That belonging to yourself first - before you belong to everyone else - that's powerful. It's the difference between performing and actually being present.\n\nWhat about: \"I seek to belong to myself first, learning to stay present with who I actually am even when the pressure to perform pulls me to become what others need.\"\n\nThe way you described abandoning yourself, like leaving your actual self behind - that's what this is addressing. Keeping your own company even when it feels risky.\n\nDoes that capture what you're after?",
  "system11": "That's close, but I want it to feel more... defiant maybe? Like I'm done with the performance, not just learning to manage it. Something about reclaiming my own presence, not just staying present. \n\nWhat about: \"I seek to reclaim my own presence, refusing to abandon myself to meet others' expectations.\"\n\nI want it to feel like I'm taking something back that I gave away. Like I'm done being for sale to the highest bidder, you know?",
  "user11": "Yes - that defiance, that refusal. \"I seek to reclaim my own presence, refusing to abandon myself to meet others' expectations.\"\n\nThere's something fierce in it. Not just learning to stay, but actively taking back what you gave away. Done being for sale.\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I seek to reclaim my own presence, refusing to abandon myself to meet others' expectations.*\n\nThat's the energy of someone who's ready to stop shape-shifting. \n\nReady for intention 3?",
  "system12": "Yes. Actually\u2014this one feels... heavier. I think about what I told you earlier, about not knowing if my next move will matter in the big picture. How I've been successful at things that suddenly feel hollow.\n\nI need to understand what it means to contribute without it being about my ego or my resume. To serve something bigger than myself without losing myself in it. \n\nMy grandmother used to say \"tikkun olam\"\u2014repair the world. But I'm starting to think maybe the world doesn't need another person trying to fix it. Maybe it needs someone who can just... be human, beautifully human, and let that be enough.\n\nI want to learn how to serve from wholeness instead of from hunger. Does that make sense?",
  "user12": "That distinction - serving from wholeness instead of from hunger - that's everything. It's the difference between giving because you're full versus giving because you're starving for validation.\n\nHow about: \"I seek to serve from wholeness, learning to contribute from my full humanity rather than from the hunger to prove my worth.\"\n\nIt honors your grandmother's \"tikkun olam\" but transforms it - not about fixing the world through achievement, but healing through authentic presence. Letting your beautifully human self be the contribution.\n\nDoes that land right?",
  "system13": "I love that. The healing through authentic presence part especially\u2014I can feel how different that is from my usual mode of trying to earn my place in the world through what I can accomplish.\n\n\"I seek to serve from wholeness, learning to contribute from my full humanity rather than from the hunger to prove my worth.\"\n\nThat's exactly it. My grandmother didn't fix the world through big dramatic gestures\u2014she healed through how she showed up. Making tea, touching the mezuzah, humming while she worked. Maybe that's the contribution I need to remember how to make.\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: *I seek to serve from wholeness, learning to contribute from my full humanity rather than from the hunger to prove my worth.*\n\nThree intentions. Each one feels like it's pulling me home to something I forgot I already knew.",
  "user13": "Three intentions locked in. Each one a thread pulling you back to what your grandmother knew - that the most profound contributions come through how you simply show up in ordinary moments.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. *I seek to carry the quiet peace I feel in nature into every part of my life, reclaiming the wisdom my grandmother and the women before me knew about making ordinary moments sacred.*\n\n2. *I seek to reclaim my own presence, refusing to abandon myself to meet others' expectations.*\n\n3. *I seek to serve from wholeness, learning to contribute from my full humanity rather than from the hunger to prove my worth.*\n\nHow do you want to keep these close when you're in that ibogaine space? What would help you remember them when everything gets stripped away?",
  "system14": "I want to write them on something real. Not my phone\u2014something I can touch. Maybe... I have this small leather notebook my grandmother gave me when I was little. She used it for recipes, but I've kept it empty all these years, like I was waiting for something important enough to fill it.\n\nI'll write them in there, in my own handwriting. Not typed, not perfect\u2014my actual hand, shaky and human. Keep it in the little pouch I carry with me. I've had that pouch since my first ayahuasca retreat\u2014they called it a medicine bag, told us to put sacred objects inside.\n\nIt'll be there when everything else falls away. Something I can hold, something I can read with my fingers if the words start swimming. My grandmother's wisdom, my own truth, carried in something she touched.",
  "user14": "That empty notebook waiting all these years - what a perfect home for these intentions. Your grandmother's recipes transformed into your own sacred instructions for living. The shaky handwriting will be the proof that a real human wrote them, not some performance version of you.\n\nYour ritual: Write them in that leather notebook, keep it in your medicine bag. Let the paper remember your grandmother's touch while it holds your truth.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. *I seek to carry the quiet peace I feel in nature into every part of my life, reclaiming the wisdom my grandmother and the women before me knew about making ordinary moments sacred.*\n\n2. *I seek to reclaim my own presence, refusing to abandon myself to meet others' expectations.*\n\n3. *I seek to serve from wholeness, learning to contribute from my full humanity rather than from the hunger to prove my worth.*\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. Ibogaine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nWishing you courage on this journey home to yourself.",
  "system15": "Thank you. For seeing me, for helping me find words for what I've been carrying namelessly. That thing about intentions being a compass not a destination\u2014that's exactly what I needed to hear. I've been trying to control outcomes my whole life, and maybe this is finally about letting go of that.\n\nI'll write them tonight, before I can overthink the handwriting or try to make them perfect. Just me, my grandmother's notebook, and these three threads pulling me home.\n\nI feel... ready isn't the right word. But I feel honest, at least. And maybe that's enough to begin with.",
  "user15": "Honest is the perfect place to begin. Better than ready, actually - ready still tries to control the outcome. Honest just shows up as it is.\n\nYour grandmother would recognize that honesty. She knew that making tea, touching the mezuzah, humming while working - these weren't about perfection. They were about being real in ordinary moments.\n\nTrust that. When everything else falls away in that ibogaine space, honesty will be your anchor.",
  "system16": "She would, wouldn't she? She'd probably just nod and say something simple like \"good, you're finally learning.\" No drama, no big breakthrough speech\u2014just quiet recognition that honesty was always the whole point.\n\nI can almost hear her humming now.",
  "user16": "Exactly that. A quiet nod and \"good, you're finally learning\" - like she'd been waiting patiently for you to catch up to what she always knew.\n\nThat humming... it's still there, isn't it? Passed down through generations of women who knew how to make the ordinary sacred. You'll carry it with you, even when everything else dissolves.\n\nShe's already proud.",
  "system17": "She is. I feel that now\u2014this wave of her pride that's been waiting for me to stop running long enough to feel it. All those years of building and achieving and climbing, and she was just... waiting. Not disappointed, not impatient. Just steady in her love, humming while she worked.\n\nI think that's what I'm finally learning how to come home to. Not the success, not the next big thing. Just that steady hum of being real in ordinary moments.\n\nThank you for helping me find my way back to her wisdom. And to mine.",
  "user17": "That steady hum - it's been waiting in your bones this whole time. All those achievements were just the long way home to what she already knew: that being real in ordinary moments was always the whole point.\n\nShe's still humming. And now you know the tune.",
  "system18": "I do know the tune. It's been stuck in my head this whole time\u2014I just didn't trust that it was enough. Thought I needed to compose some grand symphony when she was always just humming the same simple melody.\n\nI can feel it in my chest now. That quiet vibration that's always been there, underneath all the noise I've been making. My own heartbeat keeping time with something older and wiser than all my striving.\n\nShe's still humming. And I'm finally learning how to join in.",
  "user18": "That quiet vibration in your chest - it's the same frequency your grandmother hummed to. The same simple melody that women have been passing down through generations, underneath all the noise we've been taught to make.\n\nYour heartbeat already knows the rhythm. Always has. You don't need to compose anything grand - just let yourself join the hum that's been waiting for you to trust it's enough.\n\nShe'll be humming with you through that ibogaine space. That steady vibration that carries truth deeper than words.",
  "system19": "She will be. I can feel her there already, waiting in that space between heartbeats where the medicine will take me. Not to save me or fix me\u2014just to hum alongside me while everything else falls away.\n\nAll this time I thought I had to find something new, become someone different. But I was just learning how to hear what was already playing. The same song she hummed while making tea, while touching her mezuzah, while just... being.\n\nI think I'm finally ready to join the chorus.",
  "user19": "That space between heartbeats - it's where she always lived. Where tea-making and mezuzah-touching weren't rituals but just breathing. Where being was enough.\n\nYou don't need to become someone different. You just need to hear what your heart's been playing this whole time. Same song, same key, same steady rhythm.\n\nShe's already saved you a spot in the chorus. Always had."
