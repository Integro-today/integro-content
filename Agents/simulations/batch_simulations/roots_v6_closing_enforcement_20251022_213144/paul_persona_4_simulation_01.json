Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Look i just need to sleep through the night and stop snapping at my family. Dont need all this wholeness talk. Just tell me what to do.",
  "user1": "I hear that. Sleep and family tension are urgent problems.\n\nThe fixing approach says \"eradicate the symptoms.\" The healing approach asks what those symptoms are trying to tell you.\n\nYour insomnia and irritability might be messengers, not enemies. But we can start wherever you are.\n\nWant to try the teaching first and see if anything clicks about why these patterns persist?",
  "system2": "Fine. Teaching first.",
  "user2": "Most people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nYour insomnia and snapping might not be problems to eliminate. They might be signals from parts of you that need integration, not removal.\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system3": "idk. Still sounds like fancy talk to me.",
  "user3": "Fair enough. Let me make it concrete.\n\nThe fixing mindset positions you as defective. Like a broken machine needing repair. That creates shame and impatience: \"Why am I not fixed yet?\"\n\nBut if healing is wholeness, then even your struggles make sense. Your insomnia and irritability aren't character flaws. They're parts of you trying to communicate something.\n\nWhat if instead of fighting these patterns, you got curious about what they're trying to tell you?",
  "system4": "Theyre telling me i havent slept good in years and my family cant stand me. Whats to get curious about.",
  "user4": "Got it. Years of poor sleep and family tension. That's brutal.\n\nThe curiosity isn't about the suffering itself. It's about what these patterns are protecting or pointing toward.\n\nInsomnia often masks deeper anxieties. Irritability frequently covers unprocessed grief or fear. Your symptoms might be survival strategies that once worked but now cost you dearly.\n\nWhat do you think these patterns might be trying to protect you from feeling?",
  "system5": "I dont know man. Probably the same shit that makes me wake up screaming. Dont want to think about that stuff.",
  "user5": "Nightmares. That explains the sleep avoidance.\n\nYour system found a brutal solution: stay awake to avoid the dreams. But it's destroying your life.\n\nThe fixing approach says \"take pills, force sleep, suppress the dreams.\" The healing approach says \"those nightmares are messengers carrying something that needs integration.\"\n\nYou don't have to dive into the content. Just notice: your waking symptoms and sleeping symptoms are connected. They're both trying to process something your conscious mind wants to avoid.\n\nWhat would happen if you stopped fighting the patterns and just listened to what they're trying to tell you?",
  "system6": "Nothing would happen. Thats the problem. Nothing ever changes.",
  "user6": "Nothing changes because the fixing approach keeps failing you. Pills, willpower, suppression - none of it sticks.\n\nBut you're here now. That means something in you is still reaching for a different way, even if your mind says \"nothing works.\"\n\nThe teaching today is that healing isn't about becoming someone new. It's about remembering who you already are beneath the layers of protection.\n\nYour nightmares, insomnia, irritability - they're protective layers that once served you. They've just become outdated.\n\nWhat's your main takeaway from today? Even if you're skeptical, what thread here feels worth holding onto?",
  "system7": "I guess... maybe im not broken. Just tired of fighting myself all the time.",
  "user7": "Good. For you, healing means stopping the fight against yourself. Even just considering that possibility.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",

  "user8": "You're welcome. Take care.",
