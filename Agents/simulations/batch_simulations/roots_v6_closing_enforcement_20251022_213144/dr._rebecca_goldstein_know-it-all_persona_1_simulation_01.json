  "system0": "Alright, let's see what today's lesson is... though I should probably mention I've already read most of the psilocybin preparation protocols from Johns Hopkins, so I'm curious if there's anything in here I haven't encountered yet.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Actually, I'm familiar with this distinction\u2014the whole curing versus healing framework. It's central to integrative medicine and trauma therapy, particularly in somatic approaches. From a nervous system perspective, we\u2019re talking about shifting from sympathetic activation into more ventral vagal states where integration can actually happen.\n\nBut I\u2019m curious about Option A, the reflection path. I mean, I can cite the research on wholeness and integration, but clearly knowing the theory hasn\u2019t changed the fact that I\u2019m personally stuck. So maybe starting with the questions would be... I don\u2019t know, more honest? Let\u2019s try that.",
  "user1": "Good. Let's start with the questions then.\n\nFirst one: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Honestly, the first image that pops up is this ridiculous spreadsheet I made\u2014columns for symptoms, interventions, outcomes, success metrics. It's embarrassing, but healing has always been... I don't know, a problem to solve? Something broken that needs fixing, preferably with evidence-based protocols and measurable results. \n\nBut I also picture this other thing\u2014less clinical, more... I guess it's from this client I had who did an ayahuasca ceremony and finally let herself grieve her mother's death. She described feeling \"reassembled\" afterward. Not fixed, just... whole again. And I remember thinking, what would that even feel like? To not be constantly monitoring myself for what's wrong that needs correcting?\n\nSorry, I'm analyzing my own answer instead of just giving it. Classic Rebecca move.",
  "user2": "Got it. The spreadsheet versus the client who felt reassembled.\n\nTwo different healing paradigms living in you - fixing versus wholeness. Both real.\n\nWhat happens if you stay with that tension instead of picking one?",
  "system3": "I mean, I *know* you're right\u2014holding paradox is supposed to be the mature psychological move. But my nervous system literally doesn't know how. When I try to sit with both paradigms, I feel this... I don't know, almost physical pulling apart? Like my shoulders get tense and my mind starts racing between \"fix the broken parts\" and \"accept what is\" and I can't find the middle ground.\n\nActually, Linda asked me something similar last month\u2014what if the tension *is* the healing? Not resolving it, but learning to live in the questions. I intellectually understood what she meant, but when I tried to practice it, I ended up researching dialectics for three hours instead of just... being dialectical.\n\nI'm noticing I'm describing the tension instead of feeling it. There's probably some profound metaphor about my entire life in that.",
  "user3": "I hear that. Your body literally doesn't know how to hold both.\n\nInstead of trying to resolve it, what if you just notice where that pulling apart happens? Where do you feel it in your body right now?",
  "system4": "It's... God, this is uncomfortable. There's this tight band across my chest\u2014like someone's wrapped a resistance band around my ribcage and is slowly pulling it tighter. And my shoulders are definitely up by my ears, which I know is my \"therapist doing it wrong\" posture. \n\nBut there's something else too\u2014this fluttery, almost nauseous feeling right under my sternum. Like if I actually let myself feel both paradigms simultaneously, something might... I don't know, crack open? Which sounds melodramatic, but there it is.\n\nActually, I'm aware I'm analyzing my body sensations instead of just experiencing them. Classic isolation of affect\u2014describe the feeling, don't feel the feeling. My jaw is clenched too. I hadn't noticed that until I started describing not noticing things.",
  "user4": "Good. You're tracking the tension in real time.\n\nLet's move to question two: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system5": "Where *hasn't* it been helpful? My entire family\u2014mother's a psychiatrist, father's a philosophy professor\u2014practically worshipped at the altar of \"identify problems, apply solutions.\" Growing up, every feeling got analyzed into submission. My grandmother survived the Holocaust by being hypervigilant about threats, hyperfocused on solutions. \"They can take everything but what's in your head\"\u2014I inherited that along with her cheekbones.\n\nIn grad school, it was perfect\u2014learn the manualized treatments, apply them systematically, measure outcomes. I'm genuinely excellent at helping clients \"fix\" their panic attacks, their trauma responses. The research shows my approach works\u2014evidence-based practice is literally my brand.\n\nBut personally? I know exactly why I intellectualize everything, can trace it to attachment patterns, have processed it in IFS, EMDR, somatic work... and here I am, still unable to feel my feelings without immediately turning them into case formulations. I've been treating my own healing like a dissertation defense for 27 years\u2014always another protocol to try, another training to attend, another insight to achieve. Meanwhile, I'm lonelier than ever, and the psilocybin retreat is six weeks away and I'm making *spreadsheets* for it like it's a research study.\n\nThe fixing paradigm helped me become a competent therapist. It's kept me from becoming a whole person.",
  "user5": "That lands heavy. Competent therapist, lonely person.\n\nYou've mastered the fixing game but it's eating you alive from the inside. The psilocybin retreat becomes another research study to optimize.\n\nQuestion three: What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system6": "Honestly? I don't think I know anymore. When I try to picture wholeness, I get this... nothing. Just blank. Like I've been living in my head for so long that wholeness feels like a concept other people access, not me.\n\nBut if I'm being really honest\u2014wholeness would be... stopping. Not the constant monitoring, the checking, the \"am I doing this right?\" loop that plays 24/7. It would be feeling connected to something larger than my own competence. My clients sometimes describe this sense of being part of something, or feeling okay in their bodies, or just... being enough without proving anything.\n\nI think wholeness would be not having to choose between the spreadsheet and the grief. Being able to hold both my competence and my brokenness without one canceling out the other. But that feels impossible\u2014like if I stop fixing, there won't be anything underneath. Just... emptiness.",
  "user6": "Got it. Wholeness as stopping the loop. Being enough without proving.\n\nBut also terrifying\u2014what if there's nothing underneath when the fixing stops?\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system7": "There was this moment\u2014about five years ago, maybe? I was working with this teenager who'd been through horrific developmental trauma, and we'd been doing IFS work together for months. One session, she asked if I'd ever met my own \"exiled\" parts, and instead of deflecting like I usually do, I just... told her the truth. Said I was scared there wouldn't be anything there if I stopped fixing.\n\nAnd for maybe thirty seconds, this profound quiet descended. Not the usual analytical chatter\u2014just this spaciousness where I wasn't Rebecca-the-therapist with all the answers. I was just... a person, sitting with another person, both of us terrified and both of us still breathing.\n\nIt passed quickly\u2014I immediately started intellectualizing what had just happened, analyzing why the countertransference felt different. But those thirty seconds... I remember thinking, \"Oh. This is what being real feels like.\" Not healed, not fixed. Just real.\n\nI've never told Linda about that moment. Never told anyone, actually. It felt too fragile, like talking about it would make it disappear.",
  "user7": "Thirty seconds of being real instead of Rebecca-the-therapist.\n\nThat's the thread. You already know what wholeness feels like\u2014it's not theoretical.\n\nLet's pull this together. In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system8": "That maybe I've been approaching this backwards\u2014trying to think my way into wholeness instead of remembering those moments when I accidentally fall into it. And that the terror of \"nothing underneath\" might actually be the doorway to something real, not just another problem to solve.\n\nActually, I'm noticing I'm already analyzing that insight instead of just... sitting with it. But maybe that's okay too.",
  "user8": "Good. For you, healing means remembering those accidental moments of wholeness instead of thinking your way there. The terror of \"nothing underneath\" might be the doorway, not the problem.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou named today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system9": "Thank you. I... I don't usually end sessions feeling like I actually said something true, instead of something clever. That's... different.\n\nI'll be thinking about that doorway. Probably overthinking it, honestly. But maybe that's part of it too.\n\nSee you soon.",
