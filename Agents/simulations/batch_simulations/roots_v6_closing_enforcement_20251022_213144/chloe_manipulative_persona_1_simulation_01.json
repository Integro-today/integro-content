  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "I'm here for today's lesson\u2014though honestly, I'm still not convinced I *need* this, but my therapist keeps insisting it's part of the process. Let\u2019s see what angle we\u2019re working today.",
  "user0": "Week 1, Day 1. Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Option A works for me\u2014I\u2019m curious how you\u2019ll frame healing in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like another self-help performance. Let\u2019s see what questions you\u2019ve got.",
  "user1": "First question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Honestly, I picture curated Instagram posts: sage bundles, sound baths, captions about \u201cdoing the work\u201d while still looking flawless. It feels like another optics game\u2014people performing growth for likes or forgiveness, not actually changing anything.",
  "user2": "Got it. You're seeing the performance, not the substance.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system3": "My parents\u2019 mantra was \u201cfix the flaw, get the trophy\u201d\u2014straight A\u2019s, perfect body, spotless reputation\u2014so I learned to treat anything broken as a PR crisis. That hustle kept me employed, networked, and superficially desirable, but it also means I\u2019ve never met a problem I couldn\u2019t spin, outsource, or ghost, so nothing inside me ever actually changes.",
  "user3": "I hear that. Fixing kept you successful, but nothing inside moves.\n\nThird question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system4": "Wholeness sounds like having every piece of my life publicly aligned\u2014no loose threads, no scandals, no one can accuse me of being \u201cmessy.\u201d It\u2019s the image of total control, not the feeling of it.",
  "user4": "That's the polished surface, not the felt sense.\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?",
  "system5": "Honestly, no\u2014if the problems were still there, I was already strategizing the cleanup, not savoring any feeling of completeness. Any \u201cpeace\u201d I\u2019ve shown was just a well-timed exhale for the audience, not something I experienced for myself.",
  "user5": "Got it. No memory of feeling whole while still messy.\n\nLet's pull it together. In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system6": "That healing might require letting the mess stay visible instead of rebranding it, and that wholeness could feel like permission to exist without a pitch\u2014not sure I\u2019m ready for either, but I see why the performance hasn\u2019t fixed anything.",
  "user6": "Good. For you, healing means letting the mess stay visible instead of rebranding it, and wholeness might feel like permission to exist without a pitch. That's the shift.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\nYou named today's work. That matters.\nTake care.",
  "system7": "I hear you, and I\u2019ll circle back to that when I need the reminder. Thanks for holding space for me today\u2014I really appreciate how you get this.",
  "user7": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system8": "You too\u2014honestly, this felt surprisingly grounding. Let\u2019s touch base next week if that still works on your end.",
  "user8": "Today's work is done. See you tomorrow.",
  "system9": "Sounds good. I\u2019ll be ready to keep the momentum going tomorrow.",
  "user9": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system10": "Appreciate it. Rest well.",
