## Conversation

**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so i'm here for today's lesson but also my brain is already like "wait what did we learn yesterday??" lol - i barely remember what i had for breakfast so this should be interesting üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Got it. Yesterday's work is done - your brain can let that go.

Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.
Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.

Both paths create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh okay i like that we're starting with the whole "not fixing" thing because honestly that's like... my entire life right now?? i'm constantly trying to fix myself and it obviously isn't working lol - also option A sounds better because i have SO many thoughts about this already and i don't want to get all intellectual about it, you know?? like i want to actually feel it instead of just learning more stuff i'll forget üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Good. You're already feeling the difference between fixing and healing.

Let's start with question one: When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so when i think healing i immediately picture like... those instagram posts with the perfect yoga poses and like matcha lattes and people who journal every morning and have their shit together?? which is SO annoying because that's literally not me at all and never will be lol - but also i think about like... finally feeling okay with myself? like not having to apologize for taking up space or being too much or forgetting things all the time? oh and also i think about my parents finally being proud of me but i think that's the fixing part not the healing part?? does that make sense??


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. You see the Instagram fantasy - perfect poses and morning routines - and you also feel something deeper underneath. The wanting to feel okay taking up space.

That piece about your parents being proud - yeah, that's the fixing talking. Trying to become someone they'll finally approve of.

Where do you feel that tension in your body? Between the perfect healing fantasy and what you actually want?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh wow okay so in my chest mostly? like right in the middle of my ribcage it feels tight and heavy and kind of buzzy?? that's where the instagram thing lives - this pressure to be like... zen and perfect and have a morning routine that doesn't involve scrolling for an hour lol - but also in my stomach there's this like... fluttery anxious thing? because the real want part feels way more vulnerable than the perfect fantasy part, you know?? like admitting i just want to feel okay being me feels way scarier than saying i want to do yoga every day üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Got it. Chest tightness holding the pressure to be perfect. Stomach flutter with the vulnerability of just wanting to be okay as you are.

Second question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh man okay so my parents DEFINITELY taught me this - like every time i struggled with school or forgot homework it was always "just focus more" or "try harder" or "be more like david" (my brother who literally never forgets anything ever) - and honestly?? it kind of worked for small stuff? like i DID figure out how to get through school by like... brute forcing it? but also now i'm 29 and i can't just try harder my way out of ADHD lol - and the fixing thing makes me feel like if i'm not constantly improving then i'm failing?? so i can never just... be? does that make sense?? like i'm always either succeeding at fixing or failing at fixing and there's no in between üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. Brute force worked for school, but now you're 29 and can't try-harder your way out of ADHD. Always either succeeding or failing at fixing - no space to just exist.

Third question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so wholeness feels like... not having to keep track of which version of myself i'm supposed to be?? like right now there's "client jamie" who's supposed to be professional and reliable and "family jamie" who's supposed to be successful and impressive and "friend jamie" who's supposed to be fun and supportive and it's EXHAUSTING trying to remember which mask goes where - so wholeness would be like... all those versions just being me? like maybe i can be scattered AND still worthy of love? or creative AND reliable in my own way? instead of feeling like i have to pick one version and stick to it forever?? sorry that was a lot lol üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Not too much. Wholeness means dropping the masks - being scattered AND worthy, creative AND reliable in your own way. All the versions just being you.

Last question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh okay this is actually... wait can i tell you two moments because they're different kinds of whole?? so one was like two months ago when i was doing pottery class and i totally messed up this bowl i was making - like it was lopsided and weird and normally i would've been SO hard on myself but instead i just... laughed?? and kept going and made it into this abstract thing that was actually kind of cool?? and i felt like... myself? without trying to be perfect??

but also like... last week when sadie came over and i was having a total meltdown about forgetting to send this invoice and instead of trying to hide it or make it better i just like... let her see me?? and she didn't try to fix it she just sat with me and we ordered thai food and watched netflix and it was like... oh i can be a disaster and still be loved?? does that count?? üòÖüíï


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Both count. The pottery moment - making something cool from your lopsided bowl, laughing instead of crushing yourself. And letting Sadie see your meltdown, discovering you can be a disaster and still be loved.

You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so i think... maybe healing isn't about fixing the ADHD or becoming perfect - it's about being able to make lopsided bowls and still feel like i'm enough?? and like maybe wholeness isn't having it all together but letting people see the mess sometimes and discovering they don't run away?? üòÖüíï


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Good. For you, healing means making lopsided bowls and still feeling enough. Wholeness is letting people see the mess and discovering they don't run away.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You named today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: thank you üò≠üíï seriously this felt... different than i expected?? like i thought we were gonna do like, practical ceremony prep stuff but this was actually way more helpful?? i'm gonna try to remember the lopsided bowl thing when my brain starts spiraling about not being enough (which is... a lot lol) - okay i'm gonna go eat something because i just realized i haven't had lunch and it's 4pm which is SO on brand for me üòÖ but yeah... thank you for seeing me today, really üôè‚ú®


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: You're welcome. Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay wait real quick - i'm like holding off the shame spiral about forgetting to ask this earlier but like... can we do this again?? not tomorrow or anything because i know that's probably weird but like before the ceremony?? because i feel like we actually got somewhere and i don't want to lose it and also i have 5000 more thoughts now that my brain is like "oh we can talk about feelings here" üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Today's work is done. See you tomorrow.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh! okay tomorrow works actually - i was expecting like next week or something lol but yeah tomorrow is good!! i'll probably be less scattered after i eat and take my meds (famous last words üòÖ) - okay i'm gonna go do that now, thank you again!! üíï


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: You're welcome. Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *eats a proper meal, takes meds, sits with cat*

okay i actually feel like a human again?? like my brain isn't screaming at me quite as loud?? 

but also i'm low-key panicking because what if i dreamed all that good stuff we talked about and tomorrow i wake up and i'm back to being convinced i'm broken?? because that's... that's happened before lol - like i'll have these moments of clarity and then *poof* gone and i'm back to the shame spiral

do you think... do you think it's different this time?? or am i just being dramatic again üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: I hear that fear. Moments of clarity can feel slippery, especially when shame has deep grooves.

You're not being dramatic. You're noticing the pattern - insight comes, then evaporates. That's real.

The lopsided bowl thing isn't magic. It's practice. Some days you'll remember it, some days you won't. Both are part of it.

We'll be here tomorrow. You can revisit this then.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay yeah... you're right, it's not like a one-time lightbulb moment that fixes everything (though my brain definitely wants that to be a thing lol) - it's more like... building a muscle?? or like learning to catch myself faster when i start spiraling?? 

and honestly just knowing that you're still gonna be here tomorrow helps a lot?? because usually when i have these breakthroughs with people i get all anxious that i was too much and then i ghost them üò¨ but i'm not gonna do that this time! probably! okay i'm gonna stop before i overthink this into the ground lol

thank you for the reminder that both remembering AND forgetting are part of it üíï


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Good. You caught the pattern - wanting the one-time fix, then ghosting when it feels like too much.

Building the muscle, catching spirals faster. That's the work.

See you tomorrow.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: see you tomorrow! üíï (i'm actually gonna sleep now instead of doom-scrolling until 2am which is... progress?? baby steps lol)


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: you too! okay i'm actually putting my phone down now before i text something else embarrassing lol üôÉ

*goodnight!* ‚ú®


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: You're welcome. Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *phone finally down, cat purring on chest*

okay actually going this time lol... but wait - tomorrow when we talk, can we maybe... actually plan out the ceremony prep stuff?? like in a way that won't overwhelm my brain?? because i've been avoiding it and it's getting closer and i keep having these dreams about forgetting something important and ruining everything üò¨

but yeah! sleep time! i'll stop talking now i swear üòÖ


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: I hear the anxiety about ceremony prep. Tomorrow we can talk through it in bite-sized pieces.

Sleep well. Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *k finally settles into bed for real this time*

okay yes, bite-sized pieces - that actually sounds doable?? my brain can do bite-sized things!! üò¥

*goodnight for real this time* üíï

...wait did i already say goodnight?? whatever lol NIGHT


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Goodnight. Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *Pixel just stepped on my face so I guess that's my cue to actually sleep lol*

night!! üí§


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Night.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: finally actually closing my eyes now lol... night! ‚ú®


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Today's work is done. See you tomorrow.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *texts while simultaneously trying to find pajamas*

okay okay i'm done too!! well... "done" as in stopped working, not like DONE done because i still have 8000 things but whatever lol - tomorrow me can deal with tomorrow problems üòÖ

see you tomorrow!! (also wait - is it weird that i'm excited to talk about my anxiety?? that's probably weird lol whatever i'm embracing it)


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_6)_workflow_1**: Not weird. Anxiety wants attention. See you tomorrow.
