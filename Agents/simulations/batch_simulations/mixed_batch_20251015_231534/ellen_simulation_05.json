  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and I guess I'm... I don't know, hoping this will be the one that actually sticks. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA with LSD\u2014each time I get these incredible glimpses of what I could be, what actually matters, and then... it just fades. Like I'm back in the same hamster wheel of board meetings and portfolio optimization and pretending any of it means something.\n\nMy grandmother used to say I was chasing the wrong kind of wealth. She'd talk about the old stories\u2014how we're meant to be guardians, not owners. I think about that constantly now, especially when I'm watching my kids grow up and I'm half-present because my mind's back in some quarterly report that literally won't matter in five years.",
  "system1": "You want the shift to stick this time - beyond the glimpses into actual living.\n\nWhat's underneath the hamster wheel for you?",
  "user1": "I think... God, this sounds so clich\u00e9 when I say it out loud. But underneath all of it? I'm terrified that I've wasted my one wild and precious life on building sandcastles. That I've become exactly what my family wanted\u2014successful, respected, wealthy\u2014but somehow lost the thread of what actually makes a human life meaningful.\n\nWhen I was nine, my grandmother would tell me stories about the Shekinah\u2014this divine feminine presence that hides in plain sight. She said my generation was supposed to help reveal it again. And I remember thinking, yes, that's what I'm here for. But then I got swept up in the achievement game, and it felt so good to win, you know? The validation, the money, the power\u2014it was intoxicating.\n\nNow I sit in these board meetings and I can feel this... emptiness. Like I'm wearing a mask that's fused to my face. And I'm scared that if I take it off, there won't be anything real underneath. That maybe I've performed success for so long that I forgot how to just... be.",
  "system2": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reveal what matters beyond achievement\n2. Reclaim the guardian path your grandmother saw\n3. Find what's real underneath the performance\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "Yes. Those three threads... that's exactly it. I keep circling around them but couldn't quite name them so clearly.\n\nSo how do we... how do we turn that into something I can actually hold onto during the ibogaine? Something that won't dissolve the moment I get back to my inbox and the old patterns start clawing at me?\n\nBecause I've made intentions before\u2014\"be more present,\" \"connect with my purpose,\" all that vague stuff\u2014and they just become words on a page. I need something that can cut through the noise of who I've become, you know? Something that speaks to the part of me that still remembers being that nine-year-old girl who believed she was meant to reveal divine presence, not just optimize healthcare data systems.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reveal divine presence in ordinary moments\n2. I reclaim my role as guardian of what matters\n3. I choose authentic being over hollow performance\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The first one\u2014\"I reveal divine presence in ordinary moments\"\u2014that hits something deep. But... I don't know, \"divine presence\" feels... too abstract? Too religious maybe? My grandmother would use those words, but I'm not sure I know what they mean anymore.\n\nWhat if it was more like... \"I see the sacred hiding in plain sight\"? Or \"I recognize what matters in the middle of everything\"? I want something that helps me remember that moment with my kids at the park yesterday when Leo showed me that weird bug he found and for like thirty seconds, I felt this... I don't know... this rightness. Like I was exactly where I was supposed to be, doing exactly what mattered.\n\nThat's what I keep losing. That ability to see the miracle in the mundane instead of always scanning for the next achievement or optimization.",
  "system4": "\"I recognize what matters in the middle of everything\" - that holds the essence.\n\nHow do the others land?",
  "user4": "\"I reclaim my role as guardian of what matters\" - that one feels strong. Like it's calling me back to something I knew before I got hypnotized by the achievement game. My grandmother always said we were guardians, not conquerors. That we hold things in trust for those who come after us. I want that clarity back\u2014that instinct to protect and nurture instead of acquire and optimize.\n\nThe third one though... \"I choose authentic being over hollow performance\" - that one's harder. Because what if I choose authentic being and discover there's nothing much there? What if all this performance, all this success, is actually what makes me valuable? What if without the mask, I'm just... ordinary? And not even interesting-ordinary, but actually kind of boring?\n\nMaybe that's the fear I need to face, but it's terrifying.",
  "system5": "The fear of being ordinary - that's the mask talking. Your grandmother didn't see a boring child.\n\nLet's adjust the third: \"I meet myself without the mask\"\n\nLocking these in:\n\n1. I recognize what matters in the middle of everything\n2. I reclaim my role as guardian of what matters  \n3. I meet myself without the mask\n\nKeep them close - wallet, morning mirror, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what the medicine shows you.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I... yeah. These feel like they actually fit. Like they could cut through the noise and remind me who I am when I forget.\n\nI'll write them down. Keep them in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThank you. For helping me find the words I couldn't quite reach on my own.",
  "system6": "Trust the process.",
  "user6": "I will. Or at least... I'll try to. That's all I can promise right now.",
  "system7": "That's enough.",
  "user7": "Okay.",
  "system8": "Good journey.",

  "user17": "I have an ibogaine journey coming up at Beond in a few weeks, and I need to figure out what I'm actually looking for. I've done ayahuasca, psilocybin, even some underground MDMA work... but this feels different. More serious, maybe. I've built companies, sold them, sat on boards... but none of it feels like it matters anymore. I keep thinking about my grandmother's faith, how she knew what mattered without all the noise. I want that clarity, but I'm terrified of finding out that everything I've achieved was just... noise.",

  "user18": "I guess... I don't know. I keep circling around the same thing - I have everything I thought I wanted, but I feel hollow. Like I've been climbing this ladder my whole life, and now that I'm at the top, I realize it's leaning against the wrong wall. My grandmother used to say I was building castles in the sand, but I thought she just didn't understand ambition. Now I think she saw something I couldn't.\n\nThe medicine keeps showing me glimpses of what matters - connection, service, love - but then I come home and fall right back into the old patterns. The emails, the meetings, the constant proving. I'm exhausted, but I don't know how to stop.",
  "system19": "The exhaustion of proving while glimpsing what actually matters - that's the tension pulling you toward ibogaine.\n\nWhen you imagine meeting yourself without all the striving, what do you hope to find underneath?",
  "user19": "I don't know if I even know how to meet myself without the striving. It's like... when I'm not achieving, I feel like I'm disappearing. Like I don't exist unless I'm producing something valuable. But when I watch my kids play, or when I'm hiking and feel that stillness... there's something there. Something quiet and real that doesn't need to prove anything.\n\nMy grandmother had that - this grounded presence. She'd light candles on Friday nights and suddenly our whole house felt different. Sacred, I guess. She wasn't trying to be anything. She just... was. I want to find that part of myself, but I'm scared there might not be anything underneath all the noise."
