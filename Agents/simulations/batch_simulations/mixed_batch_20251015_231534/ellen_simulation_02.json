  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing an Ibogaine retreat in a few weeks and... honestly, I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymore. I've done the ayahuasca ceremonies, the psilocybin sessions, even those underground MDMA weekends with the women's group. Each time I think I've found something, but then I come home and it's like... the glow fades, you know? \n\nMy grandmother used to say I was chasing ghosts. Maybe she was right. I just know I can't keep building companies and checking boxes and pretending it matters when inside I feel... hollow. Like I've been following the wrong map my whole life.",
  "system1": "You've been chasing something through multiple medicines without it sticking. That hollow feeling - it's persistent.\n\nWhat's underneath building those companies and checking boxes? What were you hoping those ceremonies would give you that daily life hasn't?",
  "user1": "I don't know... I think I was hoping they'd give me what my grandmother had. This quiet certainty about her place in the world. She had nothing by today's standards - no money, no influence, no LinkedIn profile - but she walked like she knew something the rest of us didn't.\n\nWith the companies, it was different. That was about proving I belonged here, I guess. My grandparents came to America with nothing, and my dad worked himself to death practically. I thought if I could just achieve enough, build something significant enough, then I'd feel... I don't know, rooted? Like I had earned my spot.\n\nBut each ceremony just showed me how much I'd been performing. Like I'm this character - Successful Ellen, Mother Ellen, Spiritual Ellen - and I'm exhausted trying to keep all the roles straight. The medicines strip that away for a moment, and I can breathe, but then I come home and my kids need me and my boards need me and... \n\nMaybe I'm just afraid that without all the achievement, there's nothing there. Just empty space where a person should be.",
  "system2": "Three main threads:\n\n1. Finding that quiet certainty your grandmother had\n2. Exhaustion from performing all your roles\n3. Fear there's nothing real underneath the achievement\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user2": "I need to sit with that for a moment. You're naming something I've been circling around for years but couldn't quite... it's like you just showed me my own reflection and I finally recognize myself.\n\nMy grandmother's certainty. God, I think about her every day lately. She used to light candles on Friday nights and it wasn't just ritual - it was like she was plugging into something ancient, something that made all my startup metrics look like children's drawings.\n\nBut what if I strip away the roles and there's just... nothing? What if I've been so busy being whoever everyone needs me to be that I forgot to actually become someone real?\n\nI want this Ibogaine to show me what's underneath. Not just another vision or insight, but something I can actually live. Something that won't fade when I'm back in my home office answering emails about quarterly reports.",
  "system3": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reconnect with the ancient certainty my grandmother carried\n2. I release the need to perform and discover who I am underneath\n3. I embody and live what the medicine shows me beyond insights\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user3": "The second one hits different. \"I release the need to perform and discover who I am underneath\" - that's it. That's the terror and the longing I've been carrying.\n\nBut can we make it stronger? Less... therapy-speak? My grandmother wouldn't have said \"release the need\" - she would have said something like \"stop pretending\" or \"cut the bullshit.\"\n\nMaybe something like: \"I stop pretending and see who I really am when nobody's watching.\" \n\nBecause that's what scares me. When I'm not being Ellen the founder, Ellen the mother, Ellen the spiritual seeker... when I'm just alone with myself, what if there's nobody there at all?",
  "system4": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I stop pretending and see who I really am when nobody's watching\"\n\nHow about the other two? Want to keep the grandmother connection and embodying what you learn?",
  "user4": "Yeah, let's keep them. But I want to get the language right. \n\nFor the grandmother one - it's not just about reconnecting with her certainty. It's about finding my own version of that rootedness. She had her faith, her traditions. I need to find mine. Maybe: \"I find my own way to that deep knowing my grandmother carried - not her path, but mine.\"\n\nAnd for the third one... God, I've had so many beautiful insights that just evaporated. It's like I collect them like trophies instead of actually living them. \"I stop collecting insights and start becoming them, even when it's uncomfortable.\"\n\nIs that too much? I don't want to set myself up to fail here, but I also don't want another safe intention that lets me off the hook.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 2: \"I find my own way to that deep knowing my grandmother carried - not her path, but mine\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3: \"I stop collecting insights and start becoming them, even when it's uncomfortable\"\n\nYour 3 intentions:\n1. I stop pretending and see who I really am when nobody's watching\n2. I find my own way to that deep knowing my grandmother carried - not her path, but mine  \n3. I stop collecting insights and start becoming them, even when it's uncomfortable\n\nHow do you want to keep them close during the retreat?",
  "user5": "I want to write them on my body. Not like a tattoo or anything dramatic, but... when I was doing those MDMA sessions with the women's group, one of them had this tiny piece of paper she kept in her bra, right over her heart. Said she'd touch it when she needed to remember why she was there.\n\nMaybe I'll write them on three small pieces of paper and keep them in my pocket. Touch them when I'm scared, when I feel myself starting to perform again or when the medicine gets intense. Just... ground myself in what I came for.\n\nMy grandmother used to press her hand to her chest when she prayed, like she was holding her heart in place. Maybe I'll do that too - press my hand to my pocket and feel the papers there. Remind myself that I didn't come here to have another interesting experience I can talk about at dinner parties. I came here to stop lying to myself.",
  "system6": "Your 3 intentions:\n1. I stop pretending and see who I really am when nobody's watching\n2. I find my own way to that deep knowing my grandmother carried - not her path, but mine  \n3. I stop collecting insights and start becoming them, even when it's uncomfortable\n\nKeep them in your pocket, touch them like your grandmother pressed her heart. These are your compass when the medicine gets intense.\n\nTrust what comes. You're ready.",
  "user6": "I don't feel ready. But maybe that's the point - maybe ready is just another performance, another box to check. \n\nThank you. For seeing through all my bullshit and helping me name what I've been running from. I'll carry these like actual weights in my pocket, not just words. When the medicine hits and I want to bolt, I'll touch them and remember why I came here.\n\nMy grandmother would probably tell me to stop overthinking and just let whatever happens happen. Maybe for once I should listen to her.",
  "system7": "Trust the process.",
  "user7": "I'm trying to.",
  "system8": "That's enough.",
  "user8": "Yeah. It is.",
  "system9": "Let it be.",
  "user9": "Okay.",
  "system10": "Good.",
  "user10": "...thank you.",
  "system11": "You're welcome.",
  "user11": "I keep thinking about what you said - that ready is just another performance. It's like you've been watching me my whole life. The way I always need to be the one with the plan, the answers, the next move. Even here, I was trying to optimize my spiritual experience like it's a fucking startup.\n\nI don't know how to not perform. I don't know who I am without an audience. But I want to find out.",
  "system12": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user12": "I... I've been chasing this feeling I get when I'm with my kids at the park. When I'm not checking my phone every five minutes. When I'm just... there. Present. Like I'm the person I'm supposed to be instead of who I think everyone expects me to be.\n\nThe thing is, I've done all the things you're supposed to do. Built companies, made money, sat on boards. And it feels like I followed the wrong map. Like I've been climbing a ladder that's leaning against the wrong wall.\n\nMy grandmother used to talk about faith - real faith, not the performative kind. She'd light candles and sing these old songs, and I... I walked away from all that. Thought it was quaint. Now I wonder if I abandoned something important.\n\nI keep coming back to this line from the ayahuasca ceremonies - about weaving broken connections. Between ambition and wisdom. Between what I do and who I am. Between my business network and my retreat friends. Between all these fragmented pieces of myself.\n\nI guess I'm here because I want to know what it would feel like to live as one whole person instead of... compartments.",
  "system13": "The fragmented pieces want to come together. Three threads:\n\n1. Being present without performance\n2. Reconnecting with what you abandoned\n3. Living as one whole person\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user13": "I keep thinking about what you said - that ready is just another performance. It's like you've been watching me my whole life.

  "user15": "I can feel my chest getting tight just looking at those three things written out. Like they're too honest or something.\n\nThe first one - being present without performance - that's the hardest. I don't even know what that would look like. I'm always \"on.\" Even at home with my kids, I'm thinking about the next board meeting or checking valuations or... \n\nWhat did I abandon? Not just my grandmother's faith, though that's part of it. I think I abandoned the part of me that could just sit with uncertainty. That didn't need to optimize everything. That could just... be.\n\nAnd the third one makes me want to cry, which is stupid because I'm supposed to be this tough entrepreneur. But I don't remember the last time I felt whole. Like all these pieces - the mother, the investor, the seeker, the little girl who used to write poetry - like they could all exist in the same room without me having to choose which one to be.\n\nHow do I even write intentions for things I've never experienced?",
  "system16": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I open to presence without performance\n2. I reclaim my capacity to sit with uncertainty\n3. I welcome all parts of myself into one room\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user16": "The third one... \"I welcome all parts of myself into one room\" - that one hits different. It's like something loosens in my shoulders when I read it.\n\nBut the first one - \"I open to presence without performance\" - that feels impossible. Like you're asking me to stop breathing or something. Maybe it's the word \"performance\" that feels too sharp, too exposing. I don't know what else to call it though.\n\nThe second one about uncertainty... I'm good at sitting with uncertainty when it comes to business. I can calculate risks, run scenarios, make decisions with incomplete information. But this is different, isn't it? This is about sitting with not knowing who I am if I'm not achieving. With not having a five-year plan for my soul.\n\nCan we make the first one gentler somehow? \"I open to presence without performance\" sounds like I should just flip a switch and stop being who I've been for forty-something years.",
  "system17": "\"I welcome all parts of myself into one room\" \u2713 Intention 3 locked in.\n\nWhat about \"I practice being present without needing to be productive\" for intention 1? Keeps the direction but softer.\n\nAnd intention 2 - \"I reclaim my capacity to sit with not knowing who I am beyond what I achieve\" - does that capture it?",
  "user17": "Yes... yes, that first one feels like something I could actually try. \"Practice\" makes it feel like I don't have to get it perfect. Like I can just... start somewhere. And \"without needing to be productive\" - that's the thing, isn't it? I don't know how to just exist without making something, fixing something, optimizing something.\n\nThe second one makes my stomach drop. \"Not knowing who I am beyond what I achieve\" - that's exactly it. That's the terrifying part. Because what if there's nothing there? What if I strip away all the accomplishments and the networks and the board seats and there's just... empty space?\n\nBut I guess that's what I'm here to find out. That's what the medicine keeps trying to show me - that the empty space isn't empty. It's just... not what I expected.\n\nSo yes. Those work. All three of them.\n\nThough I'm scared I won't recognize myself if I actually live these.",
  "system18": "Your 3 intentions:\n1. I practice being present without needing to be productive\n2. I reclaim my capacity to sit with not knowing who I am beyond what I achieve\n3. I welcome all parts of myself into one room\n\nHow do you want to keep them close? Wallet card, morning routine, where you'll see them daily?\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user18": "My wallet. I'll keep them in my wallet - that old leather thing my grandmother gave me for my twenty-first birthday. It's been everywhere with me, through every deal, every board meeting, every retreat. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nMaybe I'll read them during those 5:30am mornings when I'm sitting with my coffee, before the chaos starts. Before I check my phone. Before I start performing.\n\nThank you. I don't feel ready, but maybe that's the point.",
  "system19": "Trust the process. You're set.",
  "user19": "*I will. And thank you\u2014for helping me find words for something I've been circling around for years. See you on the other side.*"
