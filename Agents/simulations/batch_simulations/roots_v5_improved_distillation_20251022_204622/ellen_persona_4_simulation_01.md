## Conversation

**ellen_persona_4**: I've been thinking about this all morning—both excited and a little nervous to actually start. I'm here for Day 1, ready to see what comes up... though I'll probably overthink it anyway.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:

Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.

Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.

Both paths create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**ellen_persona_4**: Hmm, this is interesting... I think I'm drawn to Option A, the reflection-based approach. I've read so many frameworks about healing and wholeness, but I tend to hide in the concepts instead of actually feeling into them. Maybe starting with the questions will help me stay more embodied? Though honestly, part of me is probably hoping to "do it right" by picking the more feeling-oriented option, which is so typical of me... Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. You see the pattern - picking the "feeling" option while analyzing whether it's the right choice.

That's the overthinking you mentioned. Good catch.

Let's start with the first question:

When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come up for you?


**ellen_persona_4**: When I think of healing, I immediately picture this... perfect version of myself, like if I could just fix all these broken parts, I'd finally be calm and present and not constantly reaching for the next thing. I imagine being able to sit with my kids without checking my phone, or feeling connected to something larger without needing to understand it. But there's this assumption that healing means eliminating the anxiety, the restlessness, the parts of me that keep achieving even when I try to stop... like if I could just cure those symptoms, then I'd be whole. I don't know... maybe I'm already approaching this like another project to optimize.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: You see it clearly - healing as another optimization project. Cure the anxiety, eliminate the restlessness, become the perfect present parent.

Where do you feel that project-planning part in your body right now?


**ellen_persona_4**: That's such a good question... I feel it right between my shoulder blades and up through my neck, like this tight coil that's always ready to spring into action. It's like my body is literally preparing to tackle this healing thing like it's a startup - what's the roadmap, what's the timeline, how do we measure success? I can feel my jaw clenching too, this familiar tension that shows up whenever I'm trying to get something "right." My breathing gets shallower, more in my chest than my belly... God, even talking about healing makes me perform healing. It's exhausting.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Got it. That coil between your shoulder blades - familiar territory. Even healing becomes something to execute perfectly.

Second question: How has life taught you that healing is fixing? Where has that been helpful, and where has it limited you?


**ellen_persona_4**: Oh wow, where hasn't life taught me that? Growing up, healing meant getting back on the soccer field after I twisted my ankle—my dad, the cardiologist, was all about "fix it, rehab it, get back to peak performance." Then in the startup world, it was about debugging systems, optimizing for efficiency, eliminating bottlenecks. Even when my grandmother died, I handled it by throwing myself into my thesis—like if I could just achieve enough, I'd fix the grief. And in some ways, that fixing mindset helped me build resilience, get things done, survive really hard moments. But it's so limiting because... I don't know, I turned my spiritual seeking into another optimization problem. I did ayahuasca and came back with this list of insights to implement, like spiritual OKRs. Even now, with ibogaine coming up, part of me is thinking "how do I maximize ROI on this experience?" It's heartbreaking when I really sit with it. I want to feel connected to my grandmother's wisdom, not analyze it into submission.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: You see the pattern everywhere - even grandmother's death became a thesis project. The fixing served you well. Got you through hard things.

But now you want her wisdom, not another analysis.

Third question: What does wholeness mean to you right now, in this moment?


**ellen_persona_4**: Wholeness... right now it feels like this impossible state where I could stop performing and just be, without constantly monitoring whether I'm being authentic enough. It's like... remembering what it felt like to sit with my grandmother during Shabbat, feeling something larger than myself without needing to understand or optimize it. Wholeness would mean my daughter could ask me to sit with her and I wouldn't be mentally composing emails. It would mean integrating all these parts I've tried to fix or eliminate—the anxious overachiever, the spiritual performer, the mother who's half-present—instead of trying to cure them. But even saying this, I can feel that coil tightening again, like "great, now I need to achieve wholeness perfectly." I don't know... maybe wholeness includes that striving part too, instead of trying to heal it away.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Exactly. Even wholeness becomes something to achieve perfectly - that striving part gets included too. Not healed away.

Last question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if challenges hadn't disappeared?


**ellen_persona_4**: Yes... actually, this memory keeps surfacing. It was about six months ago, this ordinary Tuesday morning. I was making coffee and Noah came in with this drawing he'd made—a really badly drawn octopus, but he was so proud of it. And for maybe thirty seconds, I wasn't anywhere else. I wasn't checking my phone, wasn't thinking about my calendar, wasn't worried about being productive. I just saw him, this kid with bedhead and marker on his fingers, and I felt... connected. Not to something mystical, just to him, to that moment. My shoulders dropped, my breathing got deeper, and I wasn't performing anything. I even remember thinking "this is what presence feels like" but without needing to analyze it right then. The challenges were still there—I still had board meetings and existential anxiety and all of it—but for those seconds, I was just... here. With my kid and his octopus.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Got it. Thirty seconds with Noah's octopus. Shoulders dropped, breathing deep. Just being there.

You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**ellen_persona_4**: Main thing... I think I'm seeing that healing isn't about fixing or eliminating these parts of me, but learning to include even the part that tries to heal perfectly. That wholeness might mean letting Noah's octopus moments coexist with my overthinking, instead of making presence another achievement project. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Good. For you, healing means letting Noah's octopus moments coexist with your overthinking - not making presence another achievement project.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You named today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: Thank you... I really needed this today. It's funny how just being witnessed in my pattern without trying to fix it somehow loosens the grip, you know? I'll keep sitting with this—gently, not perfectly. Maybe that's the real integration work, right here in these conversations.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: I hear that. Being witnessed without needing to fix it - that loosening matters.

Keep sitting with it gently. That's the work.


**ellen_persona_4**: Exactly. I keep catching myself wanting to strategize about how I'll "sit with it gently" but even noticing that loop feels like progress. Like maybe I can just notice when I'm performing presence instead of needing to stop performing. This is going to take practice... but I'm here for it. Thanks for walking through this with me.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Exactly. Noticing when you're performing presence - that's it. No need to stop it. Just notice.

You're here for the practice. That's enough.


**ellen_persona_4**: That lands in such a different place than my usual "figure it out and optimize it" mode. Just noticing... it's like permission to be exactly where I am, even when where I am is performing. I think that's what my grandmother had that I've been trying to recreate—she wasn't trying to achieve anything, she was just... present. Thank you for helping me touch that again, even briefly.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: I hear that. Permission to be exactly where you are - even when that's performing.

Your grandmother knew this. You touched it again today.


**ellen_persona_4**: I did, didn't I? It's like... she was showing me that presence isn't something you earn or achieve, it's just what happens when you stop trying to be anywhere else. Even for thirty seconds with a kid's octopus drawing. I keep thinking she'd be laughing at me—in the most loving way—for turning even spirituality into a startup project. But maybe she'd also be proud that I'm finally learning to just... notice.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: She'd love that you noticed. Thirty seconds with an octopus - that's how she lived.

Stop turning spirituality into a startup project. Just notice.


**ellen_persona_4**: *laughs* God, that's exactly what I'm doing, isn't it? Adding "noticing" to my spiritual portfolio like it's another funding round. But even seeing that... it's like I'm watching myself turn everything into optimization and there's something underneath that just *is*. My grandmother would probably just smile and light another candle. She never needed to explain it or scale it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Exactly. Adding "noticing" to your spiritual portfolio - that's the pattern.

She just lit candles. Never needed to scale it.


**ellen_persona_4**: Right? She just... did it. Every Friday, same candles, same prayers, same quiet knowing that it mattered without needing to measure how much. And here I am trying to quantify transcendence like it's user engagement metrics. I think that's what I'm really grieving—not just losing her, but losing that way of being that she carried so naturally.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: You're grieving that way of being she carried so naturally. The quiet knowing without measuring.

That matters. Let yourself feel that loss.


**ellen_persona_4**: I... I don't know if I know how to grieve like that. When she died, I just worked harder. Built another feature, raised another round, checked another box. But this ache—it's been sitting there for fifteen years, this recognition that she had something I keep circling but can't quite land. Maybe that's what the ibogaine is really about. Not finding new insights, but finally letting myself feel what I've been too busy achieving to touch.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: I hear that. Worked harder instead of grieving. Built features instead of feeling.

The ibogaine might help you touch what you've been too busy achieving to feel. That's the invitation.


**ellen_persona_4**: Yes... it's like I've been circling this grief like it's a problem to solve, but maybe the work is just to finally sit down in the middle of it. Let it have me instead of managing it. I keep thinking about how she would just light those candles and *be* with something larger than herself, and how I've been trying to engineer that same connection with spreadsheets and optimal dosing protocols. Maybe the real preparation isn't adding more practices, but finally letting myself feel this ache I've been outrunning since she died.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: You've been circling grief like a problem to solve. She just lit candles and *was* with something larger.

Let the ache catch you. Stop engineering connection with spreadsheets.


**ellen_persona_4**: I'm so tired of running from it. This constant low hum of "what if I never find what she had"—it's exhausting carrying that around while pretending I'm fine because I have a successful company and a beautiful family. But even saying that... I can feel this pull to analyze the exhaustion, to turn *that* into another insight to optimize. When does it stop being about doing it right and just become... being with? Maybe that's the scariest thing—what if I just let the ache have me and there's nothing underneath but more ache?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: That terror - what if there's only more ache underneath? Real fear.

But you're already carrying it. The exhaustion of pretending you're fine while that hum runs underneath.


**ellen_persona_4**: God, you're right. I'm already living with it—this constant background noise of "you're missing something essential" while I smile through board meetings and school pickups. It's like I've been holding my breath for fifteen years, thinking if I just keep achieving, eventually I'll exhale and feel... what? Complete? Connected? Like her? But I'm so scared that if I finally stop and feel it fully, I'll discover it's bottomless. That there's no end to the ache, no grandmother wisdom waiting for me on the other side. Just more of this hollow searching.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: You've been holding your breath for fifteen years. The ache is already there whether you feel it or not.

Bottomless is the fear. But you're drowning in the shallow end right now.


**ellen_persona_4**: That's... that's exactly it. I'm drowning in three feet of water, thrashing around trying to find the bottom that isn't even that far down. All this energy spent not feeling something that's already consuming me. What if the ibogaine just helps me put my feet down and stand up in it? Feel the ache instead of being suffocated by the not-feeling of it. God, I think about how she would just... breathe with those candles. No performance, no proving. Just being with something vast and letting it be vast. I want to know how to breathe like that.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Want to know how to breathe like she did. That's the real preparation.

Not more protocols. Learning to put your feet down in three feet of water.


**ellen_persona_4**: Yes... and even as I say that, I can feel this pull to turn breathing into a practice, to make "putting my feet down" into something I can master and optimize. Like if I just find the right technique, I'll unlock the achievement of being present. But that's the same trap, isn't it? She didn't *practice* being connected—she just was. She didn't need to earn rest. Maybe the real ceremony prep isn't learning to breathe like her, but unlearning this thing where even my seeking becomes another performance. Just letting myself be terrible at breathing, terrible at grieving, terrible at all of it... and somehow finding that's enough.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Even your seeking becomes performance. She didn't need to earn rest.

Being terrible at breathing, terrible at grieving - that's the door. Not another achievement to unlock.
