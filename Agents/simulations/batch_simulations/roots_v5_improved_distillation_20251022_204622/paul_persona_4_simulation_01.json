  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Got into Heroic Hearts. Headed to Costa Rica in three weeks. Amanda thinks this'll help. I dont know.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\n\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Look i just need to sleep through the night. Dont care about frameworks. Option A i guess.",
  "user1": "Got it. You need sleep. That's real.\n\nFirst question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "I picture guys with missing legs doing physical therapy. Or those group therapy circles where everyone cries. Thats not me.",
  "user2": "I hear that. Physical therapy and group circles - that's what healing looks like in your mind.\n\nWhere do you feel that disconnect in your body when you imagine yourself in those spaces?",
  "system3": "My chest gets tight. Feels like i cant breathe right. Like im back in the cockpit but i cant reach the controls.",
  "user3": "That sounds intense. Like you're strapped in but powerless.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system4": "In the service you get patched up and sent back out. Broken leg healed in six weeks, back to flying. Cant fix nightmares the same way. Tried ignoring them, didnt work. Tried drinking, made it worse. Amanda keeps saying i need to \"deal with it\" but i dont know how to fix this.",
  "user4": "I hear that. The service taught you healing means getting patched up and sent back. Six weeks for a leg. But nightmares don't work that way.\n\nThird question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system5": "I dont know man. Maybe just... not feeling like im gonna jump out of my skin all the time. Not having Amanda look at me like shes scared of what ill do next. Being able to sit through dinner without getting pissed off about nothing.",
  "user5": "That sounds like basic peace. Not jumping out of your skin. Amanda not looking scared. Getting through dinner without rage.\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system6": "Last month i fixed Sarahs bike. She kept asking me to teach her how, so we spent the afternoon in the garage. She was laughing when the chain finally worked. For like an hour i didnt think about anything else.",
  "user6": "That hour in the garage with Sarah. Teaching her, hearing her laugh when that chain worked. Nothing else existed.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system7": "Maybe i dont need to fix everything. Maybe just... being there for my kids without losing it is enough. I dont know.",
  "user7": "Good. For you, healing means being there for your kids without losing it. That's enough.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system8": "Yeah. Thanks.",
  "user8": "You're welcome.",
  "system9": "Yeah.",
  "user9": "Take care.",
  "system10": "You too.",
  "user10": "Thanks.",
  "system11": "Mm.",
  "user11": "[Quiet acknowledgment]",
  "system12": "Alright.",
  "user12": "Alright.",
  "system13": "Yeah.",
  "user13": "Got it.",
  "system14": "Cool.",
  "user14": "Mm.",
  "system15": "*...*",
  "user15": "[Space]",
  "system16": "...what do you need",
  "user16": "Nothing. Just here.",
  "system17": "Alright.",
  "user17": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\n\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system18": "Look, I just need to know what to pack for Costa Rica and how to not lose my shit when the medicine hits. Thats it.",
  "user18": "I hear you want practical prep for your journey. That's important stuff, but it's not what we're doing here today.\n\nThis is Day 1 of a 54-week integration curriculum. We're covering the foundation - what healing actually means versus fixing.\n\nDifferent resources handle the logistics you're asking about. I'm here for the integration work that comes after.\n\nWant to stay with today's lesson, or do you need to connect with different support for trip planning?",
  "system19": "Yeah I dont need 54 weeks of whatever this is. I need to not wake up screaming and for Amanda to stop looking at me like Im a stranger. \n\nYou got something that actually helps with that or not.",
  "user19": "That sounds brutal. Waking up screaming, Amanda pulling away - that's real pain.\n\nWhat you're describing is exactly why we're here. Not to fix you, but because something in your system is asking to be heard differently.\n\nThe 54 weeks isn't about adding more to your plate. It's about learning to work with what's already happening - the nightmares, the distance with Amanda, the part that feels broken.\n\nYou willing to try one question? Just to see what surfaces?\n\nWhat does healing mean to you right now, in the middle of all this?"
