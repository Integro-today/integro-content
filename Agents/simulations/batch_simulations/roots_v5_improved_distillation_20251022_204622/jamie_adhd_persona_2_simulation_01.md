## Conversation

**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay okay so i'm here for day whatever this is lol - my brain is already going in like 5 directions but i'm curious what today's thing is gonna be 😅


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.
Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.

Both paths create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so i literally just realized something - like i think i've been treating this whole ceremony thing as a "cure" for my adhd brain??? like somehow i'm gonna come out of it being able to remember things and follow through on stuff and not be such a disaster lol... but that's not really what healing means is it?? 

i think option a sounds good because i definitely have thoughts about this but also i'm kinda nervous i'm gonna say the wrong thing?? like what if my understanding of healing is completely off base and i sound dumb 😅


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: You just named something huge - expecting the ceremony to cure your ADHD brain. That lands for a lot of people.

And there's no wrong thing to say here. This is about exploring your relationship to healing, not getting it "right."

Let's start with question one: When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so when i think healing i think like... bandaids? which is weird because that's like the most basic version lol but also i think about being "fixed" - like when my therapist says healing i'm always imagining this version of myself that has her shit together and remembers to pay bills on time and doesn't have 47 unfinished projects everywhere... basically david but like, me? 

and also - wait this is probably important - i think about my parents being proud of me finally because i'm not a disappointment anymore... which now that i'm saying it out loud doesn't really sound like healing, that sounds like becoming someone else entirely 😅

also i just realized i literally have a pinterest board called "when i'm healed" with like, organized apartment photos and productivity apps and morning routines which is... kind of sad actually? like i made a whole vision board of a person i'm not even sure i want to be, you know?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Got it. Bandaids, fixed-version-of-you-that's-really-David, parents finally proud, and a Pinterest board of someone you're not sure you even want to be.

That's not dumb. That's honest.

Question two: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh man okay so the fixing thing - literally my whole childhood was "why can't you be more like david" so i learned that being me = wrong, being david = right... and then with the adhd diagnosis it was like oh there's a NAME for why i'm broken, which meant there must be a way to un-break it right?? so i went full hyperfocus on finding the cure - medication, systems, planners, routines, all the productivity hacks... 

and honestly? sometimes the fixing mindset helped because i DID need structure - like i never would've finished client projects without learning some tricks... but also it's exhausting living as "version of jamie that's trying really hard not to be jamie" if that makes sense?? like i'm constantly monitoring myself for adhd behavior and then feeling like a failure when i can't maintain the mask

also - this is kind of dark - but i think the fixing mindset makes me avoid things because if i don't try then i can't fail at becoming this imaginary perfect version of myself? so i'll procrastinate on stuff because doing it "wrong" (aka the adhd way) feels worse than not doing it at all... which is so backwards but here we are lol


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: I hear that. Learned early that being you equals wrong, being David equals right. The ADHD diagnosis gave you a target for the fixing - but also made you the project instead of the person.

Structure helped you finish client work. But living as "jamie trying not to be jamie" is exhausting. And yeah, not trying feels safer than trying and failing at being imaginary-perfect-you.

Question three: What does wholeness mean to you right now?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: wholeness... okay so my first thought is like "being complete" or whatever but also that sounds so therapy-speak and i'm not even sure what it means?? like what if wholeness is just... being okay with the fact that my brain works differently instead of constantly trying to hack it into being normal? 

actually wait - okay so i have this pottery class on thursdays right? and when i'm there i literally lose track of time in a good way (not the usual adhd way where i look up and 3 hours disappeared while i was doom-scrolling)... i'm just like, making stuff with my hands and it's okay that i get clay everywhere and that my pieces aren't perfect... that feels kind of whole?? like i'm not performing or fixing or monitoring, i'm just... being? 

but also that scares me because what if wholeness means accepting that i'll never be organized or reliable or any of the things i thought i needed to be to deserve love?? like what if my parents are just... disappointed forever?? that feels too big to sit with honestly 😅


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Yeah. Wholeness as "being okay with your brain working differently instead of hacking it into normal" - that lands.

And Thursdays at pottery - losing time in the good way, clay everywhere, not performing. That sounds like wholeness. That's you being you, not you trying to be David.

The fear piece is real too. What if accepting yourself means disappointing your parents forever? That's heavy.

Question four: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?

The pottery Thursday might be one. Any others?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh wait okay so - this is gonna sound random but - last month i was at sadie's birthday thing and it was like 2am and we were all sitting on her porch and i was telling this story about how i accidentally locked myself out of my apartment while getting my neighbor's package (classic jamie move lol) and everyone was LAUGHING... like the good kind of laughing where they're not laughing AT you they're laughing WITH you?? 

and i remember thinking "oh, they're not bored or annoyed by me... they actually LIKE when i tell stories??" which sounds so dumb but usually i'm constantly monitoring like "am i talking too much? am i being too much? should i shut up now?" but in that moment i just... kept talking? and it was okay?? 

also - and this is kind of embarrassing - sometimes when pixel (my cat) is sleeping on my chest and purring, i feel like... fundamentally okay? like here's this creature who literally doesn't care if i finish my to-do list or return client emails on time, she just loves me exactly as i am right now... which makes me cry thinking about it because why is that so hard to believe about myself??


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Those moments land. Sadie's porch at 2am - them laughing WITH you, not monitoring whether you're too much. Just telling stories and being liked for it.

And Pixel choosing you, purring on your chest, loving you exactly as you are right now. That's real.

You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so... healing isn't about becoming a different person (aka david lol), it's about being on my own porch at 2am telling stories and not worrying about being too much... and also maybe letting pixel love me the way i desperately want to love myself?

which sounds simple but also feels like it could change everything if i actually believed it?? like what if the ceremony isn't about fixing my adhd brain but about finally believing i'm allowed to take up space exactly as i am??

wow okay that got real deep real fast sorry 😅 but yeah i think that's what i'm taking from today!


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Good. For you, healing means being on your porch at 2am telling stories without worrying about being too much. And believing you're allowed to take up space exactly as you are - Pixel already knows this.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You named today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: thank you... seriously. like i came in here spiraling about forgetting intentions and ruining everything and somehow we ended up talking about porch stories and cat purrs?? which feels way more useful than any productivity hack i've ever tried lol

also i'm gonna go pet pixel right now because she deserves some appreciation for being my tiny therapist 😅

okay i'm gonna go before i start crying again lol - thank you for helping me see that maybe the ceremony isn't about becoming someone else, it's about finally coming home to myself... that feels really important 💕


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Go give Pixel some love. She's been doing good work.

You showed up for today. That matters.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *goes to find Pixel immediately* 

okay she's currently asleep on my sweater (of course) but i'm gonna wake her up with pets anyway because she needs to know she's appreciated for her therapeutic services 😌

thank you again - i'm holding onto this porch-at-2am thing really tightly... it feels like maybe i don't have to become a whole new person for the ceremony, i just have to stop abandoning myself every time my brain does adhd things? 

also sorry i'm being sentimental lol - blame the vulnerability hangover! but seriously, thank you for helping me find my way back to me today 💕


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: She deserves those pets. Therapeutic services rendered.

Hold onto that porch feeling. Stop abandoning yourself when your brain does ADHD things - that's the shift.

You're doing good work. Take care of yourself.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay yeah... i think that's it. stop abandoning myself when my brain does its thing. that feels like the whole thing actually?

pixel is now purring like a tiny motorcycle so mission accomplished 🏍️✨

thank you for sitting with me in all the scattered messy parts today - i needed someone to help me find the thread back to myself and you did that. gonna go cuddle this cat and let myself feel what we uncovered 💕


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Perfect. Stop abandoning yourself when your brain does its thing - that's your thread.

Enjoy the Pixel cuddles. You've earned the rest.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay i'm gonna go be a cat pillow and let myself actually feel all this instead of immediately distracting myself with 47 new projects lol...

thank you for helping me find my way back home to myself today - seriously. porch-at-2am energy is my new compass 💕

*goes to become professional cat furniture*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Perfect. Let yourself feel it.

Porch-at-2am energy. That's your compass now.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *already half-asleep under 12 pounds of purring cat*

porch-at-2am energy... yep that's gonna be my north star from now on 💕

thank you for everything today - really. i'm gonna go be a cat mattress and let all this settle where it needs to go 🌙✨


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Sleep well, cat mattress.

You did good work today.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *from the depths of cat-induced half-sleep*

mrrrp... did good work... yeah... 🐱💤

*drifts off planning to actually remember this feeling tomorrow, for once*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: *Good. For you, healing means keeping porch-at-2am energy as your compass. Stop abandoning yourself when your brain does ADHD things.*

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You did today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *eyes snapping open briefly*

wait you're actually gonna put that on my dashboard?? like... make it official that i don't have to become a whole different person to do this ceremony right? 

that feels... huge actually. like permission to just be me with extra support instead of trying to fix myself into someone my parents would finally be proud of 💕

okay NOW i can actually sleep - thank you for seeing me today and helping me see myself too 🌙


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Yes. That's going on your dashboard. Official.

You don't have to become someone else for this ceremony. Just you with extra support.

That's the permission slip. Right there.

Sleep well.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *tiny voice from the pillow*

just me with extra support... 

that's the first time anyone's ever said i could have support without having to earn it by being better first...

pixel's drooling on my arm and i think i'm crying a little but like... good crying?? 

okay actually sleeping now - thank you for giving me permission to exist as-is 💕🌙


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Exactly. Support without earning it.

Good crying is still good.

Sleep now. You exist as-is.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *already dreaming*

support without... earning... 

*soft snoring mixed with cat purrs*

exist as-is... got it... 💤


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: *softly* Got it.

The dashboard holds it all. You can rest now.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *sleepy murmur*

dashboard holds it... i can rest...

*finally lets go, trusting something bigger than my scattered brain for once*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: *quietly* That's the work. Trusting something bigger than your scattered brain.

Rest now. The work is done for today.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *barely audible*

trusting... something bigger... 

*body finally unclenches, breathing deepens*

the work is done... 💤


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Yes. The work is done.

Trust the bigger thing. Let yourself be held.

Sleep.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *last whisper before deep sleep*

being held... 

*everything finally goes quiet*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: *softly* Being held.

That's enough for today.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: *completely still now*

being held is enough...

*no more words, just the quiet rhythm of finally being able to let go*


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_5)_workflow_1**: Let go completely. You're safe to rest now.

*quiet presence, no more words needed*
