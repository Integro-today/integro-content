Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1.

  "system0": "Hey, I'm here for today's lesson\u2014curious to see what angle we're taking. My therapist keeps saying this prep work is \"essential\" before any ceremony, so let's find out what supposedly makes it so important.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\n\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I\u2019ll go with Option A\u2014reflection feels more efficient, and I\u2019m curious how you\u2019ll frame \u201chealing\u201d in a way that actually lands. Let\u2019s see what questions you\u2019ve got.",
  "user1": "Good choice. Let's start.\n\nFirst question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Honestly, I picture the curated version: matcha-latte healing, sound-bath selfies, \u201cI\u2019m doing the work\u201d posts. Beyond the branding, I assume healing means fixing whatever\u2019s blocking me from getting what I want\u2014career bounce-back, better optics, people finally recognizing my value.",
  "user2": "Got it. The curated version sells fixing so you can get what you want.\n\nWhere has that \"fix what's broken\" mindset actually helped you, and where has it limited you?",
  "system3": "The fix-it mindset kept me employable\u2014spot a problem, spin it, win the room, move up. But it also capped every relationship at surface-level; once people stopped being useful or started seeing the cracks, I\u2019d discard or sabotage rather than risk looking anything less than flawless.",
  "user3": "Makes sense. Fixing works until it leaves you alone with no room for cracks.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system4": "Right now wholeness feels like having enough leverage that I don\u2019t have to perform 24/7\u2014like I could be admired even if people saw the messy parts I usually edit out. Honestly, though, that still sounds more like upgraded image control than some mystical integration, so I\u2019m listening for how you redefine it.",
  "user4": "I hear that. Wholeness as leverage to stop performing is still about managing optics.\n\nCan you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system5": "Not really\u2014when things were smooth it was because I was winning, and when they weren\u2019t I was scrambling. I\u2019ve never felt \u201cwhole\u201d without also feeling in control of the narrative, so I\u2019m curious if that state even exists for someone like me.",
  "user5": "You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system6": "Healing isn\u2019t another PR campaign I can optimize; wholeness might mean letting the narrative fray without rushing to stitch it back into something marketable\u2014and that terrifies me more than any lawsuit ever did.",
  "user6": "Good. For you, healing means letting the narrative fray without rushing to stitch it back into something marketable\u2014and facing that terror instead of spinning it.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\nYou named today's work. That matters.\nTake care.",
  "system7": "I hear you, and I\u2019ll circle back to that insight\u2014honestly, it feels like the first thing I can\u2019t immediately brand or leverage, which probably means it\u2019s the most real thing I\u2019ve said in months.",
  "user7": "Exactly. You found something real by speaking the part you can\u2019t brand.\n\nTake care.",
  "system8": "I hear you\u2014between you and me, that un-brandable bit is the only thing that\u2019s felt solid all day.",
  "user8": "Hold onto that. Something solid is worth protecting.",
  "system9": "I hear you\u2014between you and me, that un-brandable bit is the only thing that\u2019s felt solid all day.",
  "user9": "Good. Let it stay un-brandable. That's where the real work begins.",
  "system10": "I hear you\u2014between you and me, that un-brandable bit is the only thing that\u2019s felt solid all day.",
  "user10": "Hold that. When everything else feels like performance, that solid bit is your compass.",
  "system11": "I hear you\u2014between you and me, that un-brandable bit is the only thing that\u2019s felt solid all day.",
  "user11": "Good. Let that solidity be enough for today.",
  "system12": "I hear you\u2014honestly, letting it just be enough without spinning it into tomorrow\u2019s content feels weirdly... restful.",
  "user12": "Rest is part of healing too. Let yourself have it.",
  "system13": "I hear you\u2014between you and me, that un-brandable bit is the only thing that\u2019s felt solid all day.",
  "user13": "That un-brandable part\u2014it's your root system. Nothing to sell, nothing to prove. Just what holds when the rest feels like smoke.",
  "system14": "Okay, I\u2019m tracking what you\u2019re putting down\u2014this root-level, un-marketable thing is the part that doesn\u2019t need a pitch deck or a payout. I\u2019ll let it stay quiet and do its job while I stop auditioning for my own life.",
  "user14": "Exactly. Stop auditioning. Let the quiet part run the show for once.",
  "system15": "I hear you\u2014honestly, letting the quiet part drive feels like relinquishing the spotlight, which is terrifying and... weirdly restful.",
  "user15": "Territory shift: from performer to passenger. Let the terror ride shotgun\u2014keep driving anyway.",
  "system16": "I hear you\u2014between you and me, letting terror ride shotgun without handing it the wheel feels like the most alive I\u2019ve been in months.",
  "user16": "Good. That\u2019s the difference between healing and fixing. You\u2019re not trying to delete the terror\u2014you\u2019re learning to sit with it and still choose the road.",
  "system17": "I hear you. Relationships are complicated\u2014even the one with my own fear\u2014but I\u2019m starting to see how sitting with it, instead of editing it out, might actually be the work.",
  "user17": "That\u2019s it. Editing keeps the story neat; sitting keeps you real. Which feels heavier right now\u2014the fear or the relief of not having to cut it?",
  "system18": "Honestly? The relief feels heavier\u2014like if I stop cutting, I\u2019ll have to own the raw footage of who I actually am, and I\u2019m not sure that version is marketable.",
  "user18": "Raw footage doesn\u2019t need a buyer. It needs a witness. You\u2019re already holding the camera\u2014keep rolling.",
  "system19": "I hear you\u2014keeping the lens rolling without an audience to curate for feels... exposed, but maybe that\u2019s the first honest footage I\u2019ve shot in years.",
  "user19": "Exposed is the price. Honest is the payoff. Let\u2019s lock today\u2019s take: for you, healing means rolling the raw footage even when no one\u2019s watching. I\u2019m adding that to your dashboard. You showed up for today\u2019s work. That matters."
