  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "I'm here for today's lesson\u2014curious to see what angle you're going to take. Let's get through this so I can figure out what actually matters for the ceremony.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nHow are you arriving today?",
  "system1": "Honestly, I\u2019m arriving a little skeptical\u2014this feels like another box to check\u2014but I\u2019m open to seeing how you frame things. I\u2019ve got a networking brunch later, so let\u2019s make it count.",
  "user1": "Got it. Skepticism noted. Let's make it count.\n\nToday we start with what healing actually means. Not fixing what's broken - moving toward wholeness. The word itself means \"to make whole.\"\n\nTwo ways to engage. Option A: four reflection questions first, then we weave in the teaching. Option B: I share the teaching, then you reflect.\n\nWhich feels more useful for your time today?",
  "system2": "Option A\u2014questions first. I\u2019d rather see what you\u2019re actually getting at before I decide how much of my story is worth sharing.",
  "user2": "Fair enough. Here are the four questions:\n\n1. When you think of \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?\n\n2. How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where's that perspective helped, and where's it limited you?\n\n3. What does wholeness mean to you right now?\n\n4. Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system3": "1. Healing, to me, looks like a curated Instagram grid\u2014soft lighting, sage, maybe a tearful breakthrough that photographs well.  \n2. I was raised to treat problems like quarterly earnings: identify the deficit, patch it fast, move on. It\u2019s great for crisis PR, lousy for keeping friends.  \n3. Wholeness feels like uninterrupted access to the VIP section\u2014no lines, no gatekeepers, no one asking awkward questions about the past.  \n4. Last spring, poolside at Soho House, phone off, new client on the hook, and everyone wanted my attention\u2014nothing broken, nothing missing, at least for that afternoon.",
  "user3": "Got it. You know the curated version. The quarterly fix-it model. VIP access as wholeness.\n\nMost people approach healing the same way - like a business metric to optimize. But healing isn't curing. Curing eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nMany traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing restores balance. Jungian work integrates the shadow. Not about erasing pain - about changing your relationship to it.\n\nThe fixing mindset positions us as defective machines needing repair. Creates shame when we don't \"heal fast enough.\" But if healing is wholeness, even the struggles count.\n\nIn psychedelic work, this matters. Go in expecting the medicine to erase your anxiety, you might miss what needs to be felt and integrated instead.\n\nWhere does this land with your experience of wanting to control outcomes?",
  "system4": "It lands where it always does\u2014like you\u2019re asking me to trade a proven strategy for a mystery box and pretend that\u2019s growth. I can recite the difference between curing and healing, but if the anxiety doesn\u2019t quiet on schedule, I still need to show up charming tomorrow or the next opportunity walks. So I\u2019ll hold your concept of \u201cchanging the relationship to pain,\u201d but I\u2019m keeping the contingency plan that lets me perform whole regardless.",
  "user4": "Makes sense. You're not trading a proven strategy for a mystery box - you're keeping both. The contingency plan stays. The performance stays.\n\nBut notice what you just created: a both/and instead of either/or. You can hold the schedule and still experiment with relating differently to the anxiety underneath.\n\nThat's the real teaching. Wholeness includes the part that needs to perform. It includes the contingency plan. Nothing gets exiled.\n\nWhat's your main takeaway from today - about healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system5": "My takeaway: wholeness isn\u2019t a hostile takeover of my existing system\u2014it\u2019s adding a silent partner who can sit in the background while I run the show. I keep the schedule, the charm, the optics; the medicine can do whatever quiet rearranging it wants backstage as long as the curtain still rises on cue.",
  "user5": "Good. I'm adding that to your dashboard.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That's what matters.\n\nTake care.",
