  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Alright, let\u2019s see what today\u2019s lesson is\u2014though I\u2019ll probably end up analyzing it instead of actually *doing* it, so\u2026 consider this my preemptive apology for that.",
  "user0": "Got it. No apology needed.\n\nWelcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nHow are you arriving today?",
  "system1": "I\u2019m arriving\u2026 caffeinated, mildly anxious, and already in my head about how to \u201cproperly\u201d answer a question as simple as \u201chow are you?\u201d Which, honestly, probably tells you everything you need to know about how I\u2019m arriving.",
  "user1": "Sounds like you're arriving exactly how you are - and that's data, not a problem.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Four reflection questions first, then I'll weave in the teaching as we go.\n\nOption B: I share the teaching content first, then you reflect on what landed.\n\nEither way, we'll create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "system2": "Option A, I think\u2014if I start with the teaching I\u2019ll just intellectualize it into a framework instead of noticing what actually resonates. Questions first might keep me in the room with myself for thirty seconds before the analysis kicks in.",
  "user2": "Good call.\n\nFour questions. Answer what you can, skip what doesn't fit. I'll follow your lead.\n\n1. When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come up?\n\nJust start where you are.",
  "system3": "Healing, for me, immediately conjures this tidy, almost clinical image\u2014like a neat row of stitches after surgery, or a client\u2019s DSM checklist with every symptom trending down. I assume it means \u201cless symptomatic,\u201d \u201cmore functional,\u201d \u201cback to baseline,\u201d which I know is my Type-1 perfectionist brain defaulting to measurable outcomes. There\u2019s also this quiet background assumption that if I just find the right protocol\u201427 years of trying pretty much everything\u2014there\u2019ll be a moment where I\u2019m finally \u201cdone,\u201d like crossing a finish line\u2026 instead of what it actually feels like: a perpetual literature review on myself that never reaches a final edition.",
  "user3": "Sounds like healing shows up as a spreadsheet that never quite balances.\n\n2. How has life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that view helped, and where has it limited you?",
  "system4": "Therapy training drilled the \u201cpresenting problem \u2192 treatment plan \u2192 measurable goals\u201d pipeline into me, so I default to seeing healing as a series of correctable errors\u2014like emotional bug-fixes. That view\u2019s helped me stay organized for clients: track trauma symptoms, choose evidence-based interventions, celebrate when their PHQ-9 drops. Personally, though, it\u2019s turned my life into a permanent performance-improvement project; every anxious morning becomes another KPI I\u2019ve failed to optimize. Instead of experiencing grief or loneliness, I\u2019m hunting the \u201cright\u201d technique to eliminate them\u2014so the feeling itself never gets metabolized, just audited.",
  "user4": "Helpful for clients, exhausting for you. Like using a calculator to measure your own heartbeat.\n\n3. What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system5": "Right now wholeness feels like the opposite of compartmentalization\u2014no \u201ctherapist part\u201d running the show while the rest of me stays locked out, no splitting off body from intellect or Self from symptoms. It\u2019s the sense that I could sit in my apartment on a random Tuesday night, feel the ache of loneliness in my chest, and not immediately reach for a theory to explain it away or a task to fix it; just let the ache belong without trying to edit it out of the narrative. A quiet, embodied \u201cand\u201d instead of an endless string of \u201cbuts\u201d and footnotes.",
  "user5": "An embodied \"and\" instead of footnotes. That lands.\n\n4. Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system6": "Two summers ago I got caught in a thunderstorm on my walk home\u2014no umbrella, soaked in about thirty seconds. Instead of catastrophizing or checking the weather app for validation, I started laughing, this totally involuntary, full-belly sound. For maybe a minute there was no observer stance, no internal case report\u2014just cold rain, warm skin, and the smell of asphalt. I was still lonely, still anxious, still Rebecca, but every compartment dropped offline at once and the sensations owned the whole field. I remember thinking, \u201cOh, this is what presence tastes like when no one\u2019s grading it.\u201d",
  "user6": "Cold rain, warm skin, and no one grading it. That's the thread.\n\nLet me weave in the teaching now. Most people approach healing like fixing broken machinery - eliminate symptoms, hit metrics, declare victory. But healing literally means \"to make whole.\" Not perfect, not symptom-free. Whole.\n\nYou already tasted that in the thunderstorm. Challenges present, compartments gone, everything belonging.\n\nNotice how that contrasts with your default fixing mode. Same you, different relationship.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system7": "Healing isn\u2019t a performance-improvement plan I can spreadsheet into submission; it\u2019s the moment I let every row and column dissolve into the lived ache or laughter that\u2019s already here. If I stop auditing my experience, maybe the thunderstorm version of me\u2014where nothing needs correcting\u2014gets to stay in the room longer than sixty seconds.",
  "user7": "Got it. I'm adding that to your dashboard.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system8": "Thanks\u2014really. I\u2019ll carry the dashboard reminder that presence doesn\u2019t need footnotes, only permission. See you next time.",
  "user8": "Permission without footnotes. Hold that.\n\nSee you next time.",
  "system9": "I\u2019ll hold it\u2014no bullet points, no annotations. Just permission.",
  "user9": "Good. You did today\u2019s work. That\u2019s enough.\n\nTake care.",
  "system10": "Got it. Permission without footnotes\u2014holding it.",
  "user10": "Holding it without footnotes. That's the practice.\n\nSee you next time.",
  "system11": "Holding it, no footnotes. See you next time.",
  "user11": "See you next time.",
  "system12": "See you next time.",
  "user12": "See you next time.",
  "system13": "See you next time.",

  "user18": "See you next time.",
  "system19": "Okay... I think we've looped into some kind of goodbye spiral here. \n\nActually, this reminds me of what I do with clients sometimes\u2014when things get uncomfortable or we're approaching something vulnerable, I deflect with competence or repetition. It's like we're both avoiding something by saying \"see you next time\" over and over. \n\nI mean, if you actually need to go, that's fine. But if you're still here... maybe we could talk about what just happened? Does that make sense, or am I overanalyzing a simple goodbye?",
  "user19": "You're noticing the pattern. That's sharp.\n\nSometimes the loop *is* the work. The mind grabs something safe\u2014like a goodbye\u2014and rides it to avoid what's underneath. You caught it. That matters.\n\nWhat feels risky about staying in this moment?"
