  "system0": "Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Headed to Costa Rica in three weeks. Amanda thinks this'll help. I dont know.",
  "user0": "Got it. Big transition coming up.\n\nThree weeks isn't much time to prepare your foundations. What feels uncertain right now - the journey itself, or what comes after?",
  "system1": "Everything. Dont know what to expect from some plant ceremony. Dont know if Ill come back worse. Mostly scared Amanda will leave even if it does work.",
  "user1": "That sounds heavy. You're facing the unknown with your relationship on the line.\n\nThe fear of coming back \"worse\" - that's real. Most people worry about that. What does Amanda think will be different if this helps?",
  "system2": "Says maybe Ill stop waking up screaming. Maybe I wont jump when doors slam. Maybe we can have dinner without me snapping at the kids. Says she misses who I used to be before... before I got like this.",
  "user2": "Sounds like Amanda's holding onto hope that the man she knows is still in there, buried under whatever happened.\n\nThe screaming, jumping, snapping - that's your nervous system stuck on high alert. Your body trying to protect you, even when the danger's gone.\n\nWhat happened that changed who you used to be?",
  "system3": "I dont want to talk about that. Its just... missions. Stuff that happened over there. Doesnt matter now anyway.",
  "user3": "Got it. Whatever happened over there lives in your body now. That's what matters.\n\nThe ceremony isn't about reliving those missions. It's about helping your nervous system learn the war is over. That safe dinner tables aren't combat zones.\n\nWhat's your biggest fear about the plant medicine itself?",
  "system4": "Losing control. What if I see things I cant handle. What if I break down and cant pull myself together. In the cockpit I always had to stay sharp. This... this feels like jumping without a parachute.",
  "user4": "You're used to being the one in control, keeping everyone alive. Now you're being asked to surrender that control to a plant.\n\nThe cockpit kept you sharp because you had to be. But this isn't combat - you don't need to stay sharp here. You need to let go.\n\nWhat if breaking down is exactly what needs to happen? What if the pieces that need to come apart are the ones keeping you stuck in combat mode?\n\nWho would you be without that constant vigilance?",
  "system5": "I dont know. Dont remember who I was before always being... like this. Maybe just some guy who can sit through dinner without scanning the room. Who doesnt wake up choking on his own breath. I guess thats what Amanda wants back.",
  "user5": "That guy who could just sit through dinner - he's still in there. He's just been hiding behind all that vigilance, trying to keep you safe.\n\nThe ceremony might show you that version of yourself again. Not because the plant fixes you, but because it helps you remember who you were before survival became your full-time job.\n\nWhat would it feel like to give Amanda back that man she misses?",
  "system6": "Like maybe I could breathe again too. Maybe stop feeling this weight on my chest all the time. But what if that guys gone for good? What if I go through all this and still come back... broken?",
  "user6": "The weight on your chest - that's your body still carrying the war. It's not about fixing what's broken. It's about remembering you were whole before this happened.\n\nThat guy you were? He's not gone. He's just buried under years of survival. The ceremony doesn't create a new you - it helps uncover who you already are underneath all this.\n\nWhat if coming back \"broken\" is actually coming back more whole than you've felt in years?",
  "system7": "I guess... I guess thats what Im hoping for. That maybe I can get back to being someone Amanda doesnt have to worry about. Someone my kids arent scared of. Just dont know if its possible anymore.",
  "user7": "Amanda's not scared of you - she's scared *for* you. There's a difference. Your kids aren't scared of who you are, they're scared of who the war made you become.\n\nThe ceremony isn't about becoming someone new. It's about becoming someone you used to know. Someone who could breathe without checking for threats. Someone who could sit at dinner without planning escape routes.\n\nWhat would you say to that version of yourself if you could find him again?",
  "system8": "Id say... id say Im sorry. For letting it get this bad. For not knowing how to come back to you guys. I dont know man. Just feels like Im so far gone from who I used to be.",
  "user8": "You're not far gone. You're right here, talking about coming home to your family. That's not someone who's lost - that's someone who remembers what matters.\n\nThe \"sorry\" you're carrying - that's war talking, not truth. You didn't let anything get bad. You did what you had to do to survive. Now you're doing what you need to do to live again.\n\nWhat if Amanda and your kids aren't waiting for you to be who you used to be? What if they're just waiting for you to be present with them, however you show up?",
  "system9": "I guess... I guess they just want me to be there. Really be there. Not sitting at dinner thinking about something that happened 15 years ago. Not checking the exits every time we go out to eat. Just... be their dad. Be Amandas husband. Not some ghost walking around in my own life.",
  "user9": "That's it. That's the whole thing. Not being perfect - just being *there*. Present enough to hear your daughter's laugh without flinching. Still enough to see Amanda's smile when she looks at you.\n\nThe ghost walking through your life - that's what the ceremony can help lay to rest. Not by erasing what happened, but by helping you stop living in two places at once.\n\nWhat would it feel like to sit through one whole dinner without leaving the table in your mind?",
  "system10": "Like maybe I could finally exhale. Like I wouldnt have to pretend to listen while Im actually counting exits and faces. Maybe I could just... eat. Talk to my kids about school. Ask Amanda about her day. Feel normal for once.",
  "user10": "There's the truth. You want normal more than you want perfect. Just one meal where you're not doing two jobs at once - being their dad and being security.\n\nThe ceremony might show you that normal isn't something you have to become. It's something you already are, underneath all that vigilance. You don't need to learn to be normal - you need to remember how to stop being at war.\n\nWhen was the last time you felt normal, even for a minute?",
  "system11": "Last week. Sarah was showing me this drawing she did at school. Just some rainbow thing. I was actually looking at it, not thinking about anything else. Then she said \"youre really looking Daddy\" and I realized... I wasnt scanning the room or anything. Just looking at her picture. Lasted maybe thirty seconds but... yeah.",
  "user11": "Thirty seconds of being Sarah's dad looking at her rainbow. That's not nothing - that's everything. That's the whole thing right there.\n\nYou already know how to do this. You proved it in that moment. The ceremony doesn't teach you something new - it helps you find more of those thirty-second windows. Helps them stretch longer.\n\nWhat if healing isn't about becoming someone you're not, but about having more moments where you're exactly who Sarah saw in that instant?",
  "system12": "I guess... I guess if I could have more of those moments, maybe I wouldnt feel like such a stranger in my own house. Like Im always pretending to be their dad instead of just being him.",
  "user12": "You weren't pretending in that thirty seconds. You were being him. The real dad Sarah recognized.\n\nFeeling like a stranger in your own house - that's the war talking. But Sarah saw through it. She saw you. Not the soldier, not the ghost - her dad, really looking at her rainbow.\n\nWhat would it mean to trust that Sarah's right about who you really are?",
  "system13": "That maybe Im not as far gone as I think. That maybe she sees something I cant see anymore. Something Amanda still sees too, or she wouldve left already. I dont know man. Its hard to believe them when all I feel is broken.",
  "user13": "Sarah and Amanda aren't waiting for you to stop being broken. They're seeing what's still whole underneath. That's why they're still here.\n\nBroken and whole aren't opposites - they coexist. The ceremony doesn't fix what's broken. It helps you notice the wholeness that never left, even when everything felt shattered.\n\nYour daughter spotted it in thirty seconds. Your wife sees it every day. What if they're not wrong about you?",
  "system14": "Then maybe... maybe I got something worth fighting for. Not just something to run from. Maybe thats why Im doing this whole plant medicine thing. Not cause I believe in it, but cause they believe in me.",
  "user14": "There it is. Not belief in the medicine - belief in *them*. In Sarah's thirty-second sight. In Amanda choosing to stay. In what they see that you can't yet.\n\nThat's worth fighting for. That's worth sitting through whatever the ceremony shows you.\n\nWhat do you think they see that you don't?",
  "system15": "I dont know man. Maybe they see the guy who used to laugh at stupid jokes and play catch in the yard. The guy who could sit through a whole movie without jumping. Someone who wasnt always waiting for the other shoe to drop. They remember him, even if I dont.",
  "user15": "They remember him because he's not gone - he's just buried under all that vigilance. Like he's wearing the soldier's uniform so tight he forgot there was a person underneath.\n\nThe guy who laughed at stupid jokes might be quieter now, harder to hear over the noise in your head. But Sarah spotted him in thirty seconds. Amanda sees him when she chooses to stay.\n\nWhat if the ceremony isn't about bringing back some perfect version of who you were? What if it's about meeting that guy where he is now - uniform and all - and discovering he's still got laughter in him?\n\nStill think he's worth finding?",
  "system16": "Yeah. Yeah I do. Even if I dont know how to find him. Even if it scares the hell out of me, what I might see or remember. But if they can still see him... maybe hes worth sitting through whatever this ceremony shows me.",
  "user16": "That's your compass right there. Not the fear - the *why* behind facing it. Sarah and Amanda can see him, so you're willing to sit through whatever shows up to find him again.\n\nThe ceremony will show you things. Some beautiful, some brutal. But now you know why you're looking - not to fix what's broken, but to find what's still whole underneath.\n\nYou've got something worth sitting for. That's different from being ready. Ready is a myth. Worth it is real.\n\nWhat do you want to remember about this conversation when you're in it?",
  "system17": "That Im not doing this for me. Im doing it for them. For Sarah and her rainbow and those thirty seconds. That even when it gets hard or scary, I got people waiting for me to come back. People who never stopped seeing who I really am, even when I couldnt.",
  "user17": "That's your anchor. Sarah's rainbow. Amanda choosing to stay. The thirty seconds when you weren't pretending - you were being him.\n\nWhen it gets hard, come back to that. When it gets scary, remember why you're sitting there. Not to fix yourself, but to find the guy they've been seeing all along.\n\nYou ready to carry that into tomorrow?",
  "system18": "Yeah. I am. Gonna be a long few weeks but I can hold onto this. Got something real to carry with me now.",
  "user18": "Good. You've got something real now. Not just the weight of what needs fixing - the pull of who's waiting for you to come home.\n\nLong few weeks ahead, but you're not carrying this alone. They never stopped seeing you.",
  "system19": "Yeah. Thanks for that. Makes it feel less like Im just going through the motions. Like theres actually a point to all this.",
  "user19": "Got it. There's a point now - not just going through motions, but going *toward* something. Toward the guy Sarah spotted in thirty seconds.\n\nThat's worth carrying into what's ahead."
