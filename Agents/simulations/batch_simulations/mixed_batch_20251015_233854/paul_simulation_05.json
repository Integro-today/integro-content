  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I got into Heroic Hearts. Three weeks, Costa Rica. Never done anything like this before.\n\nAmanda\u2014my wife\u2014she says I need to do something. Nightmares got worse, I'm snapping at the kids. Don't want to lose her. Don't want to mess up what we built.\n\nI don't buy into all this plant medicine stuff. But the guys at Heroic Hearts, they're solid. Veterans. They say it works. Figure it's worth a shot.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without nightmares\n2. Stop snapping at the kids\n3. Keep Amanda\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That's about right.\n\nI just want to sleep through the night without waking up drenched, feeling like I'm back there. Want to sit at dinner without this... anger just sitting under everything. And Amanda... she deserves better than what I'm giving her.\n\nI don't know how to say it right. Just want to be the man she married. The dad my kids think I am.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I sit with my family without anger underneath\n3. I show up as the man Amanda married\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one. Sleep. If I could just sleep...\n\nBut \"peacefully\" sounds... I don't know. Too soft. Like I'm some kind of victim. I'm not broken, I just need my brain to shut up at night.\n\nHow about: \"I sleep through the night without the past running the show.\"\n\nThat work?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep through the night without the past running the show\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The anger one... \"sit with my family without anger underneath\" - that's true, but it's missing something. It's not just sitting there. It's... I want to feel connected to them again. Instead of feeling like I'm watching from behind glass.\n\nAnd the Amanda one... \"show up as the man she married\" - that's what I want, but what if that guy's gone? What if I can't get back to being him?\n\nI don't know. Maybe... \"I feel connected to my family instead of watching from the outside\"?\n\nAnd \"I become someone Amanda can trust with her heart again\"?\n\nToo much?",
  "system4": "Not too much. Real.\n\nBased on your adjustments:\n\n2. I feel connected to my family instead of watching from the outside\n3. I become someone Amanda can trust with her heart again\n\nThese feel right?",
  "user4": "Yeah. They do.\n\nThird one's hard to say out loud, but... it's true. She used to look at me like I was her safe place. Now she looks at me like she's bracing for whatever's coming next.\n\nThese feel right. Just hope this plant stuff actually works.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the past running the show\n2. I feel connected to my family instead of watching from the outside  \n3. I become someone Amanda can trust with her heart again\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate it.",
  "system6": "Good. That wallet's carried you through a lot - let it carry these too.\n\nTrust the process. The medicine knows what to do with what you're bringing.",
  "user6": "It's carried me through a lot of places I didn't want to be, that's for sure.\n\nGuess we'll see what happens in a few weeks. Just ready to get there and do this thing.",
  "system7": "You'll be ready when you get there. The work starts now - these intentions are already doing their job.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user7": "Yeah. Alright.\n\nI'll... I'll try to remember that.",
  "system8": "That's all you need.",
  "user8": "Alright then. I'm good to go.",
  "system9": "Solid.",
  "user9": "Yeah.",

  "user16": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts thinks this plant stuff might help me sleep better, stop the nightmares. Here I am. Can't keep going like this\u2014Amanda's barely sleeping either, jumps every time I shout in my sleep.",

  "user18": "The second one. I need to... I need to stop making her afraid in her own house. That's the one that gets me. She's looking at me different lately, like she don't know who I am when I'm shouting.",

  "user19": "They're good. The first one... I don't know if I believe I can actually sleep through the night, but I want to. The third one... yeah. I want to wake up here, not there."
