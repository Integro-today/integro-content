  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts set this up - said it might help with... some stuff. My wife Amanda, she's... we're having problems. My kids... I just need to figure out how to sleep without waking up the whole damn house. \n\nThree weeks till Costa Rica. Never done anything like this before. Don't even know what I'm supposed to want from it.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep without waking Amanda and the kids\n2. Find clarity on what you need for your marriage\n3. Trust this first journey when you don't know what to expect\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "I... I don't know how to say this stuff right. The sleep thing - that's real. Amanda says I scare her when I wake up shouting. Hate that I'm doing that to her.\n\nThe marriage part... we've been together since college. Built everything together. Now she looks at me like I'm a stranger sometimes. I don't know how to fix that.\n\nAnd trusting this? [pauses] I don't believe in any of this plant medicine stuff. But those Heroic Hearts guys - they served, they get it. If they say it helped them... maybe there's something to it.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully beside Amanda\n2. I reconnect with the woman who built everything with me\n3. I trust what these veterans are showing me about healing\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I sleep peacefully beside Amanda\" - that hits hard. That's what I want most, I think. To just... not wake up fighting something that isn't there.\n\nThe second one... \"reconnect with the woman who built everything with me\" - that sounds right too. She didn't marry some guy who jumps at loud noises and can't sit through a fireworks show without sweating.\n\nThe third... I don't know. \"Trust what these veterans are showing me about healing\" - I want to say yes to that, but part of me feels like I'm admitting something's broken. And I don't know if I can trust it. Not really.\n\nCan we... can we keep the first two and maybe work on the third one? Make it less about trusting them and more about... I don't know. Being open to whatever this is?",
  "system3": "1. I sleep peacefully beside Amanda\n2. I reconnect with the woman who built everything with me  \n3. I stay open to whatever this medicine shows me\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "Yeah... yeah, that third one feels better. \"I stay open to whatever this medicine shows me\" - I can do that. It's not about trusting some magic plant. It's just... not fighting it when it happens.\n\nThe first two... [long pause] those feel like they're pulling at something in my chest. Like they know exactly what I want but I'm scared to admit it out loud.\n\nI keep thinking about Afghanistan nights. Flying missions, coming back to base, trying to sleep in those damn bunks. I'd give anything to just... lie down next to Amanda and not feel like I'm still over there.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully beside Amanda\n2. I reconnect with the woman who built everything with me\n3. I stay open to whatever this medicine shows me\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Got it. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet - been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks for... helping me put words to this. I don't know what'll happen in Costa Rica, but at least now I've got something to hold onto. Something real.\n\nTell Amanda I'm trying. That's all I got right now.",
  "system5": "You got something real to hold onto now. That's enough to start.\n\nThe trying counts. The medicine will meet you there.",
  "user5": "Yeah... trying's about all I know how to do anymore. \n\nAppreciate you walking me through this. Three weeks feels like forever and nothing at the same time. But I've got these now. That's... that's something.",
  "system6": "Three weeks is time to get ready. You've got your compass.\n\nKeep showing up. That's all any of us can do.",
  "user6": "Keep showing up. Yeah, I can do that. Been doing that my whole life.\n\nThanks. I'll... I'll see this through.",
  "system7": "You know how to show up. That's your strength.\n\nSee it through.",
  "user7": "Yeah. See it through.",
  "system8": "You've got this.",
  "user8": "We\u2019ll find out.",
  "system9": "That's the truth of it. Trust what finds you.",
  "user9": "I'll try to remember that when I'm down there. When whatever's gonna find me... finds me.",
  "system10": "When it finds you, just breathe and stay open. The trying is enough.",
  "user10": "Breathe and stay open. Right. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna come up. Could be the missions, the guys we lost, Amanda\u2019s face when I wake up yelling\u2026 but I won\u2019t run from it. Not this time.",
  "system11": "Good. Face it straight. That's how the medicine works.",
  "user11": "Straight on. Like a damn missile lock.",
  "system12": "Exactly. Lock on. Let it come.",
  "user12": "Locked. Letting it come.",
  "system13": "You're ready.",
  "user13": "Ready as I\u2019ll ever be.",
  "system14": "That's all you need.",
  "user14": "Then that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.",
  "system15": "Good. Take it in.",
  "user15": "Taking it in.",
  "system16": "Solid.",
  "user16": "Yeah.",
  "system17": "You're set.",
  "user17": "I'm set.",
  "system18": "Go.",
  "user18": "Going.",
  "system19": "Trust what comes.",
  "user19": "Trust it."
