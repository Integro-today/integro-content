  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I guess... I don't know if I'm doing this right. I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and my last few experiences\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, those women's retreats\u2014they've all shown me something I'm missing. Something about connection, about meaning beyond the board meetings and the exits and the next big thing.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother, how she prayed every morning with such conviction. And here I am, waking up at 5:30, checking my portfolio before I even meditate. If I meditate at all. There's this gap between who I am in ceremony and who I am when I'm back home with David and the kids. I want to bridge that. I need to bridge that.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Bridging the gap between ceremony self and daily life\n2. Finding meaning beyond achievements and board meetings  \n3. Reconnecting with your grandmother's grounded faith\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those three, they feel right. Like that's exactly what's been pulling at me. \n\nThe hardest part is I keep having these profound experiences where I feel so connected to something bigger, so clear about what matters. Then I'm back in my kitchen, yelling at Maya about her homework while I'm on a call about quarterly projections. It's like I'm two different people and I can't figure out how to hold onto that wiser version of myself when real life hits.\n\nMy grandmother would have these simple rituals\u2014lighting candles, saying prayers, helping neighbors. Nothing fancy, but she moved through the world with this quiet certainty. I want that. Not the religion necessarily, but the... I don't know... the way she carried meaning in her bones while I'm still chasing it like it's another acquisition.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I embody my ceremony self in daily moments with Maya and David\n2. I find meaning in simple rituals beyond achievements\n3. I carry my grandmother's quiet certainty in my bones\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one... that one hits something deep. \"I embody my ceremony self in daily moments with Maya and David.\" It's specific. Real. I can picture it\u2014being that version of myself who knows what matters when Maya's frustrated about fractions or David's venting about work.\n\nThe second one feels too soft. \"Simple rituals\" sounds like something I'd read in a wellness magazine. My grandmother's faith wasn't simple\u2014it was fierce. Quiet but unshakeable. She survived the war, built a life from nothing, raised four kids while working in a garment factory. There's got to be a stronger way to say that.\n\nAnd that third one... I want that certainty in my bones, but I don't even know what that feels like yet. It's like I'm asking to become someone I'm not even sure I can be.",
  "system3": "How about:\n2. I reclaim fierce meaning beyond boardroom battles\n3. I grow my grandmother's unshakeable faith in my own bones\n\nHow do these feel?",
  "user3": "Reclaim... that word feels powerful. Like something I lost that I'm taking back. And \"fierce meaning\" - yes, that's better than simple rituals. My grandmother was fierce in her quiet way. She'd look you right in the eye and you'd feel her strength.\n\nThe third one still feels... I don't know. Like I'm trying too hard to be something I'm not. Maybe it's the \"grow\" part? Or maybe I just can't picture myself with that kind of certainty yet. \n\nWhen I think about these intentions, I want them to feel like I'm building a bridge back to something real. Not performing another role, you know? I've spent my whole life being who I needed to be to succeed. This time I want to find out who I actually am when I'm not trying to win at something.",
  "system4": "Let's try:\n3. I discover who I am beyond performance\n\nNow we have:\n1. I embody my ceremony self in daily moments with Maya and David\n2. I reclaim fierce meaning beyond boardroom battles  \n3. I discover who I am beyond performance\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user4": "Yes. These feel... honest. Like they're pointing to something real instead of another thing I'm supposed to achieve.\n\nThat third one especially. \"I discover who I am beyond performance.\" It makes my chest tight in a good way. Like maybe there's actually someone underneath all this striving who just wants to be quiet sometimes. Who doesn't need to have the right answer or the next big idea.\n\nI think about those moments with my kids at the park, when I'm not checking my phone, when I'm just... there. Pushing them on the swings, feeling the sun. I'm not Ellen the entrepreneur or Ellen the board member. I'm just... mom. That's probably the closest I get to my ceremony self in real life.\n\nThese feel like they could actually guide me. Like if I get lost in the ibogaine space, I can come back to these three things and remember what I'm really looking for.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I embody my ceremony self in daily moments with Maya and David\n2. I reclaim fierce meaning beyond boardroom battles\n3. I discover who I am beyond performance\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them daily.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Thank you. I'll write them down\u2014maybe keep them in my wallet next to that photo of the kids from our hike last spring. That feels right.\n\nI... I don't know what I'm walking into with ibogaine, but having these three things to hold onto makes it feel less like jumping off a cliff and more like... I don't know. Like maybe I have a thread to follow back to myself, whatever happens out there.\n\nI appreciate you helping me find the words for what I've been feeling but couldn't quite name.",
  "system6": "That photo sounds perfect. A good reminder of who you're really doing this for.\n\nThe medicine works even when you forget the intentions completely. But having them gives you something to return to. That's enough.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user6": "Yeah... that photo. The kids are muddy and grinning like maniacs, and I remember thinking in that moment that I was exactly where I was supposed to be. No achievements, no board meetings\u2014just us and some trail mix and too many questions about bugs.\n\nI'll trust the process. Even when it gets dark or confusing or I want to run back to what's familiar. Especially then.\n\nThank you for holding space for this. For not letting me make it into another project to optimize.",
  "system7": "That muddy moment - that's your thread back. When it gets hard, remember their grins.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user7": "Their muddy grins... yeah. That's it exactly.\n\nOkay. I'm ready.",
  "system8": "Solid compass.",
  "user8": "*Solid compass.*",
  "system9": "*Solid compass.*",
  "user9": "Yeah. It is.",
  "system10": "Go well.",
  "user10": "Thank you.",
  "system11": "You're welcome.",
  "user11": "I\u2019ll let you know how it goes.",
  "system12": "Please do.",
  "user12": "I will.",
  "system13": "Good.",
  "user13": "Yeah.",
  "system14": "I\u2019m here when you need me.",
  "user14": "I know.",
  "system15": "Solid.",
  "user15": "Mm.",
  "system16": "You\u2019re set.",
  "user16": "Got it.",
  "system17": "Good.",
  "user17": "I\u2019m heading to Beond in six weeks for iboga and I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to be asking for. I keep building these beautiful sandcastles\u2014companies, boards, even the mom-and-wife resume\u2014and the tide keeps washing them out from under me. I want this one to last.",
  "system18": "Three threads:\n\n1. Build something that survives the tide\n2. Stop the cycle of wash-outs\n3. Keep what actually matters\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user18": "Yeah\u2026 those three feel right. I guess I\u2019m scared that if I aim too small I\u2019ll just build another sandcastle, but if I aim too big I\u2019ll freeze and keep doing what I\u2019ve always done\u2014stack achievements like a shield.\n\nSo, intentions, not board-room goals\u2026 okay:\n\n1. Let the medicine show me which parts of my life are already stone, not sand, so I can stop frantically rebuilding every time a wave hits.\n\n2. Give me the guts to sweep away any castle I\u2019m still guarding that I already know won\u2019t survive\u2014no more \u201cjust one more tower\u201d rationalizing.\n\n3. Teach me how to notice, daily, when I\u2019m picking up the plastic bucket again, so I can set it down before another whole day disappears into the dunes.\n\nThat feel concrete enough without turning into a quarterly OKR?",
  "system19": "They\u2019re concrete and they\u2019re yours. Three intentions locked:\n\n1. I trust the medicine to show me what\u2019s already stone in my life.  \n2. I release castles I already know won\u2019t survive.  \n3. I catch myself reaching for the plastic bucket and set it down.  \n\nKeep them in your wallet or phone lock-screen. Read them each morning until you sit with the medicine.\n\nYou\u2019re set.",
  "user19": "I\u2019ll write them on the back of the little photo of my grandmother I keep in my wallet\u2014she knew how to build stone. Thanks for holding the line with me."
