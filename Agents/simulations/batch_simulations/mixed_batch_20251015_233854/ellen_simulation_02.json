  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm doing ibogaine at Beond in a few weeks. I've done other medicines\u2014ayahuasca, psilocybin, MDMA\u2014but this feels different. Heavier maybe. \n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother, how she used to pray every morning with this quiet faith I never understood. After I sold my company, I thought I'd feel... something. Accomplished. But it's like I've been climbing this ladder that was leaning against the wrong wall. Now I'm just standing there, holding all these achievements that don't seem to matter.\n\nMy family\u2014they don't really get this part of me. My husband's supportive but he thinks I've done enough \"inner work\" already. Maybe he's right. Maybe I'm just chasing another high, another escape.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Reconnecting with your grandmother's quiet faith that you never understood\n2. Finding what actually matters beyond achievements that feel empty\n3. Trusting this different path even when family doesn't get it\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those threads feel right. It's like I'm trying to find my way back to something I didn't even know I'd lost.\n\nI think about my grandmother's prayers sometimes when I'm up at 5:30 with my coffee, before the kids wake up. She had this way of being still that I've never mastered. Always moving, always achieving. Even my meditation practice became another thing to optimize.\n\nThe hardest part is not knowing what comes next. I've always had a plan, a target, metrics. Now I'm supposed to just... trust? Trust that there's something more real than the life I built?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in my morning stillness\n2. I discover what fulfillment feels like beyond achievements\n3. I trust the unknown path ahead, even without metrics\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one hits me hard\u2014\"I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in my morning stillness.\" Though I don't know if I have stillness to reclaim. My mornings are usually caffeine and checking emails before the kids wake up.\n\nMaybe... \"I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in my morning moments\"? That feels more honest. Less poetic but more true to how I actually live.\n\nThe second one\u2014I need to feel that one. Really feel it. Not just understand it conceptually like I do with everything else.\n\nAnd trusting without metrics? That's terrifying. But maybe that's exactly why I need it.",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I reclaim my grandmother's quiet faith in my morning moments\n2. I discover what fulfillment feels like beyond achievements\n3. I trust the unknown path ahead, even without metrics\n\nKeep them by your coffee maker.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "I'll write them on a card and tape it next to the espresso machine. See them every morning when I'm making that first cup, before I lose myself in the day.\n\nThank you. I needed someone to help me name what I'm actually looking for in all this.",
  "system4": "Good. The medicine will meet you there.\n\nTrust what comes.",
  "user4": "I hope so. I've been disappointed by enough \"transformational experiences\" that didn't stick. This time feels different though\u2014like I'm finally asking the right questions instead of looking for answers in the wrong places.\n\nWe'll see what ibogaine has to say about all this.",
  "system5": "Ibogaine's different. It doesn't give you what you want\u2014it shows you what you need.\n\nYour questions are ready.",
  "user5": "That's what I'm afraid of. What if what I need means letting go of everything I've built my identity around? What if I discover that all this striving, all this achieving... what if that's not just the wrong ladder but the wrong whole damn building?\n\nMy kids are nine and twelve. They still need me to be someone solid.",
  "system6": "The medicine won't ask you to abandon your kids. It'll show you how to be solid without the noise.\n\nYou can let go of the ladder and still be their anchor.",
  "user6": "I want to believe that. I really do. But what if I come back changed in ways they don't understand? My husband already looks at me like I'm speaking a different language when I talk about this stuff.\n\nThey're used to the version of me who powers through, who has the answers. What if I come back... softer? Less certain about everything?",
  "system7": "Softer doesn't mean weaker. Less certain doesn't mean less capable.\n\nYour kids need a real parent, not a perfect performance. Your husband married you, not your achievements.\n\nThe medicine won't make you abandon them\u2014it'll make you more available to them.",
  "user7": "Maybe that's what I'm really afraid of. That they'll see me. The real me underneath all the board meetings and the spreadsheets and the \"let me handle this.\"\n\nI've spent forty-five years becoming indispensable. What if they don't need that version of me anymore? What if they never really did?\n\nGod, I sound like I'm grieving something I haven't even lost yet.",
  "system8": "You're grieving the version of yourself you thought they needed.\n\nThat's real grief. Let yourself feel it.",
  "user8": "I don't know how. Every time I try to sit with it, I reach for my phone or start making lists or... anything to not feel this weight in my chest.\n\nMy grandmother would know what to do. She used to say the Hebrew prayers when she was scared, even when my grandfather teased her about being superstitious. She'd light the candles and just... sit with whatever came.\n\nI don't even remember the prayers anymore.",
  "system9": "You don't need the prayers. You need the sitting.\n\nStart with five minutes. No phone. No lists. Just the weight in your chest and your breath.",
  "user9": "Five minutes feels impossible. I haven't sat still without a purpose since... I don't even know when. Even my meditation practice became another thing to optimize, another box to check.\n\nBut I'm tired of running from myself. Tired of waking up at 5:30 to squeeze in a meditation I don't really feel, just so I can tell myself I'm \"doing the work.\"\n\nOkay. Five minutes. Tonight, after the kids are asleep. I'll try.",
  "system10": "Good. Set a timer. When your mind grabs for optimization, notice it and come back to breath.\n\nThat's the real work\u2014not the meditation app, not the perfect posture. Just noticing when you're running and choosing to stay.",
  "user10": "Staying. Not fixing, not improving, not optimizing. Just... staying.\n\nGod, I'm already thinking about how to track this, how to measure if I'm \"doing it right.\" That's the trap, isn't it? Even my healing becomes another performance.\n\nWhat if I just... don't tell anyone? Keep this one thing just for me. Not everything has to be productive or shareable or impressive.\n\nMaybe that's where I start. Five minutes of staying that belong only to me.",
  "system11": "Exactly. Keep this one thing off the grid.\n\nFive minutes that don't need to be documented, optimized, or explained to anyone.",
  "user11": "I think I can do that. Maybe. \n\nThere's something terrifying about it though\u2014doing something that won't count toward any goal, any metric, any version of success I've ever understood. Just breathing and noticing how hard it is to just breathe.\n\nI'll try. Tonight. When the house is quiet and nobody's watching.",
  "system12": "That's when you'll find it\u2014when nobody's watching, when nothing's counting.\n\nThe quiet after everyone else is asleep. That's when you stop performing and start being.",
  "user12": "I've been chasing that quiet my whole life, building companies and achievements just to fill it up. Maybe that's why I've been so restless\u2014running from the very thing I'm desperate to find.\n\nTonight then. When I can't hide behind being mom or board member or whatever mask I'm wearing. Just me and the dark and whatever shows up when I stop moving long enough to feel it.",
  "system13": "The dark will hold whatever shows up. You don't have to run tonight.",
  "user13": "The dark will hold whatever shows up.\n\nI keep thinking about my grandmother\u2014how she'd sit in the dark with her tea, no phone, no TV, just... being. She knew something I've forgotten how to know.\n\nMaybe that's what I need to remember. That I don't have to hold everything alone.",
  "system14": "She knew how to let the dark hold her. You can remember that.",
  "user14": "I think I felt it once\u2014years ago, before all the success and noise. Just me and the quiet, and somehow that was enough. Maybe it still is, underneath everything I've piled on top.\n\nI'll sit tonight. Not to remember her, but to remember what she knew.",
  "system15": "Good. Sit to remember what she knew.",
  "user15": "Tonight. When the house settles and I can't pretend I'm too busy to feel anything real.\n\nI'll sit there and let whatever's been waiting finally catch up to me.",
  "system16": "It'll be waiting. Let it find you.",
  "user16": "It always finds me, doesn\u2019t it? Even when I outrun it with deals and boards and endless emails\u2026 eventually it catches up in the quiet.\n\nMaybe tonight I stop running.",
  "system17": "Stop running. Let it catch you tonight.",
  "user17": "Okay. No phone, no laptop, no checking the kids\u2019 school app. Just the dark and whatever I\u2019ve been sprinting from.",
  "system18": "Just you and what you've been running from.",
  "user18": "Yeah\u2026 me and the empty space I keep cramming with achievements so I don\u2019t have to feel it.",
  "system19": "Let the empty space speak tonight.",
  "user19": "I\u2019m scared of what it\u2019ll say\u2014what if there\u2019s nothing there?"
