  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Heroic Hearts accepted me into the program. Said this plant medicine might help with... the nightmares. Been waking up shouting three, four times a week. Amanda\u2014my wife\u2014she's about had it. Can't say I blame her.\n\nDon't believe in this stuff, honestly. But I've tried everything else. Can't lose her. Can't lose the kids. So here I am.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without shouting\n2. Amanda feels safe again \n3. Keep your family together\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. That's... that's about right.\n\nI just want to sleep without waking up swinging. Want Amanda to stop looking at me like I'm some kind of bomb that might go off. Want to be the man they think I am, not... whatever this is.\n\nHow do we do this?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n3. I become the man my family trusts\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. About safety. \n\n\"I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself.\" That's... that's good. Strong. Not some soft bullshit about feelings. Safety is real. Something you can hold onto.\n\nThe other two feel too... I don't know. The first one sounds like I'm asking for a miracle. Third one makes it sound like I'm not already trying to be that man. Been trying. Just... not working.\n\nBut safety. Yeah. I can work with that.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself\n\nHow do the other two land? Want to make them more concrete?",
  "user3": "The sleep one... I don't know. \"Peacefully\" feels like too much to ask for. Maybe just \"I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me down.\"\n\nAnd the family one... maybe \"I show up steady for my family, the way a man's supposed to.\" Something like that. Not about trusting\u2014about me being reliable. Present. Not jumping at every loud noise or checking the exits when we're at dinner.\n\nThat feel more... doable?",
  "system4": "Your 3 intentions:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without the dreams taking me down\n2. I reclaim safety for Amanda and myself  \n3. I show up steady for my family, the way a man's supposed to\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Got it. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... appreciate it.",
  "system5": "Good. The medicine works even when you forget the words.\n\nSee you on the other side.",
  "user5": "Yeah. See you there.",
  "system6": "Solid compass. Trust what comes.",
