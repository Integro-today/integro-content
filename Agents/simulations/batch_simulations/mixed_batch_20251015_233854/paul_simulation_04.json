  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... well, with whatever's going on. I can't keep going like this, waking up Amanda with the... whatever. She says I scare her sometimes when I shout in my sleep. I hate that.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Stop scaring Amanda when you shout in your sleep\n2. Find peace in your nights so she can rest\n3. Feel safe at home again\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... I guess that about sums it up. I just want to sleep through the damn night without... without whatever this is. I don't need to be some touchy-feely version of myself, I just need to stop... stop being this guy who wakes up ready to fight shadows.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. Amanda feels safe beside me again\n3. I release the fight that's not mine to carry\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one's not right. Amanda... she's never said she doesn't feel safe. Just that I startle her when I shout. But the first one... \"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" That's it. That's what I want. Just to close my eyes and wake up when the alarm goes off, not when I'm... when it's happening again.",
  "system3": "Got it. Let's adjust:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I stop startling Amanda when I shout in my sleep\n3. I release the fight that's not mine to carry\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user3": "The first one's good. The second one... I don't know, it makes it sound like I'm some kind of... like I can't control myself. But I guess that's the point, isn't it? That I can't. \n\nThe third one though - \"I release the fight that's not mine to carry.\" I don't even know what that means. I'm not carrying anything that isn't mine. I did what I had to do over there, and I don't regret it. I just need to... I need to shut it off when I'm home.",
  "system4": "Let's make that third one match what you actually need:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I stop startling Amanda when I shout in my sleep\n3. I leave the fight overseas where it belongs\n\nHow's that?",
  "user4": "Yeah... that third one's better. \"I leave the fight overseas where it belongs.\" That's what I need - to stop bringing that shit home with me. Amanda and the kids... they shouldn't have to deal with any of that. \n\nBut I still don't like the second one. \"I stop startling Amanda when I shout in my sleep.\" Makes me sound... I don't know. Weak. Like I can't handle my own business. What about something like... \"I rest quietly through the night\" or... I don't know. Something that doesn't make me sound broken.",
  "system5": "How about:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. My nights stay quiet for Amanda\n3. I leave the fight overseas where it belongs\n\nThat work better?",
  "user5": "Yeah... yeah, that works. \"My nights stay quiet for Amanda.\" That's better. Not about me being broken, just... taking care of my own. Like I'm supposed to.\n\nThese three feel right. I can hold onto these.",
  "system6": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. My nights stay quiet for Amanda\n3. I leave the fight overseas where it belongs\n\nKeep them in your wallet, morning routine, wherever you'll see them.\n\nThese are your compass. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user6": "Got it. I'll write 'em down. Keep 'em in my wallet\u2014been carrying that thing for years. Seems right to keep these close too.\n\nThanks. I... I appreciate you helping me get this straight.",
  "system7": "You're welcome. \n\nSolid compass. Trust what comes.",
