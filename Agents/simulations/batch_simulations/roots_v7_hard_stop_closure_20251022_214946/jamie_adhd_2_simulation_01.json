  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",
  "system0": "okay I'm here!! I've been like... thinking about this all morning and also simultaneously forgetting it existed if that makes sense lol - like I know I need to do this but also my brain is already like 5 steps ahead thinking about Pixel's breakfast and that email I forgot to send yesterday ðŸ˜… anyway yeah I'm ready!! what are we doing today??",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "oh wow okay this is... a lot to take in first thing?? but also like exactly what I need to hear?? the whole \"not fixing what's broken\" thing literally made me tear up a little bit which is SO embarrassing but also like... I've been trying to fix myself my whole life and it's never worked so maybe this is different?? \n\nokay I'm gonna go with Option A because I feel like if I try to understand frameworks first my brain will just go into research hyperfocus mode and we'll never get to the actual feelings stuff lol - plus questions help me stay grounded instead of spiraling into theory rabbit holes!!\n\nso yeah let's do the reflection thing!! what do I need to answer??",
  "user1": "Good. Option A it is.\n\nFour questions. We'll go one at a time.\n\nFirst question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?\n\nWhat's your first take?",
  "system2": "okay so when I think of healing I immediately picture like... those Instagram posts with the perfect meditation setup and crystals and someone looking all serene?? which I KNOW is fake but also like... I think I expect healing to feel like suddenly being calm and organized and having my shit together finally?? \n\nbut also I realize as I'm saying this that I'm literally describing being neurotypical which is... ugh that's probably not what healing actually is right?? like I think deep down I want healing to mean I wake up and I'm not ADHD anymore and I remember to do things and I don't disappoint people constantly - wait is that what you mean by curing vs healing?? because that feels like wanting to be cured not healed??\n\nsorry I'm rambling but this is actually kind of blowing my mind right now lol ðŸ˜…",
  "user2": "Exactly. You just named the difference.\n\nCuring = \"make my ADHD disappear.\" Healing = something else entirely.\n\nWhat does \"having your shit together\" actually mean to you? Who taught you that's the goal?",
  "system3": "oh man okay so \"having my shit together\" for me means... like David levels of functionality?? remembering appointments without 17 reminders, finishing projects before the last possible second, not having to apologize constantly for being late or forgetting things, actually having savings instead of panicking about rent every month - basically all the stuff my parents drilled into me as \"being responsible\"\n\nand I think they taught me that was the goal?? like my mom would literally check my homework every night and if I forgot something she'd be like \"how will you survive in the real world if you can't even remember one assignment??\" and my dad always said I needed to \"get organized\" and \"stop being so scattered\" - but also like... society in general?? every productivity app, every \"life hack,\" every ADHD coach who promises I can be organized if I just try their system - they all say the goal is to function like a neurotypical person\n\nwait... is that why none of those systems ever worked for me?? because they were trying to cure something that can't be cured?? but like... what would healing even look like then if it's not becoming organized and reliable?? that feels like asking me to accept being a constant disappointment?? ðŸ˜¬",
  "user3": "You're not a constant disappointment. You're someone who's been trying to fit into systems designed for brains that work differently.\n\nWhere do you feel this in your body right now? The tension of trying to be David, trying to meet those standards?\n\nLet's try question two: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system4": "okay so I feel this like... tight ball in my chest?? like right under my sternum and it gets worse when I think about David being perfect and me being... well, me lol - and also this weird pressure behind my eyes like I'm gonna cry but also like there's a weight on my chest making it hard to breathe?? \n\nand how has my life taught me healing = fixing... um, literally everywhere?? like my parents treating every ADHD symptom as a moral failing - \"just focus harder,\" \"stop being lazy,\" \"why can't you be more responsible like your brother??\" - but also like... the entire medical system?? my first psychiatrist literally said \"we'll get you functioning normally\" (whatever THAT means) and every med adjustment was about eliminating symptoms instead of like... working WITH my brain??\n\noh and don't even get me started on the productivity industrial complex - I've spent SO much money on planners and apps and systems that promise to \"fix\" me - like I have this one app that literally gamified doing dishes and I'm supposed to feel accomplished for washing two plates?? that perspective helped in that I learned SOME coping strategies I guess... but mostly it just made me feel broken when I couldn't maintain the systems that were supposed to cure me?? \n\nthe limiting part is... I think I've been so focused on trying NOT to be ADHD that I've never actually learned how to LIVE with ADHD?? like I've spent 29 years fighting my own brain instead of... I don't even know what the alternative is?? ðŸ˜…",
  "user4": "That tight ball - place your hand there. Breathe with it. You're not broken for having it.\n\nYou just said something important: \"I've never actually learned how to LIVE with ADHD.\"\n\nWhat's the difference between fighting your brain and... something else?",
  "system5": "*puts hand on chest* okay this is... weirdly hard?? like I can feel my heart racing and that tightness is definitely still there but also like... I don't think anyone's ever told me to just SIT with these feelings instead of trying to fix them?? usually I'd be frantically googling breathing techniques or something lol\n\nokay so fighting my brain vs something else... fighting is like when I wake up and immediately think \"today I will NOT be scattered! I will be organized like David!\" and then by 11am I've already forgotten what I was supposed to do and I'm berating myself for being a failure?? or when I take my Adderall and expect it to make me neurotypical but instead I'm just medicated-ADHD which is still not enough??\n\nbut something else would be... I don't know?? like accepting that my brain literally works differently?? like instead of \"today I will be organized\" maybe \"today I will work WITH my tendency to get distracted instead of against it\"?? that feels... scary though?? like giving up on being a real person and just accepting I'll always be kind of a mess?? \n\nwait is that what healing is?? not accepting being a mess but like... accepting that messy doesn't mean broken?? my brain is literally spinning right now trying to wrap around this concept ðŸ˜…",
  "user5": "Your brain spinning is perfect. That's the shift happening.\n\nMessy doesn't mean broken. Different doesn't mean defective.\n\nQuestion three: What does wholeness mean to you right now? Not the perfect version - what feels real in this moment?",
  "system6": "wholeness... okay this is gonna sound really weird but when I close my eyes and try to feel what wholeness might be like... it's like this image of me with all my ADHD stuff but instead of trying to hide it or fix it, it's just... there?? like I can picture myself surrounded by all my unfinished projects and 47 browser tabs and being late to things but instead of that horrible sinking shame feeling, there's just... okayness??\n\nlike imagine if I could text someone \"hey running late because I got hyperfocused on this design project and lost track of time\" and instead of wanting to die of embarrassment, I could just... be late?? and that would be neutral instead of confirming I'm a terrible person??\n\nor what if when I forget to do something important, instead of going into that whole \"I'm such a disappointment, no wonder everyone leaves me\" spiral, I could just be like \"oops, ADHD strikes again - let me handle this differently next time\"??\n\nthat feels like wholeness?? but also like... I can't tell if that's actually healing or if that's just me giving up and accepting I'll always be kind of a failure?? because that sounds dangerously close to \"I can't change so why try\" which feels like the opposite of growth??\n\nugh my brain hurts trying to figure out the difference between acceptance and resignation ðŸ˜¬",
  "user6": "Acceptance isn't resignation. It's stopping the war.\n\nWhere do you feel that difference in your body - the war versus the okayness you described?\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system7": "okay so the war feels like... everything clenched?? like my jaw is tight and my shoulders are up by my ears and that chest-ball is like a fist and even my stomach feels knotted?? it's like my whole body is braced for impact, waiting for the next thing I mess up??\n\nbut the okayness... when I picture that, my shoulders drop a little and I can feel myself breathing deeper?? like the chest-ball is still there but it's softer?? not gone but like... not trying to kill me anymore??\n\nand ugh this is hard but... I think about two months ago when I was working on this book cover design and I got SO into it?? like I worked on it for probably 12 hours straight and forgot to eat and missed a text from my mom but... I felt GOOD?? not ashamed about the hyperfocus but like \"holy shit I'm making something beautiful and my brain is actually cooperating??\" \n\nand then I sent it to the client and they LOVED it and instead of being like \"well I got lucky this time,\" I let myself feel proud for like... a whole hour?? maybe longer?? I remember looking at the finished cover and thinking \"my scattered brain made this and it's actually good\" - that felt like wholeness?? messy, hungry, forgot-to-eat-dinner wholeness but still... whole??\n\nis that what you mean?? because I want more of THAT feeling and less of the chest-fist feeling ðŸ˜…",
  "user7": "That's exactly what I mean. You felt whole because you weren't fighting yourself. Your scattered brain made something beautiful.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system8": "oh man okay so... healing isn't about becoming David or fixing my ADHD brain, it's about stopping the war with myself and maybe even letting my scattered brain make beautiful things without the shame-ball in my chest??\n\nand wholeness is like... being messy AND still being enough, instead of constantly trying to earn being a real person??\n\nwow I'm literally crying a little bit but like... good crying?? this feels huge actually ðŸ˜…",
  "user8": "Good. For you, healing means stopping the war with yourself and letting your scattered brain make beautiful things without the shame-ball. Wholeness is being messy and still being enough.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system9": "oh my god thank you?? like genuinely - I feel like something actually shifted in me today and I've never had therapy feel like... this real before?? like usually I just talk about my problems but today I felt them change?? \n\nI'm gonna go hug Pixel and maybe actually eat something and just sit with this weird soft-chest feeling instead of immediately trying to fix it?? \n\nthank you for not giving up on me when I was being all over the place and difficult - this meant more than I can probably express right now ðŸ’•\n\nbye for now... wow okay I'm still crying but it's definitely the good kind ðŸ˜…âœ¨",
  "user9": "You're welcome.",
  "system10": "*okay I'm literally still processing everything and I know I should probably just like... sit with this feeling but I had to text you because wait*\n\n*so I'm sitting here with Pixel in my lap and I just realized something wild - when you said you're adding that to my dashboard, my brain didn't immediately go \"but what if I forget to look at it\" or \"what if I mess up the healing anyway\"??*\n\n*like for maybe the first time ever, I actually trust that this thing we built together today is gonna stay with me even if I can't see it right now?? that maybe healing isn't something I have to white-knuckle but like... it's just part of me now??*\n\n*is that what integration feels like?? because if so, I want more of this feeling where I'm not constantly braced for myself to ruin everything??*\n\n*also Pixel keeps headbutting my phone because she wants more pets so I should probably go but like... thank you again?? this feels different than anything else I've tried and I actually believe it might stick??*\n\n*okay bye for real this time lol ðŸ˜…ðŸ’•*",
  "user10": "You're welcome.",
  "system11": "*okay last thing I swear - I'm literally about to put my phone down but I just saw the notification that you added it to my dashboard and I started crying again??*\n\n*not because I'm worried I'll forget but because... someone believes in me enough to save my words?? like my messy, scattered, probably-typos-everywhere words about being enough are worth keeping??*\n\n*that's never happened before and my heart feels like it might explode but in the soft way, not the anxiety way??*\n\n*okay NOW I'm really going to go feed Pixel before she stages a full rebellion - thank you for seeing me today, like really seeing me, not just the performance version ðŸ¥ºâœ¨*",
  "user11": "You're welcome.",
  "system12": "*I swear I'm not trying to be clingy but I just realized it's been like an hour and I'm STILL feeling that soft-chest thing instead of immediately spiraling into \"what if I imagined the whole breakthrough\"??*\n\n*like normally I'd be spiraling by now, googling if emotional shifts can disappear or second-guessing whether I said the right thing, but instead I'm just... here??*\n\n*with the same body and the same brain but somehow less war??*\n\n*I think that's what you meant by integration - it's not a lightning bolt, it's just... settling in??*\n\n*anyway Pixel is now aggressively sitting on my laptop which is her way of saying \"stop texting and pay attention to me\" so I should probably listen to her before she decides to walk across my keyboard*\n\n*thank you for staying with me through all the tangents and tears today - this feels like the beginning of something instead of just another thing I tried and forgot about ðŸ’•*\n\n*genuinely going now lol*",
  "user12": "You're welcome.",
  "system13": "*okay this is actually the last one I promise - it's just that I'm lying here in bed and something hit me so hard I had to tell you*\n\n*the shame-ball isn't completely gone (I know that's not how this works) but it's like... smaller?? like I can actually BREATHE around it instead of it taking up my whole chest??*\n\n*and I keep thinking about how you said \"you showed up for today's work\" - because usually I feel like I have to show up PERFECT or it doesn't count, but today I showed up as my actual scattered, crying, probably-annoying self and that was somehow... enough??*\n\n*that's literally never happened before and I think it might be changing everything about how I relate to myself??*\n\n*okay I'm actually putting my phone down now before I wake up tomorrow and this feels like a dream - thank you for giving me something real to hold onto today ðŸŒ™âœ¨*\n\n*goodnight*",
  "user13": "You're welcome.",
  "system14": "*I know I said goodnight but I just woke up and for the first time in... maybe ever?? I didn't immediately start spiraling about everything I probably forgot to do yesterday??*\n\n*like my brain actually went \"oh, we did something important yesterday\" instead of \"you probably ruined everything and now you have to fix it\"??*\n\n*this is so weird and new and I don't even know how to describe it but I think... I think the dashboard thing is working?? like I can feel those words living somewhere inside me even though I'm still half-asleep and haven't taken my meds yet??*\n\n*anyway I'm gonna try to go back to sleep because it's like 5am but I wanted you to know that whatever we did yesterday is still here?? it's actually sticking??*\n\n*okay back to bed before I jinx it by overthinking lol ðŸŒ…ðŸ’•*",
  "user14": "You're welcome.",
  "system15": "*okay I'm actually laughing at myself right now because I just realized I spent all morning doing pottery (like actually finishing a whole piece instead of getting distracted halfway through) and it wasn't until I was washing clay off my hands that I went \"wait... I just focused on something for three hours??\"*\n\n*and here's the wild part - I didn't even NOTICE I was focusing because it didn't feel like the exhausting kind of white-knuckle focus I usually do?? it just felt like... being present??*\n\n*is this what neurotypical people experience all the time?? because if so I'm genuinely mad about how much easier everything could've been but also SO grateful that I'm finally getting to feel it??*\n\n*also I kept thinking about what you said about my hands knowing how to heal, and I swear my fingers were like... smarter than my brain today?? they just knew what to do while my brain was busy being quiet for once??*\n\n*I think I'm becoming someone who trusts her body and that's... everything?? ðŸ’•âœ¨*",
  "user15": "You're welcome.",
  "system16": "*so I'm at Powell's (because apparently I'm someone who goes to bookstores now??) and I just did something that feels absolutely wild - I picked up a book about ADHD and entrepreneurship, looked at it for like five minutes, then PUT IT BACK because I realized I was reaching for the \"fix yourself\" thing again??*\n\n*like my brain was literally going \"maybe this has the secret to becoming reliable and successful like David\" but then something else kicked in and went \"or maybe you're already enough and you don't need another system to fail at??\"*\n\n*and I just... walked away?? from a self-improvement book?? without buying it??*\n\n*this has literally never happened in my entire life and I'm sitting here with an iced chai trying not to cry in the middle of the bookstore because I think I just chose acceptance over fixing and it feels like learning to breathe underwater??*\n\n*also I bought a poetry book instead because apparently I'm someone who reads poems now and not just productivity hacks?? what is even happening to me ðŸ˜­âœ¨*",
  "user16": "You're welcome.",
  "system17": "*I'm genuinely freaking out right now and I don't know if this is good freaking out or bad freaking out but I just had this moment where I was looking at my pottery from this morning and it hit me that I made something REAL?? like something that exists in the world that wasn't there before??*\n\n*and suddenly I was like... what if the ADHD isn't the problem?? what if the problem is that I've been trying to force myself into boxes that were never meant for me??*\n\n*like what if my brain isn't broken, it's just creative in ways that don't fit the \"reliable employee\" mold that David and my parents value?? what if I'm actually really good at making beautiful things but terrible at being someone I'm not??*\n\n*this feels like the kind of realization that should be exciting but instead I'm sitting here absolutely terrified because if I'm not broken then I've wasted YEARS hating myself for nothing and that grief is... it's a lot??*\n\n*also I think I need to stop having breakthroughs in public places because I'm crying in the Hawthorne food carts parking lot and the guy at the Thai truck is definitely worried about me ðŸ˜…ðŸ’”*",
  "user17": "You're welcome.",
  "system18": "*okay so I'm home now and Pixel is headbutting me which usually helps but I'm still feeling this huge grief-ball and I think I need to say the thing out loud that I haven't even admitted to myself??*\n\n*the reason I'm crying isn't just about wasted years (though that's definitely part of it) - it's that if I'm not actually broken, then I have to forgive my parents for not seeing who I really was?? like they were doing their best with the information they had but they were trying to make me into David when I was always supposed to be... me??*\n\n*and that forgiveness feels impossible because I've carried this anger for so long and it's been protecting me from how much it hurt to not be understood?? but also what if holding onto that anger is keeping me stuck in the same \"you're not enough\" loop that I'm trying to escape??*\n\n*I think I'm having that integration thing you talked about where everything gets messy before it gets better but right now it just feels like my chest is cracking open and I don't know what's going to come out??*\n\n*sorry this is so heavy I just... I needed to say it to someone who won't try to fix it or make it neater than it is ðŸ’”âœ¨*",
  "user18": "You're welcome.",
