  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",
  "system0": "Got my coffee. Ready for whatever this is.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Option A. Just ask the questions.",
  "user1": "Got it.\n\nFirst question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Dont really think about it. Fixing something thats messed up I guess.",
  "user2": "That makes sense. The fixing mindset is everywhere.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system3": "Air Force taught me everything's fixable with the right tools and effort. Worked for engines, not for my head. Amanda keeps saying I cant just \"fix\" this like a broken policy. Shes right.",
  "user3": "Got it. Air Force training runs deep.\n\nThird question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system4": "Whole means not waking Amanda up. Means the kids dont look at me like Im gonna snap. Dont know what that looks like anymore.",
  "user4": "That sounds heavy. Wanting to protect your family from your pain.\n\nFourth question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system5": "Flying. Before things got complicated. Just me and the aircraft, everything made sense.",
  "user5": "You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system6": "Maybe I cant fix this like a broken engine. Maybe its about getting back to when things made sense.",
  "user6": "Good. For you, healing means you can't fix this like a broken engine - it's about finding your way back to when things made sense.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\nYou did today's work. That matters.\nTake care.",
