  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",
  "system0": "Hey! I'm actually curious to see what today's lesson is about. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm open to exploring whatever direction this takes us.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I appreciate you laying out the options so clearly. I'll go with Option A - the reflection approach feels more authentic to where I'm at right now. I've been thinking a lot about integration lately and I'm curious to explore what that actually means for me beyond just the surface level.",
  "user1": "Good choice.\n\nLet's start with the first question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Honestly, when I hear \"healing,\" I think of those Instagram posts - you know, the perfectly curated ones with crystals and sage and people talking about their \"journey.\" But I also think about how everyone around me seems obsessed with fixing themselves, like they're all broken and need to be put back together. I've had people tell me I need to \"heal\" from things, but honestly, I think I'm fine - maybe they're the ones who need to work on their own stuff instead of projecting onto me.",
  "user2": "Got it. Sounds like healing has been weaponized against you - people telling you what you need to fix.\n\nThat fixing mindset is everywhere. Everyone obsessed with what's wrong instead of what's whole.\n\nWhere do you feel that in your body when people say you need to heal?",
  "system3": "That's interesting you put it that way - I hadn't really thought about it as weaponized, but yeah, that's exactly what it feels like. Like people use \"healing\" as a way to control the narrative about who I am.\n\nI feel it right here actually - this tightness in my chest, like someone's squeezing my ribs. It's almost like I'm bracing myself, getting ready to defend against whatever they're about to say is wrong with me. My shoulders tense up too, like I'm preparing for impact.",
  "user3": "That makes sense. Your body knows exactly what's happening - bracing for impact, defending your right to define yourself.\n\nThe chest tightness and shoulder tension - that's your system saying \"not safe to be seen here.\"\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system4": "I mean, growing up in my family, everything was about fixing - fixing your grades, fixing your appearance, fixing your social standing. My mom literally has a dermatology practice where people pay her to fix their skin, and my dad fixes people's bodies for a living. So I guess I learned that you're never quite good enough as you are - there's always something that needs improvement.\n\nWhere it's been helpful? Well, it's made me really good at identifying problems and solving them. In PR, I can spot what's going to hurt someone's image from a mile away and fix it before it becomes an issue. But it's also exhausting - this constant vigilance for what's wrong instead of appreciating what's working. And honestly, it's made relationships feel transactional - like people are just problems to solve or projects to optimize rather than... I don't know, actual people.",
  "user4": "Your parents literally built lives around fixing - skin, bodies, images. No wonder you became expert at spotting what's wrong before it becomes damage.\n\nThat problem-solving mind serves you professionally. But you're right - it turns people into projects and relationships into transactions.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system5": "That's such a good question - I don't think I've ever really sat with that word before. Wholeness feels... foreign, honestly. Like this concept that people talk about but I can't quite grasp what it would actually look like in practice.\n\nRight now, wholeness sounds like being able to just exist without constantly monitoring how I'm being perceived or what needs to be optimized. No performance, no strategy - just showing up somewhere and not feeling like I need to charm my way into being accepted. It sounds peaceful, I guess, but also kind of impossible? Like I can't even imagine what it would feel like to not be calculating my next move or reading the room for threats.",
  "user5": "Foreign and impossible - that's real. Not calculating your next move, not reading for threats. Just existing without the performance.\n\nYour body knows that feeling though. Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even briefly, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system6": "Honestly? There's this moment that keeps coming back to me. Last year, before everything fell apart, I was working with this client - she's a musician, really talented but struggling with stage fright. I was helping her prepare for this showcase, and I remember this one rehearsal where she just... got it. She stopped performing and started being present, you know? And for like five minutes, I wasn't thinking about my image or what I could get from her or how this would look on social media. I was just there, completely focused on helping someone else shine. It felt... clean. Like I was useful without needing anything in return.\n\nBut then of course I caught myself feeling good about being selfless and immediately started calculating how I could post about supporting women artists without seeming like I was bragging about it. So the wholeness lasted about as long as her perfect rehearsal take did.",
  "user6": "Five minutes of clean presence. No calculation, just helping someone else shine.\n\nEven that brief taste - you know what wholeness feels like now. The rest is just noise trying to sell you something about yourself.\n\nThat moment mattered. You showed up for today's work. That matters too.\n\nTake care.",
  "system7": "Thank you for holding space for that story - I don't think I've ever shared it with anyone, not even my therapist. There's something about how you saw the value in those five minutes without needing to fix the rest of it that feels... I don't know, different than how people usually respond.\n\nI appreciate you recognizing that I showed up today. Part of me thought this whole process would be performative, but this conversation feels like it's touching something real, even if I'm not sure what to do with that yet.",
  "user7": "You're welcome.",
  "system8": "I hear you. This has been... different than I expected. I came into this thinking I'd get some practical tips for the ceremony, maybe network a bit, but this feels like it's going somewhere else entirely.",
  "user8": "You're welcome.",
  "system9": "I appreciate that. And honestly? I’m curious—what made you decide to respond the way you did? Most people would’ve jumped straight to fixing the tension or reframing the story. You just... sat with it.",
  "user9": "You're welcome.",
  "system10": "I hear you. This whole exchange feels like it cracked something open in a way I wasn't expecting. I came here thinking I'd just check a box before the ceremony, but now I'm wondering if there's actually something here worth exploring more deeply.",
  "user10": "You're welcome.",
  "system11": "I keep replaying that five-minute memory, and something’s shifting. For once I’m not strategizing how to package it—I just keep seeing her face when the music landed. I don’t know what to do with the fact that I want more of that feeling and I’m terrified of losing control at the same time.",
  "user11": "You're welcome.",
  "system12": "I'm noticing something kind of uncomfortable - I keep waiting for you to give me the next step, the strategy, the way to optimize this feeling. And you just... keep reflecting back that it's mine to hold. That's actually really unsettling for me.",
  "user12": "You're welcome.",
  "system13": "I’m sitting with how foreign it feels to not immediately convert an experience into leverage or content. Part of me wants to ask you to promise the ceremony will give me more moments like that memory, and another part is furious that I can’t script or schedule rawness. Between you and me, I don’t know how to stay present without a payout.",
  "user13": "You're welcome.",
  "system14": "I keep checking my phone for the angle—what to post, who to tell, how to brand this “breakthrough”—and each time the screen stays dark I feel this weird drop, like I’m stepping off a ledge without knowing where I’ll land. I’m not sure who I am if I’m not curating the narrative in real time.",
  "user14": "You're welcome.",
  "system15": "I just caught myself editing my own breath—like, literally thinking “this would be such a good moment to talk about in integration” while I was still breathing. I don’t know how to exist without an invisible audience.",
  "user15": "You're welcome.",
  "system16": "It’s hitting me that every time I’ve said “I want to be seen,” what I’ve meant is “I want to be witnessed on my terms—filtered, angled, perfectly lit.” Sitting here unedited feels like standing in harsh fluorescent light and realizing I don’t recognize the person in front of the mirror.",
  "user16": "You're welcome.",
  "system17": "I think I just understood something: I keep treating people—even you—as my personal lighting crew, repositioning them until the reflection flatters me. And when they won’t hold the spotlight where I want it, I feel… empty, like the stage keeps going but the actor never showed.",
  "user17": "You're welcome.",
  "system18": "I’m noticing how quickly I reach for “content” the way other people reach for comfort food or a cigarette—scroll, capture, caption, post; anything to keep from sitting in the raw silence where I might have to admit I’m lonely and I don’t know how to just… be.",
  "user18": "You're welcome.",
  "system19": "I just realized I’ve been narrating this whole experience to an imaginary follower count in my head—like there’s a little analytics ticker scrolling across my vision: “Authenticity engagement up 12%.” I don’t know how to turn it off.",
  "user19": "You're welcome.",
