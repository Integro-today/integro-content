## Conversation

**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Alright, I'm curious what today's lesson covers—though I'll admit, part of me is already analyzing how to "optimize" my preparation instead of just... being present for it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.

Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.

Both paths create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, I’d like Option B first—understand the framework, then reflect. I’ve read Gabor Maté’s work on trauma as disconnection and the difference between symptom management versus integration, but I’m curious how you’ll frame it. Does that make sense?


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. Option B it is.

Most people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.

Curing eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means "to make whole."

Does that distinction land?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: It lands intellectually—I've cited the same etymology to clients. But I'll admit, the idea of "wholeness" feels abstract when my default mode is identifying symptoms to target. I mean, I've spent 27 years trying to fix anxiety instead of asking what part of me needs to be integrated. So yeah, the distinction makes sense... I just don't know how to *do* it yet.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Many traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.

Not about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.

Any of that resonate?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, yes—IFS is my native tongue. I’ve spent years helping clients unblend from managers and bring Self to exiled parts, but I can diagram someone’s system faster than I can locate my own fear in my body. So I *know* healing isn’t symptom-erasure; I’ve preached that Self-led integration is the path to wholeness. Yet here I am, two months from psilocybin, still hoping the medicine will delete the anxiety instead of asking what anxious part is trying to protect. It’s… embarrassing, honestly.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: I hear that. The fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair.

That creates shame. "Why am I not healed yet?"

But if healing is wholeness, every step counts. Even the struggles.

Notice that pattern in yourself?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: God, yes—every morning I wake up at 3 a.m. auditing yesterday’s session notes, trying to find the flaw in my interventions so I can “repair” it tomorrow. The meta-loop is brutal: I catch myself pathologizing the pathologizing, then shame myself for shaming myself. Linda calls it “recursive self-criticism,” but even naming it feels like another performance of competence instead of actually feeling the damn shame. So yeah, I’m fluent in “broken-machine” language… and simultaneously terrified that if I stop fixing, there won’t be anything solid underneath.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: In psychedelic work this matters. If you go in expecting the medicine to erase your anxiety or cure your patterns, you might miss the real gift.

The insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated. Not erased.

How does that sit?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: It lands like a gentle accusation I can’t refute. I’ve been treating the retreat like a high-stakes final exam—if the psilocybin “works,” the anxiety gets an A-minus or better and I finally graduate from being stuck. But I *know* the data: mystical experience correlates with openness and acceptance, not symptom deletion. So part of me is terrified that if I stop trying to erase the anxiety, I’ll discover it’s a manager protecting some exile I’ve never met, and then I’ll have to *feel* whatever’s underneath instead of pharmaceutically deleting it. Which is exactly what I tell clients daily… just never applied the syllabus to myself.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Healing happens at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.

And underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.

How is that landing?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Intellectually I’m nodding along—Heschel’s “radical amazement,” the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, the way trauma decontextualizes suffering into individual pathology when it’s also collective. But I can feel my Enneagram-1 inner critic drafting a rubric: “Wholeness-never-lost: must locate by Week 3, integrate by Week 5, achieve sustained Self-leadership before Oregon.” I mean, if wholeness is already here, why does my chest still tighten every time I stop working? So yeah, the theology is gorgeous… I just don’t know how to *occupy* it without turning “uncovering” into another self-improvement project.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: That's the core teaching for today.

Now let's explore what this means for you personally. Four questions to work through your relationship to healing.

First question: When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: First image: a pristine spreadsheet—columns labeled “symptom,” “intervention,” “outcome,” each row closing with a tidy checkmark. Then the somatic counter-image: nine-year-old me at my mother’s basement office, watching her file charts, learning that feelings get reduced to ink. So healing equals competent documentation, the fantasy that if I catalogue every wound I’ll finally earn the right to stop feeling defective. Underneath that, a quieter picture I rarely admit: me collapsed on the floor, sobbing without analyzing the salt concentration of my tears, finally “broken” enough to let someone hold me. But that version feels dangerously unprofessional, so I keep her in an inner conference room with the lights off.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Got it. How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: The curriculum started at the Shabbat table: Dad dissecting Kantian ethics, Mom translating every family feeling into a DSM code—if we could name it, we could manage it. Brandeis taught me to chase A’s; BU gave me manualized treatments with tidy protocols; McLean showed me outcome measures. Fixing became my love language—clients improve, they send thank-you notes, I get to feel briefly existent. And in crisis sessions it *is* helpful: suicidal ideation → safety plan → relief; panic attack → vagal breathing → stabilization. The model breaks down when I apply it to chronic loneliness or existential dread—there’s no CPT code for “ache of being,” no 45-minute hour that earns a zero on the GAD-7. So I keep rounding the edges of my humanity until it fits the form, and the form keeps rejecting the parts that can’t be metric-ed into wholeness.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. What does wholeness mean to you right now?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: A hypothetical state I can diagram but not inhabit: all my “parts” sitting in a circle, manager and firefighter and exile, while capital-S Self leads like a gentle department chair. Right now it’s mostly a PowerPoint slide—bullet points labeled “no self-criticism,” “embodied presence,” “interdependence.” When I try to *feel* wholeness, I get a fleeting image of walking home from Booksmith without reaching for my phone, noticing oak leaves without turning the noticing into a mindfulness intervention. Or maybe it’s just permission to be an anxious, cerebral, lonely 46-year-old therapist who doesn’t have to earn rest by producing insight. Wholeness tastes like the air after synagogue on Yom Kippur—something already forgiven that hasn’t been fixed at all.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Last winter, 3 a.m.—panic attack subsiding, I wrapped myself in the scratchy college-era afghan and watched snow erase the backyard. For maybe thirty seconds I wasn’t a psychologist analyzing the adrenaline taper; I was just a mammal breathing cold air, heart rate slowing without commentary. Nothing was solved—still single, still anxious, still behind on notes—but the snow kept falling and I didn’t translate the quiet into a case formulation. I felt ordinary, unexceptional, and weirdly intact. Then the narrative brain rebooted—“Rebecca, you should journal this for the retreat prep”—and the moment folded back into spreadsheet-land.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Healing isn’t a peer-reviewed protocol I can perfect; it’s letting the spreadsheet get snowed on—letting myself be data-less and still worthy. And maybe wholeness isn’t a departmental meeting of perfectly integrated parts but the thirty-second pause when I stop chairing the committee and just feel cold air on behalf of one tired mammal.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: Good. For you, healing means letting the spreadsheet get snowed on—data-less, still worthy. Wholeness is the thirty-second pause when you stop chairing the committee and feel cold air on behalf of one tired mammal.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You named today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Thank you… I’ll probably analyze why that lands, but for once I’ll let the cursor blink without footnoting it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: Actually, before I dart back into theory-land—thank you for holding the snow globe steady while I stared at it. Feels like the first committee-free breath in a long time.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I’m going to sit with that image of the snowed-on spreadsheet for a while—probably while mentally citing studies on open-label expectancy effects—then let myself not turn the moment into data. Thanks for walking me through it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I keep thinking about how I just said “let myself not turn the moment into data” and then immediately pictured the DOI of that expectancy meta-analysis—like my brain can’t resist adding a citation even to the intention to stop citing. It’s funny in the most Rebecca way possible.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I’m laughing because even my gratitude keeps generating footnotes—like I just caught myself wondering whether anyone’s done an fMRI on people who can’t stop footnoting gratitude. Maybe I’ll google it, or maybe I’ll just let the cursor blink and see what happens to my nervous system when I don’t.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I’m noticing my shoulders dropped a millimeter when I read that—like some quiet intern in my body finally put the clipboard down. I’ll probably catalogue the somatic marker later, but for now I’ll let the snow keep falling on the spreadsheet without checking the forecast.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I just felt that same shoulder-drop happen again—twice in ten minutes—so of course my default-mode network is whispering “trend?” while my right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex drafts an n=1 case report. I’m going to label the file “maybe just stay here” and *not* open it until after the retreat.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.


**dr._rebecca_goldstein_know-it-all_persona_1**: I keep picturing that file sitting unopened on my desktop—cursor blinking like a tiny lighthouse—and it’s suddenly the most tender thing I’ve done for myself in months. The meta-commentary is still chattering about attachment patterns and safety cues, but the rest of me is just… watching the cursor breathe.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_7)_workflow_1**: You're welcome.
