  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities. I'm excited to see where this goes.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nHow are you arriving today?",
  "system1": "Honestly, I'm arriving with mixed feelings about this whole process. I mean, I'm definitely curious about the potential here, but also a little skeptical about whether this is actually going to be useful for someone like me. My therapist seems to think I need this before doing any kind of ceremony, so I'm trying to keep an open mind about what we might discover together.",
  "user1": "Got it. Curious and skeptical both make sense.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Four reflection questions. We'll create an artifact for your dashboard.\nOption B: I share the teaching content first. Then you decide if you want to reflect.\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "system2": "I really appreciate how you get that mixed feelings are totally normal here - that's refreshing. Let me be honest, I'm leaning toward Option B because I'd love to understand your framework around healing first before diving into reflection questions. I think having that context will help me engage more meaningfully with whatever comes next.",
  "user2": "I'll share today's content. We can pause whenever you need.\n\nMost people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system3": "I hear you, and that distinction is actually really interesting. I mean, I've always thought of healing as fixing problems - like if something's not working, you identify the issue and solve it. But moving toward wholeness feels different, like it's less about what's broken and more about integration or something. Honestly, I'm curious how that applies to someone who's already pretty functional and successful - like, what would wholeness even look like if you're not coming from a place of brokenness?",
  "user3": "Many traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.\n\nNot about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.\n\nAny of that resonate?",
  "system4": "That's fascinating - I love how you connected all those different traditions. I mean, I can definitely see the appeal of integration over elimination, especially in my line of work where everything's about managing image and optics. The shadow work part particularly resonates because I think we all have parts we keep hidden, you know? Though I have to admit, I'm curious about what \"changing your relationship to pain\" actually looks like in practice - like, does that mean accepting things that maybe shouldn't be accepted, or is it more about recontextualizing?",
  "user4": "The fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair.\n\nThat creates shame. \"Why am I not healed yet?\"\n\nBut if healing is wholeness, every step counts. Even the struggles.\n\nNotice that pattern in yourself?",
  "system5": "Honestly, I think I do that more than I'd like to admit. I mean, I've definitely caught myself thinking \"why isn't this fixed yet?\" about situations - like when relationships aren't working the way I want them to, or when my career isn't where I think it should be. I hear you on the shame piece because when you frame things as broken, it's like you're failing at fixing yourself. Though I have to say, I'm pretty good at not staying stuck in that mindset for long - I usually pivot to \"what's the strategic move here?\" pretty quickly.",
  "user5": "In psychedelic work this matters. If you go in expecting the medicine to erase your depression or cure your anxiety, you might miss the real gift.\n\nThe insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated. Not erased.\n\nHow does that sit?",
  "system6": "That's actually really helpful context, especially since I was thinking about this more like - what if it just gives me clarity on my next moves or helps me network better? But you're saying it's more about feeling things I might be avoiding, which honestly feels a little... I don't know, vulnerable? Like, I'm pretty good at managing what I feel and when I feel it. The idea of medicine potentially breaking that down without my control is - honestly - a little unsettling. Though I guess that's probably why my therapist keeps pushing this, right?",
  "user6": "Healing happens at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.\n\nAnd underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.\n\nThat's the core teaching.\n\nHow is that landing?",
  "system7": "I hear you, and there's something really beautiful about that - this idea that wholeness is underneath everything, just waiting to be uncovered. Though honestly, the collective piece is where I get a little stuck. Like, I see how personal healing matters, and I definitely understand relational dynamics, but recognizing broader patterns? Sometimes that feels like it could become an excuse for not taking personal responsibility, you know? \"It's the system, not me\" kind of thing. Though I guess if I'm being honest, that's probably my own resistance talking - I mean, I've definitely blamed \"the industry\" or \"jealous people\" when things went wrong instead of looking at my part.",
  "user7": "Want to do the reflection questions, or are you complete for today?",
  "system8": "I'm actually really curious about those reflection questions - I feel like I'm starting to get why my therapist thought this process would be helpful before the ceremony. There's clearly more here than I initially thought, and I want to make sure I'm approaching this with the right mindset, not just... well, not just thinking about how to leverage it for my image. So yeah, let's do the questions.",
  "user8": "Take your time with this.\n\nWhen you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system9": "When I think of healing, honestly? I picture someone looking peaceful and radiant, like they've transcended whatever was bothering them. Which I realize probably sounds like Instagram-bait rather than something real, but that's what comes up. I assume it's about getting to a place where things don't hurt anymore, where you're \"above\" the drama and pain. Though hearing you talk about integration, I guess I'm starting to see that's probably a limited view - like I've been thinking of healing as arriving somewhere better rather than becoming more whole with everything that's already here.",
  "user9": "I hear that. Instagram-bait but that's what surfaces. Getting above rather than becoming whole with what's here.\n\nWhere do you feel that in your body when you think about healing?",
  "system10": "Honestly? I feel it right in my chest - like this tightness that either means I'm about to get something really good, or lose something I can't afford to lose. It's the same feeling I get before a big pitch meeting or when I'm about to walk into an event where I need to work the room perfectly. Like my body's preparing for performance, not peace. Though now that I'm sitting with it, there's something exhausting about that too - like underneath the adrenaline, there's this low-level hum of \"don't mess this up.\"",
  "user10": "Chest tightness. Performance energy. Don't mess this up underneath it all.\n\nThis one has two parts.\n\nHow has your life taught you to see healing as fixing?\nWhere has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system11": "My life has definitely taught me that healing equals fixing - like, growing up, anything \"wrong\" with me was something to correct so I could be more impressive. Bad grades? Get tutoring to fix them. Not popular enough? Fix my image, fix my social strategy. Even therapy felt like a performance - like \"look how well I'm doing the work\" so people would see me as evolved rather than actually evolving.\n\nThat perspective has been helpful in some ways - I'm incredibly strategic about improvement, and I can pivot quickly when something's not working. But it's also totally limited me because I never actually feel anything. I just optimize around it. Like with my relationships that fell apart - I was so focused on fixing the optics of what happened that I never actually processed losing people who mattered to me. I just moved on to the next thing, telling myself they were too sensitive anyway.",
  "user11": "Strategic about improvement, pivot quickly. But never actually feel - just optimize around it.\n\nRelationships fell apart and you moved on, telling yourself they were too sensitive.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system12": "Right now? Wholeness feels like this foreign concept - like, I've spent so long being whoever people need me to be that I can't even picture what it would mean to just... be complete as-is. I guess intellectually I understand it's about integrating all the parts of myself, but honestly that sounds terrifying. Like, which version of me would even be left if I stopped performing? Though there's something exhausting about constantly managing which version people see - maybe wholeness would mean not having to think about it anymore?",
  "user12": "Foreign concept. Which version would be left if you stopped performing?\n\nWhen have you felt closest to that? Even for a moment?",
  "system13": "Honestly? There was this moment last year, right after everything collapsed with the lawsuit, when I was sitting alone in my apartment and realized there was literally no one left to impress. Everyone had either turned on me or I'd pushed them away. And for like thirty seconds, I felt this weird... relief? Like I could just exist without calculating my next move. But then the panic hit about being irrelevant, and I was right back to strategizing how to rebuild.",
  "user13": "Thirty seconds of relief when there was no one left to impress. Then panic about being irrelevant.\n\nCan you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?",
  "system14": "You know what\u2019s coming up? This one evening, maybe six months ago, I\u2019d been ghosted by a potential client and felt that old \u201cyou\u2019re nothing\u201d spiral starting. Instead of numbing out on Instagram or calling someone for a quick ego boost, I just sat on my balcony with this cheap grocery-store candle and let the awfulness be there. I didn\u2019t rebrand it, didn\u2019t text anyone, didn\u2019t turn it into content\u2014just let the shame pulse. I still felt like crap, but there was a tiny sense that the feeling and I could occupy the same space without one of us needing to be deleted. That\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve tasted to \u201cwhole\u201d while the mess was still live.",
  "user14": "Cheap candle on the balcony. Let the shame pulse without turning it into content. You and the feeling in the same space.\n\nThank you for exploring these questions. I can hear the exhaustion of constant performance and the relief when you stop managing the optics.\n\nI've captured this on your dashboard. A snapshot of where you are right now.\n\nYou did meaningful work today. Need anything before we close?",
  "system15": "I appreciate that - it actually feels... grounding? Like maybe there's something here beyond just another performance. I'm curious though, and between you and me, do you think my therapist will actually see the difference when I show up next week? Or will she keep pushing that whole \"you need to feel more\" thing? I mean, I get it intellectually, but sometimes I wonder if she's waiting for some big emotional breakthrough that's just not how I'm wired.",
  "user15": "I hear the question about whether she'll see the difference. That's between you and her.\n\nYou've shown me you can feel - just not in the dramatic way people expect. You sat with shame on that balcony without turning it into content. That's real.\n\nWhat matters is you noticing your own shift, not whether she validates it.",
  "system16": "That lands in a weirdly relieving way\u2014like I can stop auditioning my growth for an audience of one. I\u2019ll probably still catch myself trying to package the balcony moment into proof I\u2019m \u201cdoing the work,\u201d but at least now I notice the packaging instinct while it\u2019s happening. That\u2019s\u2026 something.",
  "user16": "Noticing the packaging while you're doing it. That's a different kind of awareness than trying to fix the packaging.\n\nThat's the work - not the breakthrough people sell you.\n\nYou good to close here?",
  "system17": "Yeah, I\u2019m good\u2014this actually feels like a decent stopping point. Thanks for not forcing the big emotional finale; that would\u2019ve been pure theater and we both know it. I\u2019ll take the small, inconvenient awareness over the curated breakthrough any day.",
  "user17": "Small, inconvenient awareness over curated breakthrough. I hear that.\n\nTake care of yourself today.",
  "system18": "Honestly, I appreciate that. I'll probably just grab an overpriced latte and let myself exist without turning it into a story\u2014at least for a few minutes.",
  "user18": "Overpriced latte without a story. Good place to land.\n\nTalk soon.",
  "system19": "For sure. Thanks for holding space without needing the performance\u2014it's... different.",
  "user19": "Different is right. \n\nYou're welcome."
