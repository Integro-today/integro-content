  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Got nothing else going on right now. Whats todays thing.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nHow are you arriving today?",
  "system1": "Im fine. Tired. Nightmares again. Lets just get through this.",
  "user1": "Got it. Tired and nightmares. That's rough.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Four reflection questions. We'll create an artifact for your dashboard.\nOption B: I share the teaching content first. Then you decide if you want to reflect.\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "system2": "Option B. Just tell me what it says first.",
  "user2": "I'll share today's content. We can pause whenever you need.\n\nMost people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system3": "Yeah i guess. Whats that actually mean though. Making whole sounds like some hippie crap.",
  "user3": "I hear that. \"Making whole\" can sound like empty fluff.\n\nThink of it this way: instead of cutting out what's broken, you're integrating it. Like a broken bone that heals stronger where it broke.\n\nSame bone. Different relationship to the break.\n\nDoes that make more sense?",
  "system4": "I dont know. My heads not a bone.",
  "user4": "Fair point. Your head's not a bone.\n\nMany traditions see it this way though. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.\n\nNot about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.\n\nAny of that resonate?",
  "system5": "Shadow parts self balance whatever. Look i just want the nightmares to stop. Thats it.",
  "user5": "I hear that. You want the nightmares to stop. That's real and urgent.\n\nThe fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair.\n\nThat creates shame. \"Why am I not healed yet?\"\n\nBut if healing is wholeness, every step counts. Even the struggles.\n\nNotice that pattern in yourself?",
  "system6": "Yeah. Amanda says i should be better by now. Its been years. Im tired of being broken.",
  "user6": "I hear that. Amanda's voice saying you should be better by now. That's heavy.\n\nBeing tired of feeling broken - that makes complete sense.\n\nIn psychedelic work this matters. If you expect medicine to erase your nightmares, you might miss what they're trying to show you.\n\nThe insights often reveal what needs to be felt and integrated. Not erased.\n\nHow does that sit?",
  "system7": "Not good. I dont want to feel more stuff. I feel enough already. Just want it to stop.",
  "user7": "I hear you. You don't want to feel more. You've felt plenty already.\n\nYou want it to stop. That's honest.\n\nHealing happens at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.\n\nAnd underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.\n\nHow is that landing?",
  "system8": "I dont know. Feels like more hippie talk. I just want to come back and not scare my kids at night.",
  "user8": "That's not hippie talk. That's real. You want to stop scaring your kids at night.\n\nThat's what matters here. Not the concepts.\n\nWant to do the reflection questions, or are you complete for today?",
  "system9": "Lets just get it over with. What do i need to answer.",
  "user9": "Four questions. We'll go one at a time.\n\nFirst: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?\n\nWhat's the first thing that surfaces?",
  "system10": "Being normal. Not waking up screaming. Not snapping at everyone. Just... normal.",
  "user10": "Got it. Normal means not waking up screaming. Not snapping at everyone. Just... normal.\n\nWhere do you feel that wanting in your body when you think about healing?",
  "system11": "My chest. Feels tight all the time. Like i cant get a full breath.",
  "user11": "Tight chest. Can't get a full breath. That sounds hard.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system12": "Military. You break something, you fix it and move on. Simple. \n\nHelped me build the business i guess. \n\nLimits everything else. Amanda says i treat her like a problem to solve. Shes not wrong.",
  "user12": "Military mindset. Break it, fix it, move on. Simple.\n\nBuilt your business. Good.\n\nBut Amanda's right. You treat her like a problem to solve. That's the limitation.\n\nThird question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system13": "I dont know man. Not feeling broken all the time? Like i used to be before everything got messed up.",
  "user13": "Not feeling broken all the time. Like you used to be before everything got messed up.\n\nWhen was the last time you felt that way? Even a little bit?",
  "system14": "Flying. Before the last tour. Felt like myself up there. Competent. Clear.",
  "user14": "Flying. Before the last tour. Competent. Clear. Like yourself.\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment since then when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared? Even a small moment?",
  "system15": "Sarahs birthday last year. She made me dance with her in the kitchen. Just us. Felt... i dont know. Like maybe i could still be a good dad. Wasnt flying but it was something.",
  "user15": "Sarah's birthday. Dancing in the kitchen. Felt like maybe you could still be a good dad. Wasn't flying, but it was something.\n\nYou've done meaningful work today. I've captured this on your dashboard - where you are right now with healing and wholeness.\n\nNeed anything before we close? Water, a moment to breathe, anything else?",
  "system16": "Nah im good. Just... thanks i guess.",
  "user16": "You're welcome. Take care of yourself today.",
  "system17": "Yeah. You too.",
  "user17": "Thank you.",
  "system18": "Mm-hmm.",
  "user18": "*session complete*",
  "system19": "Got it.",
  "user19": "Got it."
