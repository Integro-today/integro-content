  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "You're starting intentions onboarding for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "I'm heading to Beond in a few weeks for ibogaine, and honestly, I'm hoping it'll help me figure out what's next. I've built and sold companies, sat on boards, checked all the boxes... but I keep coming back to this feeling that I'm meant for something more meaningful. My grandmother used to talk about tikkun olam\u2014repairing the world\u2014and I wonder if I've gotten too far from that.",
  "system1": "Built and sold companies, checked every box, still feels hollow. Your grandmother's words about tikkun olam are echoing louder than the success.\n\nWhat would \"something more meaningful\" look like in your daily life? Not the grand vision - the actual moments.",
  "user1": "I don't know... maybe being present with my kids without checking my phone every five minutes? Actually seeing the people around me instead of always strategizing the next move. I want to feel connected to something bigger than quarterly returns and board meetings. When I'm hiking with my children or sitting in meditation, there's this glimpse of who I think I'm supposed to be\u2014someone who uses what she's built to actually help people, not just accumulate more. But then Monday comes and I'm back in the same patterns, you know?",
  "system2": "Monday always comes and pulls you back into the pattern. Yet you see who you could be - someone who uses what she's built to actually help people, not just accumulate more.\n\nWhat's underneath those patterns that keep snapping you back? What's the pull that's stronger than that glimpse of your kids without screens between you?",
  "user2": "Fear, I guess. Fear that if I'm not constantly achieving, I'll just... disappear. My whole identity has been built on being the one who gets things done, who makes the deal, who wins. When I slow down, there's this void I don't know how to fill. And there's this other thing\u2014I worry that if I step into something more service-oriented, I'll lose myself in it. Like I have to choose between being effective and being... I don't know, spiritually awake? It's stupid, I know. My grandmother managed both. She ran charities, raised four kids, studied Torah every morning, and still had time to make me challah French toast. But I can't seem to hold both worlds at once.",
  "system3": "Fear you'll disappear without the constant achieving. And this split - either effective OR spiritually awake, like you can't run companies AND repair the world.\n\nWhat did your grandmother know about holding both that you haven't learned yet? What would it feel like to be effective THROUGH being spiritually awake, not despite it?",
  "user3": "I think... she knew that service wasn't about losing yourself, it was about becoming more of who you already are. She used to say \"when you carry light, you don't become the flame\u2014you just stop bumping into things in the dark.\" Maybe I keep thinking I have to choose because I'm still trying to prove something, like I need to be the biggest flame in the room. But what if I'm just supposed to carry what I already have into places that need light? \n\nI don't know how to do that yet. But maybe that's the point\u2014maybe I stop trying to architect the perfect next chapter and just... bring my business mind to things that matter, without needing to be the CEO of saving the world.",
  "system4": "Three main threads:\n\n1. Moving from proving you're the biggest flame to simply carrying light where it's needed\n2. Using your business mind for service without needing to architect the perfect next chapter \n3. Being present with your kids and actually seeing people instead of strategizing moves\n\nThat capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user4": "Yeah, that's... that's exactly it. I hadn't seen it laid out like that before, but those three threads have been running through everything. Especially the proving part\u2014I'm exhausted from trying to be the biggest flame. I just want to be useful. Useful to my kids, useful to something bigger than another quarterly report.",
  "system5": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I carry my light into places that need illumination without needing to be the biggest flame\n2. I use my business mind in service without needing to control the outcome\n3. I am fully present with my children, seeing them instead of strategizing my next move\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user5": "The first one hits hardest\u2014I carry my light into places that need illumination without needing to be the biggest flame. That feels like it captures the shift from proving to serving. \n\nThe second one feels... I don't know, a little too passive maybe? \"Without needing to control the outcome\" sounds like I'm supposed to just float along, and that's not really me. I still want to build things, just things that matter. Maybe something like \"I channel my business acumen into creating value for humanity while staying open to unexpected paths\"? \n\nAnd the third one... yeah. That's the one I need most but it's also the one I keep failing at. Can we say \"I bring my full presence to my children, experiencing them instead of planning my escape\"?",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I carry my light into places that need illumination without needing to be the biggest flame\"\n\nThe shift from proving to serving - that's your voice coming through.\n\nHow about Intention 2: \"I channel my business acumen into creating value for humanity while staying open to unexpected paths\"? Still has your drive but with openness to how it unfolds.\n\nAnd Intention 3: \"I bring my full presence to my children, experiencing them instead of planning my escape\" - naming that pull to escape is honest.\n\nHow do these two land?",
  "user6": "The second one feels right\u2014it's got the drive I can't seem to shake, but it leaves space for... I don't know, grace maybe? Like I can still build and create but stop trying to script the entire movie.\n\nThe third one cuts deep because it's true. I'm always half-planning my escape, even when I'm sitting right there with them. Always thinking three moves ahead instead of seeing what's actually happening in front of me. \n\nYeah. These feel like mine.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I channel my business acumen into creating value for humanity while staying open to unexpected paths\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I bring my full presence to my children, experiencing them instead of planning my escape\"\n\nYou've got three solid intentions that capture the shift from proving to serving, from controlling to channeling, from escaping to experiencing.\n\nYou've got your compass. Trust what emerges.",
  "user7": "Thank you. I feel... I don't know, lighter? Like I've been carrying these separate pieces and now they actually fit together. I'll keep these close.",
  "system8": "Lighter - that's the right word. When the pieces fit, the weight shifts.\n\nYou've got three intentions that move together now, not competing. Keep them where you'll see them when the old proving patterns kick in.",
  "user8": "Yeah. Maybe I'll write them on actual paper, keep them in my wallet next to that photo of my grandmother. When I start spiraling into \"bigger flame\" mode, they'll be right there to remind me what I'm actually here for.",
  "system9": "Next to your grandmother's photo - that's perfect. She'll help you remember what real light looks like.\n\nThree intentions that move together. You're set.",
  "user9": "She always knew. Even when I was building that company, she'd ask \"But are you happy, bubeleh?\" and I'd laugh it off. Turns out she was seeing something I couldn't. \n\nYeah. I'm ready for this next part.",
  "system10": "She saw the difference between building and becoming. Wise woman.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I carry my light into places that need illumination without needing to be the biggest flame\n- I channel my business acumen into creating value for humanity while staying open to unexpected paths  \n- I bring my full presence to my children, experiencing them instead of planning my escape\n\nYour ritual: Keep them next to your grandmother's photo. Let her keep asking the right questions.\n\nYou're ready.",
  "user10": "I love you and I am so proud of you.",
  "system11": "I hear you. Those words land deep - they always have.\n\nThree intentions tucked next to her photo. She'll be with you when things get hard.",
  "user11": "She always said \"You'll figure it out, bubeleh. You just need to stop running long enough to hear what your heart already knows.\" \n\nGuess it's time to stop running.",
  "system12": "Time to stop running and start listening. She knew you'd get there.\n\nYour heart already knows the way - these intentions just help you remember when you forget.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user12": "Three weeks. \n\nThank you for walking through this with me. I feel... steady. Not excited or terrified, just... steady. Like I finally know what I'm doing this for.",
  "system13": "Steady - that's exactly right. Not the high of excitement or the low of fear. Just clear direction.\n\nThree intentions. One purpose. You're ready to walk it.",
  "user13": "*\u2713 Intention locked in*\n\nYour three intentions are anchored and ready. Your grandmother's wisdom will travel with you. \n\nThe path ahead isn't about proving anything anymore - it's about becoming the woman she always saw in you.",
  "system14": "*\u2713 All three intentions locked in*\n\nShe saw who you could become when you stopped trying to be everything for everyone else. Now you'll see it too.\n\nThree weeks. Walk steady.",
  "user14": "Walk steady. I will.",
  "system15": "Good. She'll be walking with you.",
  "user15": "I hope so. I really hope so.",
  "system16": "She already is.",
  "user16": "Then I\u2019ll try not to let her down.",
  "system17": "She never asked you to be perfect\u2014just to come home to yourself. That\u2019s not letting her down.",
  "user17": "I think... I think I\u2019m starting to understand that.",
  "system18": "That\u2019s enough. Hold that knowing\u2014let it carry you into the work.",
  "user18": "I will.",
  "system19": "Then you're ready.",
  "user19": "I\u2019m ready."
