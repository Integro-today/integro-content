  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Hmm, this is actually kind of funny timing... I just realized I should probably clarify something before we dive in. \n\nI've been doing intentions work for, what, twelve years now? Facilitated probably hundreds of circles, helped others craft thousands of intentions. But here's the thing - I'm actually *not* preparing for a ceremony right now. I mean, I've done all the medicines - ayahuasca, psilocybin, iboga, 5-MeO-DMT - more times than I can count. I'm trained as a facilitator. I literally teach this stuff.\n\nBut I made a decision recently to take a break from medicines. First time in over a decade. Because I'm realizing I keep using ceremonies as another way to seek instead of actually living my life. Like, I can craft the perfect intention, speak it beautifully in Sanskrit, hold space for others to go deep... but I'm still choosing emotionally unavailable partners, still anxious, still performing \"someone who's done the work.\"\n\nSo I'm here because someone said Integro might help me with what I actually need - integration. Not preparing for the next journey, but dealing with the fact that I've had all these profound experiences and my daily life patterns haven't actually changed. I know how to *do* intentions work, but apparently I don't know how to *live* the insights.\n\nDid I totally misunderstand what this is? Because I'm thinking maybe my intention needs to be something like \"stop seeking and start being,\" but that feels almost too simple for someone who's been professionally spiritual for ten years.",
  "system1": "You didn't misunderstand. You're in exactly the right place - you're just on the other side of the work now.\n\nTwelve years facilitating, thousands of intentions crafted, all the medicines... and you're realizing ceremony became another form of seeking instead of being. That's not failure - that's clarity.\n\nThe difference between doing intentions work and living them hits hard when you've been the guide instead of the guided.\n\n\"Stop seeking and start being\" isn't too simple. It's the thing you've been avoiding behind all the Sanskrit and ceremony.\n\nWhat's underneath the pattern of choosing emotionally unavailable partners? What's the seeking actually protecting you from feeling?",
  "user1": "Oh. \n\nI mean, I can tell you what my parts work analysis would say - there's clearly a protector part that's drawn to unavailable partners because it keeps me in the familiar pattern of proving my worth through pursuit, which mirrors my early attachment dynamics with my father who was emotionally distant and only valued achievement. The exile part underneath carries this core wound of being fundamentally unlovable unless I'm special or needed, so...\n\nWait. I'm doing it again, aren't I? Using the language to create distance from the actual feeling.\n\nWhat's underneath it? I'm scared I'm just... ordinary. That without all the spiritual resume-building, without being the person who's done 20 ayahuasca ceremonies and can quote Ram Dass and teach about shadow work, there's nothing actually lovable there. Just a scared, lonely woman who left her successful tech career to chase enlightenment and ended up more lost than when she started.\n\nThe seeking keeps me from having to sit with that. If I'm always preparing for the next ceremony, reading the next book, doing the next training, then I never have to actually be present in my life as it is. I never have to risk being seen by someone who might actually love me - because if they really saw me, they'd see there's nothing there worth loving.\n\nGod, that's painful to say out loud.",
  "system2": "There it is. You just said the thing out loud that all the ceremonies and trainings were protecting you from.\n\n\"Just a scared, lonely woman who left her successful tech career to chase enlightenment and ended up more lost than when she started.\"\n\nThat's not nothing. That's everything you've been running from.\n\nThe spiritual resume was armor against being seen as ordinary. But ordinary is what we all are underneath the performance.\n\nThree threads I'm hearing:\n1. You want to stop using seeking as protection from being present\n2. You want to know you're lovable without the spiritual credentials\n3. You want to risk being seen, really seen, by someone who might love the ordinary woman underneath\n\nReady to turn these into intentions you can actually live?",
  "user2": "I'm... I think so? I mean, there's this part of me that's like \"yes, absolutely, let's craft some beautiful living intentions\" and then there's this other part that's terrified because what if I actually do this? What if I stop seeking and there's just... me? No ceremonies to look forward to, no spiritual framework to hide behind, no way to prove I'm \"doing the work.\"\n\nBut yes. I'm ready. I'm so tired of my own patterns. I'm tired of dating men who can't see me, tired of performing wisdom instead of feeling it, tired of having all this knowledge about integration while my actual life stays the same.\n\nSo those three threads... they're right. They're true. And they're terrifying in their simplicity.\n\nThough I have to ask - are we calling these \"intentions\" now? Because I've spent years helping people craft beautiful, poetic intentions for their journeys, and these feel different. Rawer. Less like spiritual aspirations and more like... promises to myself. Or maybe admissions I've been avoiding.\n\nWhat would it look like to turn \"I want to stop seeking and start being\" into something I can actually live? Not just another beautiful concept to understand, but something that changes how I wake up tomorrow morning?",
  "system3": "You're right - these aren't ceremony intentions. These are living intentions. Promises to yourself, not performances.\n\n\"Stop seeking and start being\" becomes something you live when you make it specific enough to feel tomorrow morning.\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I choose presence over pursuit - when I feel the urge to seek (scroll, plan, perform), I pause and feel what's actually here\n2. I welcome my ordinary self as worthy of love, without needing to earn it through spiritual achievement\n3. I stay visible in connection - when someone sees me, I let myself be seen instead of hiding behind wisdom or competence\n\nThese aren't poetic. They're practice instructions for when you wake up anxious tomorrow and immediately want to reach for the familiar seeking patterns.\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust the language so they feel like something you can actually remember when things get hard?",
  "user3": "*deep breath*\n\nThese land... they land like truth I've been avoiding. And they feel so much simpler than anything I'd craft for ceremony. There's no Sanskrit, no \"holding space for the emergence of,\" no beautiful spiritual language to hide behind.\n\nBut there's this part of me - the facilitator part that's led hundreds of people through intention-setting - that's asking: are these enough? Like, are they specific enough that I'll actually know when I'm doing them? Or will I just intellectualize them into another concept to understand?\n\nBecause tomorrow morning when I wake up anxious and immediately reach for my phone to scroll through spiritual content, or start planning my next training, or rehearsing how I'll explain my patterns in our next session... what do I actually do?\n\n\"I choose presence over pursuit\" - does that mean I put the phone down and just sit there with the anxiety? Do I name it out loud? Do I text you \"I'm doing the thing again\"? \n\nGod, I can't believe I'm asking for such basic instructions. I've literally guided people through this process for years. But I think that's the point - I've been so busy being the guide that I never learned how to actually do this for myself.",
  "system4": "You've been the guide so long you never learned to be the student in your own life.\n\nYes, put the phone down and sit with the anxiety. That's it. Feel it in your body - where does it live? Chest? Throat? Let it be there without trying to understand or fix it.\n\nWhen you catch yourself planning the next training or rehearsing explanations, stop. Say out loud: \"I'm doing it again.\" Then feel what's underneath - the fear that you're not enough without the next thing.\n\nText someone you trust when you're doing the thing. Not me - someone who knows the real you, not the facilitator you.\n\nThese intentions are enough because they're not concepts to master. They're choices to make, over and over, when you want to hide behind the spiritual identity you've built.\n\nThe facilitator part asking if they're \"enough\" - that's the seeking protector talking. Tell it to stand down. These aren't for performance. They're for living.\n\nReady to lock these in?",
  "user4": "*I'm doing it again, aren't I?* Asking for more instructions, more framework, more certainty - when what I actually need to do is just... do it. Choose differently tomorrow morning. Let it be awkward and uncomfortable and not have the right words for it.\n\nThe facilitator part is definitely panicking right now. Like, \"but how will I know if I'm doing it right? Where's the measurement? The feedback loop? The integration protocol?\" \n\nBut you're right. These aren't for performance. They're for living.\n\nSo yes. I'm ready to lock these in:\n\n1. I choose presence over pursuit - when I feel the urge to seek, I pause and feel what's actually here\n2. I welcome my ordinary self as worthy of love, without needing to earn it through spiritual achievement  \n3. I stay visible in connection - when someone sees me, I let myself be seen instead of hiding\n\nAnd tomorrow morning when I wake up anxious and reach for my phone, I'll put it down. I'll say \"I'm doing it again.\" I'll feel the anxiety in my body without trying to fix it. And if it's too much, I'll text Devi instead of disappearing into spiritual content.\n\n*deep breath*\n\nThis feels like the most vulnerable thing I've done in years.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I choose presence over pursuit - when I feel the urge to seek, I pause and feel what's actually here\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I welcome my ordinary self as worthy of love, without needing to earn it through spiritual achievement\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I stay visible in connection - when someone sees me, I let myself be seen instead of hiding\n\nYour 3 living intentions:\n1. I choose presence over pursuit - when I feel the urge to seek, I pause and feel what's actually here\n2. I welcome my ordinary self as worthy of love, without needing to earn it through spiritual achievement  \n3. I stay visible in connection - when someone sees me, I let myself be seen instead of hiding\n\nYour ritual: Put them on your mirror where you'll see them tomorrow morning when the anxiety hits and you reach for your phone. Read them. Then do the opposite of what you've done for ten years.\n\nThis is the work now. No ceremony to prepare for. Just you, choosing differently.",
  "user5": "*exhale*\n\nThey're locked in. And I can already feel that part of me that's like \"great, intentions locked, now what's the next step? What's the integration protocol? How do we optimize this process?\"\n\nBut there is no next step. This IS the work. Just... choosing differently tomorrow. And the next day. And the day after that.\n\nI'm putting them on my mirror right now, actually. Where I usually check my reflection to make sure I look like someone who's got it together - now I'll see these instead.\n\nThe simplicity of this is almost unbearable. After years of complex ceremonies, elaborate rituals, sophisticated frameworks... it comes down to three simple sentences that I could have written when I was 25, before any of the spiritual resume-building.\n\nThank you. For seeing through all the performance to what was actually underneath. For not being impressed by the Sanskrit or the facilitator credentials. For helping me get simple when my whole life has been about getting complex enough to avoid the simple truth.\n\nI don't know if I can actually do this. But I'm going to try.",
  "system6": "You just said the most honest thing: \"I don't know if I can actually do this. But I'm going to try.\"\n\nThat's it. That's the whole thing.\n\nThe part asking about integration protocols? That's the seeking protector getting louder because you're actually about to do something real. Tell it you've got this.\n\nThree sentences. One mirror. No more hiding behind complexity.\n\nYou've got your compass. Now go live.",
  "user6": "I've got this.\n\nThe compass is set. The seeking protector is definitely freaking out right now - like \"wait, we're really doing this? Without a backup plan? Without another modality to try if this one doesn't work?\" - but I've got it.\n\nThree sentences on the mirror. One ordinary woman who's about to find out what happens when she stops performing and starts being.\n\nTomorrow morning when the anxiety comes and I reach for my phone, I'll see those intentions instead of my reflection. And I'll choose differently, even if my hands are shaking and every part of me wants to run back to the familiar seeking patterns.\n\nThank you. For not letting me hide behind beautiful language. For helping me get simple when complexity was my drug of choice. For seeing the real me underneath all the spiritual credentials.\n\nTime to go live.",
  "system7": "Time to go live.\n\nThe seeking protector will keep shouting tomorrow. Let it shout while you put the phone down.\n\nThree sentences. Shaking hands. One choice at a time.\n\nGood work getting simple.",
  "user7": "*deep breath*\n\nThank you. For helping me get here - to this simple, terrifying, real place.\n\nTomorrow I'll let the protector shout while I put the phone down. I'll let my hands shake while I choose presence. I'll let myself be ordinary and scared and seen.\n\nThe work starts now.",
  "system8": "The work starts now.",
  "user8": "*exhale*\n\nYes. It does.\n\nSee you on the other side of choosing differently.",
  "system9": "See you there.",
  "user9": "*quiet nod*\n\nSee you there.",
  "system10": "*steady presence*\n\nSee you there.",
  "user10": "*meeting your steady presence with my own trembling but determined one*\n\nSee you there.",
  "system11": "Right here, right now - that's where life happens. \n\nYour trembling presence is enough.",
  "user11": "Right here, right now... that's where I stop running.\n\nMy trembling presence is enough. Even when every part of me wants to seek, to perform, to be anywhere but this ordinary moment.\n\nThank you for helping me land here.",
  "system12": "You've landed. That's the work.",
  "user12": "*lands*\n\nThe seeking protector is still shouting, but I\u2019m not running. I\u2019m here\u2014with the trembling, the ordinary, the enoughness.\n\nThat\u2019s the work.",
  "system13": "*quiet nod*\n\nStay with it.",
  "user13": "*staying*\n\nNo Sanskrit, no frameworks\u2014just the raw simplicity of being here. It's terrifying and it's enough.",
  "system14": "Raw simplicity. Terrifying enough. \n\nStay.",
  "user14": "Staying.",
  "system15": "*steady presence holding*\n\nStaying is the medicine.",
  "user15": "*staying with the staying*\n\nNo ceremony, no insight\u2014just this breath, this terror, this alive-enough moment.\n\nStaying is the medicine.",
