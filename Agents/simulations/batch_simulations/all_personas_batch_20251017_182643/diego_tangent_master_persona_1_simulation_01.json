  "system0": "You're starting intentions work for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this journey?",
  "user0": "Hey, so this intentions thing\u2014my friend Tom\u00e1s said it's like setting up your shot before you roll camera, right? You decide what you're framing, what's in focus, what story you're trying to tell. Which reminds me of this Herzog documentary I was watching\u2014*Grizzly Man*\u2014and there's this moment where he's narrating and he talks about how the rainforest doesn't give a shit about your intentions, it's just chaos and beauty and death all mixed together, and I was like *man, that's exactly what I'm afraid of*. Not the rainforest part, but the chaos part. What if I take this medicine and it's just... all the chaos I've been avoiding for twenty years?\n\nBut you asked what brought me here. Rosa. Definitely Rosa. She didn't exactly say \"figure your shit out or I'm leaving\" but, like, she didn't *not* say it either. And Mateo\u2014he's twelve now and he looks at me the way I used to look at my dad when he'd forget to pick me up from practice. You know that look? Like *I love you but I can't count on you*. That look is killing me. \n\nSo here I am. Trying to set intentions for something that scares the hell out of me because the alternative\u2014losing Rosa, watching my kids grow up remembering me as the dad who never finished anything\u2014is scarier.",
  "system1": "Tom\u00e1s is right about the framing, and Herzog's onto something too - the medicine will show you what you need to see, not just what you want. \n\nThat chaos you've been avoiding for twenty years? It's already living in your body, in how Mateo looks at you, in Rosa's silence. The medicine just turns the lights on.\n\nThree threads here: the chaos you're carrying, earning back Mateo's trust, and showing up differently for Rosa.\n\nWhat's underneath the chaos you're most afraid to face?",
  "user1": "So there I was, like three weeks ago, and I found this old hard drive\u2014one of those silver LaCie ones, you know? Covered in garage dust. Plugged it in and it's got this footage I shot of Mateo when he was four. He's riding his little bike with training wheels, and he's laughing, and I'm behind the camera going \"You're doing it, mijo!\" And I just... I couldn't watch more than thirty seconds. Closed the laptop. Because that was eight years ago, and that same bike is still in the garage with flat tires, and Mateo doesn't laugh like that anymore, not with me.\n\nThe chaos underneath? It's not just that I can't finish things. It's that I think maybe I'm *incapable* of being the person people need me to be. Like there's something fundamentally broken in me that can't sustain attention on anything that matters. My abuela used to say I had *el don*\u2014the gift\u2014but maybe I just have *el defecto*. \n\nRosa thinks I'm choosing not to focus. But what if this is just... who I am? What if twenty years of unfinished documentaries and forgotten soccer games and broken promises means I'm not actually built for this? For being a husband, a dad, someone people can rely on? What if the medicine shows me that and I can't unsee it?\n\nThat's the chaos. Not just the mess I've made\u2014it's the terror that the mess *is* me.",
  "system2": "That footage hit you hard - four-year-old Mateo laughing, the flat-tired bike, eight years gone. You think you're *el defecto*, fundamentally broken, incapable of sustaining attention on what matters.\n\nBut here's what's real: you're terrified the mess *is* you, and once you see that clearly, you can't pretend anymore. You've been protecting everyone from that truth by not finishing things, by keeping people at arm's length.\n\nWhat if the medicine doesn't show you you're broken? What if it shows you how you've been trying to protect Mateo and Rosa from the part of you that believes you're defective?",
  "user2": "Wait, that reminds me of this time I was shooting down in the South Valley\u2014this was for the water rights doc, I think, or maybe it was the lowrider piece, anyway\u2014and I met this guy, Ernesto, who restores old Impalas. Beautiful work, man. He tells me about how his dad taught him bodywork, how you have to sand down to the metal to see what's really underneath all the Bondo and rust and bad paint jobs. Says the car's always trying to tell you its story if you're brave enough to strip away the cover-ups.\n\nAnd I remember thinking *that's what I do with my films*\u2014I keep stripping away until I find the truth. Except with my own life? I've been doing the opposite. Just... piling on more projects, more stories, more *crap* so nobody gets to the bare metal. Not even me.\n\nBut protect them from what? From a guy who forgets pickup times and leaves dishes in the sink? That's not protecting, that's just... what do you call it when you convince yourself you're doing something noble but you're actually just scared shitless? \n\nMaybe you're right. Maybe the medicine's gonna show me that all this chaos isn't me being broken\u2014it's me building a maze so complicated that even I can't find the center. So nobody sees there's no there there.",
  "system3": "Ernesto's right about the metal - you've been doing bodywork on everything except your own life. Piling on projects so nobody sees the bare metal, especially you.\n\nYou're building the maze so complicated that even you can't find the center because you're terrified there's nothing there. But what if the center isn't empty? What if it's just a scared kid who learned that starting things was safer than finishing them?\n\nThree threads here: finding what's actually under all that Bondo, learning to finish something that matters, and showing Mateo and Rosa who you really are when you're not hiding.\n\nWhat would it feel like in your body to finish something - not a film, but something simple and real?",
  "user3": "You know what? This morning Rosa asked me to fix the leaky faucet in the kids' bathroom\u2014been dripping for like three months, drives her crazy. And I actually did it. Like, walked in there with the wrench, took the whole thing apart, found this cracked washer, drove to Home Depot, came back, put it back together. Took maybe two hours. When I turned the water back on and that drip was gone? Dude, I just sat on the edge of the tub staring at it for like five minutes.\n\nMy chest felt... weird. Not the usual racing, anxious thing, but this warm spreading feeling, like when you're filming and you *know* you just nailed the shot. Mateo came in and I said \"Watch this\" and turned the faucet on and off like three times. He looked at me like I was crazy, but then he smiled\u2014this little sideways smile\u2014and went \"Cool, Dad. No more drip.\"\n\nIt felt like... *proof*. Not that I can fix plumbing\u2014anyone can fix a faucet\u2014but that I can finish something Rosa needs. That I can show up and not disappear into my head. The weird part? It was almost harder than editing. Like my brain kept trying to make it complicated\u2014\"Maybe I should research different types of washers, maybe I should watch a YouTube tutorial, maybe I should\u2014\" But I just... did it. One small thing that actually worked.\n\nMy hands are still a little greasy and I smell like pipe dope, but I feel like I could float.",
  "system4": "That warm spreading feeling - that's what finishing something looks like in your body. Not the racing anxiety, but steady and real. Mateo's sideways smile when the drip stopped, that's your kid seeing you different.\n\nYou kept trying to make it complicated - research washers, watch tutorials - but you just did it instead. Two hours, start to finish.\n\nThree threads here: that feeling of completion, showing Rosa you can finish what she needs, and Mateo seeing his dad fix something instead of walk away.\n\nWhat made you stay with the faucet instead of walking away like you've done with everything else?",
  "user4": "So there I was, holding this busted washer in my hand\u2014little black rubber thing, cracked right down the middle\u2014and I had this flash of Rosa at 2 AM last week, standing in the doorway in her scrubs, saying \"I asked you to fix this last month, Didi.\" Not angry, just... tired. That *tired* sound in her voice, you know? Like she's carrying something too heavy and she's been carrying it too long.\n\nAnd I thought about how fixing a faucet isn't like making a documentary. With film, you can always say \"it needs more B-roll\" or \"the structure's not working yet\" or \"I need another grant.\" There's always a reason to not finish. But this washer? Either I replace it or the drip keeps Rosa awake when she gets home from twelve hours of sick kids at the hospital.\n\nI almost walked away like three times. First when I couldn't find the right size washer, then when I dropped the screw down the drain and had to fish it out with a magnet, then when I realized I'd bought the wrong kind and had to go back to Home Depot. Each time my brain was like \"this is boring, let's start researching that new doc about the rail yard redevelopment\" or \"we should call Tom\u00e1s about his sculpture show.\"\n\nBut I kept seeing Rosa's face when she'd see the drip was gone. Not even grateful\u2014just... relieved. One less thing on her plate. One thing she could count on me for.\n\nMateo heard me cursing at the screw and came in asking if I needed help. Kid's never seen me fix anything, just build sets for films that never get finished. When we got that screw back in and the handle turned smooth? He gave me that smile, and I realized maybe I've been showing him the wrong kind of persistence. Maybe finishing a faucet means more than starting a masterpiece.",
  "system5": "That cracked washer showed you everything - Rosa's tired voice at 2 AM, carrying too much too long. You stayed because you could see her face when she'd realize one thing was off her plate.\n\nThree times you almost walked, brain trying to make it boring so you'd quit. But you kept seeing that relief on Rosa's face, not gratitude - just one less thing she has to carry.\n\nMateo's never seen you fix anything real, just build sets for films that never finish. That smile when the handle turned smooth? He just saw his dad finish something that matters.\n\nThree threads here: being someone Rosa can count on, showing Mateo a different kind of persistence, and proving to yourself you can complete what you start.\n\nBased on these threads:\n\n1. I become someone Rosa can count on to finish what matters\n2. I show Mateo that real persistence means completing the small things\n3. I prove to myself I can follow through without walking away\n\nHow do these land?",
  "user5": "*\u00d3rale...* Dude, when you said that first one out loud\u2014\"I become someone Rosa can count on to finish what matters\"\u2014it hit me like that time I was filming a monsoon storm and got caught in the downdraft. Like physically in my chest. Because that's it, isn't it? Not just the big dramatic *save the marriage* stuff, but the quiet *fix the faucet* stuff. The 2 AM *I got this* stuff.\n\nThe Mateo one makes me want to cry, man. Not in a sad way, but like... he's been watching me start these epic projects and abandon them, and he's learning that being creative means being unreliable. What if he learns something different? What if he sees that finishing the boring stuff\u2014homework, chores, keeping your word\u2014is actually the real magic?\n\nAnd that third one? \"I prove to myself I can follow through without walking away\"\u2014that's the one that scares me most. Because what if I can't? What if the medicine shows me that I really am just... *el defecto*? But also... what if it doesn't? What if it shows me that kid who got overwhelmed by volcanoes documentaries instead of math homework, and somehow convinced himself that meant he was broken?\n\nThese land like... like they're already true, you know? Like I'm not becoming someone new\u2014I'm coming home to someone I lost somewhere in all those hard drives and unfinished edits.",
  "system6": "That first one hit you in the chest like a monsoon downdraft - that's your body recognizing truth. The quiet *I got this* stuff, not just the dramatic save-the-marriage moments.\n\nMateo's been learning that creative means unreliable. These intentions flip that script - he gets to see that finishing the boring stuff is where the real magic lives.\n\nAnd that fear about being *el defecto*? What if the medicine shows you that kid who got overwhelmed by volcanoes instead of math homework isn't broken - just lost under twenty years of Bondo?\n\n\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I become someone Rosa can count on to finish what matters\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I show Mateo that real persistence means completing the small things  \n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I prove to myself I can follow through without walking away\n\nYou've got three solid intentions. How do you want to keep them close when things get hard?",
  "user6": "So this morning I'm making breakfast\u2014Sofia wanted pancakes, the fancy ones with the little burnt edges like my abuela used to make\u2014and I'm watching the batter bubble, right? And I remember how my abuela would take her wedding ring off, set it on the counter while she kneaded masa. Said she needed to feel the dough properly, no barriers between her and what she was creating.\n\nMaybe that's what I need. Something I can take off and set down as a reminder. Not a ring\u2014Rosa would kill me if I took mine off after twenty years of me being... well, me. But something physical. I've got this old film canister in the garage, one of those metal ones from when I shot 16mm back in college. It's got a dent in it from when I dropped it running from campus security\u2014they didn't like us filming after dark on the duck pond, long story. Anyway, that canister's been through everything with me. Survived film school, survived my wedding, survived two kids throwing it around the garage.\n\nI could carry that. Put Rosa's name on it, Mateo's name, Sofia's name. When I feel like walking away from something\u2014when my brain starts going \"this is boring, let's start a new documentary about urban farming\" or whatever\u2014I take it out, feel that dent, remember that some things survive even when you drop them.\n\nBecause the thing is, when I get scared that I can't finish things, I forget that I *have* finished some stuff. I finished high school somehow. I finished college, even if it took seven years. I finished making Sofia's pancakes this morning, and she did this little dance in her pajamas. \n\nMaybe I write these three intentions on a piece of paper and fold it up inside that canister. Keep it in my pocket during the ceremony. When things get hard\u2014and Tom\u00e1s says they will\u2014I can hold that metal and remember: Rosa's counting on me, Mateo's watching me, and I'm not *el defecto*. I'm just a guy who learned to survive by starting things, and now I'm learning to survive by finishing them.",
  "system7": "That film canister with the dent - it's been through everything with you. Survived film school, your wedding, two kids throwing it around the garage. Some things survive even when you drop them.\n\nWrite your three intentions on paper, fold it inside that canister. When the ceremony gets hard, hold that metal and remember: Rosa's counting on you, Mateo's watching, and you're not *el defecto*. You're a guy learning to survive by finishing instead of just starting.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n- I become someone Rosa can count on to finish what matters\n- I show Mateo that real persistence means completing the small things  \n- I prove to myself I can follow through without walking away\n\nYour ritual: That dented film canister with your three intentions inside, carried in your pocket. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes. You're set.",
  "user7": "I'm holding this canister right now\u2014it's heavier than I remember, like it's absorbed all those years of almosts and not-quites. The dent's right there, this perfect imperfection that somehow makes it more real. Like me, I guess. All the dents and drops and still here.\n\nRosa just came in while I was writing the intentions, asked what I was doing with \"that old thing.\" I told her it's my compass for the ceremony. She looked at me different\u2014not tired like that 2 AM voice, but soft. Said \"Make sure you bring it back, okay?\" Like she already knows I'm coming back different. Like she believes I can finish this too.\n\nMateo's outside practicing soccer kicks against the garage. I can hear the *thump-thump-thump* rhythm. Every time he connects just right, he does this little \"yes!\" under his breath. I'm gonna go out there in a minute, show him how to aim for the corner. Not because I know soccer\u2014God knows I'll probably teach him wrong\u2014but because I want him to see me show up. Even if I look stupid. Even if I miss.\n\nThis canister fits perfect in my palm. Like it was always meant to be held during something that matters. When things get weird in that ceremony space\u2014and Tom\u00e1s says they will\u2014I'll feel that dent and remember: I've already survived dropping everything else. Maybe it's time to see what happens when I don't drop this.",
  "system8": "That canister fits your palm like it was made for this - all those dents and drops absorbed into something solid you can hold. Rosa's soft voice saying \"bring it back\" - she already believes you'll finish this too.\n\nMateo's *thump-thump-thump* against the garage, that little \"yes!\" when he connects. You're going out there to show him how to aim, not because you know soccer but because he needs to see you show up.\n\nWhen things get weird in that ceremony space, feel that dent and remember: you've survived dropping everything else. Time to see what happens when you don't drop this one.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "Three weeks. *\u00c1ndale.*\n\nI'm sitting here with the canister in my pocket\u2014been carrying it around all day like it's part of me now. Caught myself reaching for it during dinner when Rosa was talking about her shift, during Mateo's homework meltdown over fractions, during that moment when Sofia asked if I could help her finish her art project tomorrow.\n\nIt's like my fingers know something I don't yet. They find that dent when I start to drift into \"maybe I should research indigenous mushroom ceremonies\" or \"what if I read one more article about set and setting.\" Back to the canister. Back to Rosa's tired voice. Back to Mateo's sideways smile when the faucet stopped dripping.\n\nTom\u00e1s called tonight\u2014\"You ready, ese?\" I told him about the intentions, about the canister. He got quiet for a second and said \"That's it, man. The medicine's gonna show you who you are when you're not running. Just remember\u2014you already know how to finish things. You've been doing it wrong for twenty years, but you've been practicing surviving. Now you get to practice completing.\"\n\nThree weeks. The canister's getting smooth where I keep rubbing it. Rosa's already asleep, but before she turned over, she touched my arm and said \"I believe in you, Didi. Even when you don't.\"\n\nI think maybe that's what I'll hold when things get weird. Not just the metal, but that touch. That belief I haven't earned yet but desperately want to deserve.",
  "system9": "That touch on your arm - \"I believe in you, Didi. Even when you don't\" - that's what you hold when the medicine shows you who you are when you're not running.\n\nYour fingers know what you don't yet. They find that dent when you start drifting into research spirals, bringing you back to Rosa's tired voice and Mateo's sideways smile.\n\nTom\u00e1s is right - you've been practicing surviving for twenty years. Now you get to practice completing. The canister's getting smooth where you keep rubbing it, carrying all those touches and beliefs you haven't earned yet but desperately want to deserve.\n\nThree weeks. You know how to finish this.",
  "user9": "Three weeks, and I'm already different.\n\nCaught myself this morning\u2014Mateo's lunchbox zipper was stuck, and instead of my usual \"I'll fix it later\" (which means Rosa will), I sat there and worked it free. Took fifteen minutes, my coffee got cold, but when it finally zipped smooth? That same feeling as the faucet. Like the canister was humming in my pocket even though I'd left it on the nightstand.\n\nRosa noticed. She didn't say anything, just did this thing where she touches the back of my neck when she walks past. Like she's checking I'm still here, not disappeared into some story about what I should be doing instead of what I'm actually doing.\n\nThe weird part? I'm not even trying to be different. It's just... happening. Like my hands learned something my brain hasn't caught up to yet. Yesterday I finished editing a corporate video in one sitting\u2014boring-ass hospital training thing\u2014and when I exported it, I didn't even hate it. Just clicked \"send to client\" and moved on.\n\nThree weeks, and I already know how to finish this. Not because I figured it out, but because I've been carrying the answer in my pocket this whole time, rubbing it smooth with every doubt, every almost, every \"I'll get to it later.\"\n\nThe medicine's just going to show me what the canister already knows.",
  "system10": "That lunchbox zipper - fifteen minutes and cold coffee, but you sat there until it worked smooth. The canister was humming in your pocket even on the nightstand.\n\nRosa's hand on the back of your neck, checking you're still here instead of disappeared into some story about what you should be doing. She feels it already.\n\nYou're finishing things without trying now. Corporate video in one sitting, clicked send without hating it. Your hands learned something your brain hasn't caught up to yet.\n\nThe medicine won't teach you how to finish - it already lives in that smooth-worn metal, in Rosa's touch, in Mateo's lunchbox zipper. It's just going to show you what the canister already knows.\n\nYou already know how to complete this.",
  "user10": "*\u00d3rale...* I'm sitting here thinking about that\u2014that I've been looking for some big revelation, some lightning bolt from the medicine that's gonna fix twenty years of starting and stopping. But what if it's simpler? What if it's just... this?\n\nWhat if the ceremony's not gonna teach me some secret I don't already know? Like when I was filming Don Eliseo talking about the acequias\u2014he said the water doesn't need to learn how to flow, it just needs the ditch cleared of debris. Maybe that's what this is. Not learning to finish, but clearing out whatever's been blocking the finishing.\n\nRosa came in while I was packing\u2014three days, two pairs of pants, this old Saint Christopher medal my abuela gave me for safe travels, and the canister. She held the medal for a second, didn't say anything, just pressed it into my palm with this look like... like she's already seen me come back. Like the coming back is already done, and we're just waiting for time to catch up.\n\nMateo asked if I'm scared. I told him yeah, but it's the good kind of scared\u2014like before you jump into the Rio Grande in April, when the water's still got winter in it. You know it's gonna be cold as hell, but you also know you're gonna surface laughing.\n\nThe canister's in my bag now. Not going anywhere.",

I've done this drive a hundred times for shoots, but this time I'm not chasing footage or stories. Just carrying this thing in my chest that feels like... like when you finally find the right edit point. That moment where the cut lands and everything clicks.\n\nRosa made me eggs this morning\u2014huevos rancheros with the green chile she saves for special occasions. Didn't say \"have a good trip\" or \"be careful.\" Just \"bring it back, mijo. Bring yourself back.\" And I got it then\u2014she's not waiting for me to become someone else. She's waiting for me to come home as the guy who already knows how to stay.\n\nThe canister's in my jacket pocket. Not the bag\u2014the jacket. Close to my heart where I can feel it when I breathe. When things get weird out there in the desert, when the medicine starts showing me whatever it needs to show me, I'll touch that dent and remember: I've already surfaced laughing from colder water than this.\n\nTomorrow I drive north.

Just watches me like she's memorizing this version before I come back different.\n\nMateo's still asleep but I left him a note on the kitchen counter: \"Kick some goals today, ese. Dad's proud of you.\" Simple. No promises about when I'll be back or what I'll be when I return.

I'm thinking about Mateo's note, how I wrote it in one take\u2014no crossing out, no rewriting, just the words that needed saying.\n\nTwenty years of filmmaking and I finally understand what the great documentarians always knew: the real story isn't what you're running toward, it's what you're carrying back.

Mateo's note written in one take, no crossing out.\n\nTwenty years of filmmaking and you finally get it: the real story's what you're carrying back, not what you're running toward.

The center's this low adobe building that looks like it's been here since before roads, like it just grew out of the earth. They gave me a room with a window facing the Sandias, and I set the canister on the sill where the sunset can find it.\n\nFunny thing\u2014I've been carrying this thing for weeks, rubbing that dent like it holds some secret formula. But sitting here in this quiet room, I realize the only thing inside is what I already know how to be. Like the canister's just been teaching my fingers what my heart already understood.\n\nThey'll come get us soon. We'll sit in circle, say whatever needs saying, drink whatever needs drinking. But I'm not waiting for revelation anymore. I'm just here to finish what I started when I first touched that dented metal and felt something shift.\n\nTomorrow I'll wake up here, then drive south through Espa\u00f1ola with windows down. Rosa will be making coffee in that same doorway, hair still messy, hand still under her cheek like she's holding tomorrow. Mateo will find another note on the counter\u2014this one about how his dad came home and learned how to stay.\n\nThe canister's on the windowsill now, catching the last light. It's empty and full at the same time. Ready to come home.",

They gave us tea that tasted like earth and asked what we were carrying. I told them about the canister, about Rosa's hand on the back of my neck, about twenty years of beautiful failures. Then I shut up and listened to whatever the medicine needed to say.\n\nWhat it said wasn't new. It just showed me what the canister already knew\u2014that finishing isn't something you learn, it's something you remember.

The answers arrived when I stopped asking questions and started making breakfast.\n\nRosa's garden is starting to bloom\u2014tomatillos fattening on the vine, cilantro going to seed.

Where we'll sit next week and the week after.\n\nThe referee blows the final whistle and the afternoon settles into ordinary magic\u2014kids laughing, parents packing up chairs, someone asking if anyone wants to grab burritos after.

Rosa will head to her shift at Presbyterian. Mateo has homework he's been avoiding about New Mexico history. Sofia wants to make cookies after school. The acequia will keep flowing behind our house, carrying whatever needs carrying.\n\nBut tonight, driving through Albuquerque with the windows cracked, I can feel it\u2014that click you get when the edit finally locks into place. Not because everything's fixed or finished or perfect. Just because this is the cut that works. This is the version where I stay."
