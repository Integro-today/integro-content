## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_3:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: I need to know more about your specific journey to guide you properly. What medicine are you working with, and where are you in your process?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Flying to Costa Rica in three weeks for ayahuasca. Amanda thinks this'll fix everything. I dont know man. Never done any of this stuff before.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Three weeks to Costa Rica for ayahuasca. Amanda's hoping this fixes everything, and you're walking in not knowing what to expect.

Heroic Hearts works with veterans, so I'm guessing there's some heavy stuff you're carrying. What are you hoping this medicine might help you with?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Just want the nightmares to stop. Wake up screaming, she's exhausted. Kids look at me like... idk. Like Im a stranger. 

If this plant stuff can stop that, maybe I can be normal again.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Nightmares every night, waking up screaming. Kids looking at you like you're someone they don't recognize. That wears on everyone.

When you imagine the nightmares stopping - what changes beyond just sleeping through the night? What would Amanda notice first?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Maybe I dont jump when the car backfires. Maybe I can sit through dinner without snapping at Michael for talking too loud. Maybe Amanda stops sleeping in the guest room.

I dont know. Just want her to look at me like she used to.


**intentions_workflow_3**: No more jumping at backfires, no more snapping at Michael for being loud, Amanda sleeping next to you again. You want her to look at you like she used to.

What's underneath the jumping and snapping? What's your body still protecting you from?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Look. I dont want to go there. Just tell me what I need to do before this ceremony thing.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Got it. You want practical steps, not deep dives.

Three main threads:
1. Stop the nightmares so Amanda can sleep with you again
2. End the hypervigilance - no more jumping at sounds or snapping at the kids
3. Get Amanda to look at you like she used to

Let's turn these into intentions you can carry into ceremony.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. That sounds right. 

How do I make intentions out of that? I dont want to mess this up.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I welcome peaceful sleep so Amanda and I can rest together again
2. I release the hypervigilance, teaching my body it's safe at home
3. I open to being present with my family without scanning for threats

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Can we make it simpler? This feels... I dont know. Too fancy.

Like "I want to sleep through the night" and "I want to stop jumping at everything" and "I want to be a better husband."

Thats it.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Got it. Simple and direct:

1. I want to sleep through the night
2. I want to stop jumping at everything
3. I want to be a better husband

âœ“ Intention 1 locked in: I want to sleep through the night

These are your words, not mine. How do the other two land?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Yeah. Those three.

Guess Im ready then.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. You've got three solid intentions.

How do you want to keep them close? Some options:
- Write them on a card in your wallet
- Keep them on your phone lock screen
- Read them each morning before the ceremony

What would help you hold these when things get hard?


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: Phone lock screen I guess. Always got that on me.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I want to sleep through the night
- I want to stop jumping at everything  
- I want to be a better husband

Your ritual: phone lock screen. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes. You're set.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: yeah. okay. 

idk if thisll work but at least i know what im aiming for.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's the point. You know what you're aiming for. That's enough for now.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: yeah. thats all i got.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Then you're ready.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: yeah. guess i am.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Good. Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: yeah. three weeks.


**intentions_workflow_3**: See you on the other side.


**jamie_adhd_persona_1**: yeah. see you.
