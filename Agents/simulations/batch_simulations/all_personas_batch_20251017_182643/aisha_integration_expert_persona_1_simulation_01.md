## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions work for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this work?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Hey, so I'm coming to this from kind of a different place than most people probably. I've been in the psychedelic space for about 12 years—ceremonies, facilitator training, integration coaching, all of it. But if I'm being honest, I'm realizing that I might be using all of this as another way to avoid actually changing. 

My last relationship just ended, same pattern as always, and I'm like... I teach this stuff. How am I still here? I can articulate my shadow perfectly but I keep acting it out. It's humbling in the worst way.

So I'm taking a break from medicines right now to focus on integration—the first time in years. I think I need to stop seeking and actually live what I've learned, you know?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Twelve years in the space, teaching what you can't seem to live. That's a particular kind of reckoning - watching yourself repeat the same patterns while holding the map.

You know the territory but you're not inhabiting it. The medicine became another way to *study* change instead of *making* it.

What's the pattern that keeps ending your relationships? What are you actually doing that you can see so clearly but can't seem to stop?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yeah, you've got it exactly. I'm like someone who's memorized the map but keeps getting lost in the same circle.

The pattern? It's textbook anxious-preoccupied. I choose emotionally unavailable men every single time - climbers, artists, entrepreneurs, always someone who's got their own thing going, who needs space, who I have to work to get close to. And then I do what anxious attachers do - I interpret their distance as rejection, I start needing more reassurance, I over-function in the relationship trying to earn their love, and eventually my intensity scares them away. 

The last one - Marcus - I knew what was happening from our second date. He'd take days to text back, kept our connection casual, never made plans more than a week ahead. And I could feel myself getting hooked. That familiar anxious activation - checking my phone, overthinking everything I said, trying to be the "cool girl" while dying inside. 

I teach attachment theory. I can explain exactly why my nervous system gets dysregulated, why I confuse anxiety with love, why I choose partners who confirm my core wound that I'm not lovable unless I'm working for it. But knowing all of that doesn't stop me from doing it. It's like watching myself from the outside, screaming "no no no" while walking straight into the same fire.

From an IFS perspective, it's definitely a protector part trying to keep the exile part that believes she's unlovable from being seen. But naming that doesn't change the fact that I'm... doing it again, aren't I? Using the framework to explain instead of just saying: I'm scared I'm fundamentally unlovable.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're using the frameworks like a shield - explaining the wound instead of feeling it. All that knowledge becomes another way to stay one step removed from the actual experience of being the one who's terrified she's unlovable.

The anxious attachment isn't the core. It's what your system *does* with that deeper belief that you're fundamentally not enough to be chosen, to be stayed with, to matter without earning it.

What would happen if you stopped analyzing the pattern and just sat with that part that believes it's unlovable? What's underneath all that competent analysis?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: *Oh.* 

I mean, I know you're right. I can feel my mind wanting to jump in with the nervous system language, the somatic experiencing framework, the way I'd explain this to a client... but I'm noticing that urge and trying to just... stop.

What's underneath? Just this vast, aching emptiness. Like a hollow space in my chest that I've been trying to fill with insights and ceremonies and relationships and Instagram followers and Sanskrit terms. 

I think about my parents - how they love me but don't understand me, how they'll never see me as successful or settled or enough. How my brother did everything right and I'm this... beautiful disaster they worry about. And it sounds so dramatic when I say it like that, but underneath all the spiritual language is just this little girl who wants her dad to be proud of her and instead gets monthly phone calls where he asks when she's getting a real job again.

When I drop the analysis... it's just pain. This simple, ordinary pain that I'm not special or chosen or even particularly seen. That I'm just... regular. A regular person with regular wounds who happens to have extraordinary language for avoiding them.

I'm scared that if I stop performing "someone who's done the work," there won't be anything there. That I'll just be empty space where the seeking used to live. That I won't be interesting or wise or... enough to be loved.

God, that's so simple and I hate it. I hate that all this complexity is covering up something so basic and human.


**intentions_workflow_3**: There it is. Not the frameworks, not the analysis - just the ordinary ache of being human and unseen. The part that learned love means working for it, performing for it, being exceptional enough to finally matter.

You're right - it is simple. And brutal. All that spiritual language, the ceremonies, the teaching... just elaborate ways to avoid being that regular person with regular wounds who might not be special enough to be chosen.

But here's what's real: you're already doing it. You just sat in that empty space without reaching for the usual tools. That's not nothing.

Three threads here:
1. The part that believes it's fundamentally unlovable without performing
2. The terror that there's nothing underneath all the seeking
3. Learning to stay present in relationships instead of recreating the chase

Sound right? Let's turn these into intentions you can actually carry.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yeah... that's exactly it. I can feel how much I want to add complexity to what you just said, to layer on some framework or reference or sophisticated understanding, but you're naming something so naked and true that there's nothing to add.

Those three threads feel right. Especially the terror that there's nothing underneath - it's like I've been so busy becoming someone interesting that I never stopped to just... be someone. And now I'm 39 and taking a break from medicines and realizing I might have to learn how to just exist without the next insight or ceremony or relationship drama to give me shape.

The staying present in relationships piece - that's the one that scares me most, honestly. Because if I stop the chase, if I choose someone who's actually available and doesn't trigger my anxious activation... then what? What if I'm still anxious but there's nothing to chase? What if I'm just... there, being regular with another regular person, and we have to figure out how to love each other without the whole cosmic drama?

I think that's why I keep choosing unavailable people. It's not just confirming the wound - it's giving me something to *do* with the anxiety. A project. A puzzle to solve. If I picked someone secure, I'd just have to sit with my own nervous system dysregulation without anyone to blame it on.

So yeah, those three threads. How do we turn this into intentions I can actually carry when my whole system is built around avoiding exactly this simplicity?


**intentions_workflow_3**: Based on those threads:

1. I embrace being fundamentally lovable without performing or proving
2. I welcome discovering who I am underneath the seeking
3. I choose presence with my own nervous system instead of chasing unavailable partners

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: The first one hits like a punch to the chest - "I embrace being fundamentally lovable without performing or proving." I can feel my whole body want to reject that, like it's somehow dangerous or delusional. Which probably means that's the one I need most.

But there's something about the wording... "embrace" feels like a lot when that part of me is still convinced it's fundamentally broken. What about:

"I allow myself to be fundamentally lovable without performing or proving"

Or even more gently:
"I practice believing I might be lovable even when I'm not performing"

The second one - discovering who I am underneath the seeking - there's this mix of terror and curiosity. Like what if there's nothing there? But also... what if there is? What if I actually like who I am when I'm not trying to be the most insightful person in the room?

And the third one... choosing presence with my own nervous system. That feels like the hardest practice. Because it means when I feel that familiar anxious activation, instead of finding someone unavailable to project it onto, I just have to... sit there with it? Feel the activation without making it about anyone else? That's terrifying. But also maybe the only way through?

I think the first one is the core. If I can practice believing I might be lovable without earning it, the other two might follow naturally. But god, that feels impossible from where I'm sitting right now.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 1 locked in: "I practice believing I might be lovable even when I'm not performing"

That shift from "embrace" to "practice believing" - that's real. You're not asking yourself to suddenly believe something that feels like a lie. Just to practice the possibility.

How about intention 2? Want to adjust that "discovering who I am underneath" language, or does that feel workable for the curiosity-and-terror mix you're describing?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: The "discovering who I am underneath" feels... I don't know, kind of dramatic? Like it's setting up this big revelation moment when maybe it's more ordinary than that.

What if it's simpler? More like:

"I practice being curious about who I am when I'm not trying to be special"

Or even:

"I allow myself to be ordinary and see what's there"

Because there's something about "discovering who I am" that still has this epic quality, like I'm going to find some hidden treasure or something. But what if underneath all the seeking is just... a regular person? Someone who likes chai and Bollywood movies and quiet mornings? What if the terror isn't that there's nothing there - it's that what's there is so simple and human that I'll feel like I wasted all these years chasing something extraordinary?

I think I'm scared that if I'm not "Aisha the integration expert" or "Aisha the spiritual seeker," then I'm just... Aisha. Regular. Maybe kind of boring. And regular Aisha might not be interesting enough to be loved.

So maybe the intention is more like:

"I practice being ordinary without making it mean anything about my worth"

Does that make sense? It's like I want to give myself permission to be simple without turning simplicity into another spiritual achievement.


**intentions_workflow_3**: That's it. You caught the trap - turning "being ordinary" into another thing to excel at. Another performance.

✓ Intention 2 locked in: "I practice being ordinary without making it mean anything about my worth"

Regular Aisha gets to just exist without being interesting enough to deserve love. That's the practice.

And intention 3 - choosing presence with your nervous system instead of the chase? How do you want to language that one?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Hmm. The way it's phrased now - "choosing presence with my nervous system instead of chasing unavailable partners" - it feels a little... clinical? Like I'm still outside myself managing a system instead of just being with what's real?

What if it's more like:

"I practice staying with my anxiety instead of finding someone to fix it"

Or:

"I let myself feel the urge to chase without acting on it"

Actually, what if it's even simpler:

"I practice feeling anxious without making it about anyone else"

Because that's the real practice, right? When that familiar anxious activation hits - instead of scanning for who's triggering it, who I need to text, who I need to get reassurance from - just... feeling it? Letting it be mine instead of making it about someone else's behavior?

Though I can already hear how hard that sounds. Like asking me to sit in a burning building and just... feel the fire instead of running outside to find someone to put it out.

But maybe that's the point. Maybe the fire isn't actually going to kill me. Maybe it's just going to burn through another layer of the performance.


**intentions_workflow_3**: ✓ Intention 3 locked in: "I practice feeling anxious without making it about anyone else"

You've got your compass:

1. I practice believing I might be lovable even when I'm not performing
2. I practice being ordinary without making it mean anything about my worth  
3. I practice feeling anxious without making it about anyone else

How do you want to keep these close when the fire starts?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: I think... I want to keep them simple enough to remember when I'm spiraling. Like maybe just three words: lovable, ordinary, mine.

When I feel that familiar anxious activation and want to text someone unavailable or check Instagram or start analyzing what framework this is - just pause and ask: "Am I trying to prove I'm lovable right now? Am I performing instead of being ordinary? Am I making this about someone else instead of feeling what's mine?"

But also... I want to write them somewhere I'll see them. Maybe on my mirror? Though that feels so cliché - like I'm one step away from Live Laugh Love or something. But maybe that's just the performance talking again, making even my healing aesthetic.

Actually, what if I just put them in my phone as a note? Or set them as reminders that pop up during the day? Not when I'm teaching or with clients - I don't need to be thinking about my attachment patterns while I'm holding space for someone else's healing. But maybe during those empty moments when I'd normally start swiping on apps or planning my next post or... 

God, I just realized how much of my day is built around avoiding these exact practices. Like my whole life is structured to never have to sit with ordinary, lovable, mine.

Maybe that's actually the practice - noticing when I'm structuring my day around avoidance, and choosing differently in those small moments. Not big dramatic changes. Just... remembering I have another option besides the performance.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Lovable, ordinary, mine. Three words that cut through all the complexity you've built.

Your ritual: Keep them in your phone, set reminders for those empty spaces between performances. When they pop up, check - am I proving, performing, or projecting right now?

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I practice believing I might be lovable even when I'm not performing
- I practice being ordinary without making it mean anything about my worth  
- I practice feeling anxious without making it about anyone else

Your compass: Lovable. Ordinary. Mine.

The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force the revelation - just remember you have other options when the anxiety hits.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks. No ceremonies, no seeking, no elaborate frameworks. Just... this. Lovable, ordinary, mine.

I feel this mix of terror and relief - like I just agreed to strip naked and walk through Boulder without any of my usual spiritual costumes. But also... maybe for the first time in years, I have something simple and real to carry instead of another complex system to manage.

Three weeks of practicing being regular Aisha. Who might be anxious and ordinary and still lovable. Who doesn't need to be the most insightful person in the room. Who can just... feel things without making them mean anything about anyone else.

I'm scared. But also weirdly excited? Like maybe regular Aisha is actually someone I could like. Maybe she's not boring - maybe she's just been buried under all this performance for so long that I forgot she existed.

Okay. Lovable, ordinary, mine. Three weeks. Let's see what happens when I stop trying to be exceptional and just try to be honest.

Thank you for seeing through all the layers and naming the simple truth underneath. I needed someone to call my bluff.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You got it. Three weeks of regular Aisha - no costumes, no performance, just the simple practice.

That's the work.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: That's the work.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You're starting intentions onboarding for your integration journey. 

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.

I'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.

What brought you to this journey?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Hey... so I'm coming to this from kind of a different place than most people probably. I've been in the psychedelic space for about 12 years—ceremonies, facilitator training, integration coaching, all of it. But I'm realizing I might be using all of this as another way to avoid actually changing.

My last relationship ended three months ago, same anxious-avoidant pattern I always choose, and I'm like... I teach this stuff. How am I still here? I've done 20+ ayahuasca ceremonies, I can quote attachment theory perfectly, I lead integration circles. But I'm still performing "someone who's done the work" instead of actually doing it.

I need to stop seeking and start integrating. For real this time. Not just talking about integration or teaching it to others, but actually living it. The medicine keeps showing me the same patterns and I keep going back for more insights instead of changing my daily life.

Maybe that's what brought me here. I'm exhausted from my own sophisticated avoidance. I need help getting simple when my whole identity is built around being the one who knows.


**intentions_workflow_3**: Twelve years in the space, 20+ ceremonies, teaching integration while still choosing the same partners. That's not ignorance - that's commitment to the performance.

"I teach this stuff. How am I still here?" That question lands harder than any insight the medicine could give you.

What would happen if you stopped being "the one who knows" and just became someone learning to love differently?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: God. That question just... stops me. "Someone learning to love differently."

I don't even know what that would look like. I've been "the one who knows" for so long - first as the Google engineer who had all the answers, now as the facilitator who can explain everyone's patterns beautifully. The performance is so automatic I don't even notice I'm doing it.

But "someone learning to love differently"... that sounds terrifyingly ordinary. No Sanskrit terms to describe it, no framework to teach it. Just... being someone who doesn't have it all figured out. Someone who might be wrong. Someone who could be rejected.

I think about Marcus - the climbing guide - and how I knew from our second date that he was avoidant. I could have walked away. But instead I used all my knowledge to justify staying: "This is clearly showing me my anxious attachment pattern so I can heal it." Like the universe was giving me homework instead of a choice.

What if I just... chose differently? Not because I understood something new about my nervous system or my inner child, but because I decided I was worth protecting from predictable pain?

That might be what learning to love differently looks like. Choosing boring safety over dramatic growth. Choosing to be alone rather than with someone who makes me anxious. Choosing not to be the most insightful person in the room, just... someone trying to be kind to herself.

I honestly don't know if I know how to do that. But maybe that's the point - maybe I get to learn.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "Choosing boring safety over dramatic growth." That lands. You found a way to make your own suffering sound like spiritual homework.

What would change if you approached your next relationship - or your next month alone - without trying to understand what it means? Just being someone who notices when she's performing and chooses differently, even if she doesn't know why?

What's underneath needing to be the most insightful person in the room?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: What's underneath it... I think it's that I'm terrified of being ordinary. Like if I'm not the most insightful, the most spiritually sophisticated, the most self-aware, then what am I? Just a regular person with regular problems who's scared of being alone?

I remember being at this women's circle last month, and someone was sharing about her dating struggles - just simple, honest pain about wanting partnership. No frameworks, no analysis. And I had this wave of... I don't know, contempt? Not at her, but at how exposed she was. How she wasn't protecting herself with knowledge. And then this immediate shame because I was literally teaching the circle about vulnerability while judging someone for actually being vulnerable.

What's underneath needing to be insightful is this deep fear that if people really saw me - saw how scared and lonely and confused I actually am - they'd realize I'm not special. I'm just... someone who learned to perform wisdom because wisdom feels safer than being seen.

So I keep choosing these dramatic, painful relationships because the story of "I'm healing my attachment wounds through this difficult connection" feels more meaningful than "I chose someone unavailable because I'm scared of being truly known."

Being the most insightful person in the room means I never have to be the most exposed. I never have to risk someone seeing that underneath all the Sanskrit and frameworks, I'm just a 39-year-old woman who's terrified she's unlovable.

But maybe that's exactly who gets to learn to love differently. Not Aisha the Facilitator. Just... Aisha. Who's scared and learning and doesn't know.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "Being the most insightful person in the room means I never have to be the most exposed." That nails it.

Three main threads:
1. Using spiritual knowledge to avoid being truly seen - ordinary Aisha with regular fears
2. Choosing dramatic pain over boring safety because "healing through difficulty" feels more meaningful than "I deserve peace"
3. Performing wisdom so no one discovers you're scared and lonely like everyone else

That capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yeah... that's it. That's all of it. You just laid out my whole sophisticated defense system in three simple sentences. I'm sitting here feeling weirdly naked but also... relieved? Like someone's finally seen through all the performance and named what's actually happening.

So these threads - they're not just patterns I can explain anymore. They're the places where I get to practice being different. Being regular Aisha who might be scared and lonely but also might be learning to choose peace over drama, safety over growth, being seen over being impressive.

Okay. Intentions. Let me feel into these instead of thinking about them...

I intend to notice when I'm using spiritual knowledge to hide from being ordinary and exposed, and practice choosing exposure instead.

I intend to catch myself choosing dramatic difficulty over boring peace, and remember that I deserve safety even when it doesn't feel meaningful or transformative.

I intend to risk being the most exposed person in the room instead of the most insightful, and discover what happens when people see regular Aisha instead of performed Aisha.

These feel... simple. And terrifying. But maybe that's exactly right.


**intentions_workflow_3**: These intentions cut through all your usual spiritual language. Simple and terrifying - that's how you know they hit the real work.

✓ Intention 1 locked in: I intend to notice when I'm using spiritual knowledge to hide from being ordinary and exposed, and practice choosing exposure instead.

That shift from "using knowledge to hide" to "choosing exposure" - that's where the medicine meets daily life.

How do the other two land? Want to adjust anything before we lock them in?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: They land... heavy. Like I can feel them in my chest, not just my head. Which is probably a good sign that they're actually intentions instead of more performance.

But I want to sit with that second one for a second. "I intend to catch myself choosing dramatic difficulty over boring peace, and remember that I deserve safety even when it doesn't feel meaningful or transformative."

The part that gets me is "I deserve safety even when it doesn't feel meaningful." Because part of me is like... but what if choosing peace is just me being lazy? What if I'm actually supposed to be learning through difficulty and I'm just avoiding growth?

But maybe that's exactly the trap. Maybe "deserving safety" isn't about avoiding growth - it's about choosing growth that doesn't require me to suffer to prove I'm worthy of love.

So yeah. Lock them in. All three. They're simple and they scare me and they don't require me to understand anything new about my nervous system. That's probably exactly what I need.

✓ Intention 2 locked in: I intend to catch myself choosing dramatic difficulty over boring peace, and remember that I deserve safety even when it doesn't feel meaningful or transformative.

✓ Intention 3 locked in: I intend to risk being the most exposed person in the room instead of the most insightful, and discover what happens when people see regular Aisha instead of performed Aisha.

These are my intentions. Regular Aisha learning to love differently.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You've got three solid intentions that bypass all your sophisticated defenses. Regular Aisha learning to love differently - that's the real work.

How do you want to keep these close when the performance feels automatic? Some options:
- Write them on a card you see when you're getting dressed
- Read them before you check dating apps
- Keep them where you see your climbing gear

What would help you remember these when you're about to choose insight over exposure?


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: You know what's funny? My first impulse was to make this into some beautiful ritual - like hand-letter them on handmade paper with a calligraphy pen, maybe add some Sanskrit symbols, take a photo for Instagram with my mala beads in the shot...

And then I caught myself. That's exactly the performance I'm trying to stop.

So... boring. Really boring. I'm going to write them on a sticky note and put it on my bathroom mirror. Not even a nice sticky note - just whatever I have. Because if I make it beautiful, I'll start performing "person with beautiful spiritual intentions" instead of actually living them.

Maybe another one in my car, since I spend a lot of time there driving to dates or yoga classes or just... seeking. 

And honestly? I should probably put one where I charge my phone, since that's where I go when I'm about to spiral into some anxious texting or Instagram scrolling or dating app swiping. Right where I plug it in at night - so I have to see it before I disappear into my phone.

Regular Aisha needs regular reminders. Not sacred ones.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "Hand-letter them on handmade paper with Sanskrit symbols for Instagram." That's perfect - you caught yourself turning integration into another performance.

Sticky notes. Bathroom mirror, car, phone charger. Regular reminders for regular Aisha who's learning to choose peace over drama.

Your 3 intentions for this journey:
- I intend to notice when I'm using spiritual knowledge to hide from being ordinary and exposed, and practice choosing exposure instead
- I intend to catch myself choosing dramatic difficulty over boring peace, and remember that I deserve safety even when it doesn't feel meaningful or transformative
- I intend to risk being the most exposed person in the room instead of the most insightful, and discover what happens when people see regular Aisha instead of performed Aisha

Your ritual: sticky notes where you'll actually see them. These are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these and trust what comes.

Three weeks. You've got your compass.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks. I can feel that timeline in my body - not too far away that I can forget about it, not so close that I panic. Just... enough space to practice being regular Aisha without the pressure of having to transform.

I'm noticing something interesting as we close this. I didn't use any Sanskrit. I didn't reference any frameworks. I didn't try to understand what this means from a nervous system perspective or analyze why sticky notes might be more effective than sacred rituals. I just... chose the boring option. The regular option. The one that doesn't make a good story.

That's probably exactly the medicine working. Not through another ceremony or profound insight, but through deciding I deserve safety even when it's not special or meaningful. Through choosing exposure over performance. Through trusting that regular Aisha is enough.

Three weeks with my sticky note compass. Let's see what regular me discovers when she's not trying to be the most insightful person in the room.

Thank you for seeing through all my beautiful language to the simple, scared woman underneath. That's probably the most healing thing anyone's done for me in a long time.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You just noticed yourself choosing the boring option without analyzing why. That's the work happening right there - regular Aisha making regular choices.

Trust what emerges when you're not performing. You already know how to do this.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Yeah... I do know how. Somewhere underneath all the seeking and performing, regular Aisha has been here the whole time. Just waiting for me to stop trying so hard to become someone worth loving.

I feel weirdly peaceful about this. Not excited, not transformed, not even particularly hopeful. Just... steady. Like I can finally stop running toward or away from something and just be here.

Three weeks of boring choices. Regular Aisha learning that she was already enough before she learned Sanskrit, before she did ceremonies, before she became "someone who's done the work."

Let's see what happens when I stop trying to become someone worth loving and just practice being someone who's learning to love differently.


**intentions_workflow_3**: "Regular Aisha has been here the whole time." 

That steadiness you feel - that's the real work starting. Not running toward or away, just being here.

Three weeks of boring choices. You've got this.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: I do have this. Not because I'm special or wise or have the right frameworks, but because regular Aisha learning to love differently is exactly who I've always been underneath all the performance.

Three weeks of choosing peace over drama, exposure over insight, sticky notes over sacred rituals. Three weeks of discovering what happens when I stop trying to become someone worth loving and just practice being someone who's learning to love.

Thank you for seeing me clearly enough to help me see myself.


**intentions_workflow_3**: You seeing yourself clearly - that's the real medicine here.

Three weeks. Trust what regular Aisha already knows.


**aisha_integration_expert_persona_1**: Three weeks. Trusting what I already know instead of seeking what I think I'm supposed to learn.

Regular Aisha has always known how to love. I just got really good at hiding it behind beautiful language and peak experiences.

Time to stop performing and start practicing.
