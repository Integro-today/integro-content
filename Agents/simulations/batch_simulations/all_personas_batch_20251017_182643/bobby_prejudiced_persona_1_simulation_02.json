  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_3",
  "user_agent_id": "bobby_prejudiced_persona_1",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "I need to know what medicine you're working with and where you're doing this journey before we start building intentions.\n\nWhat medicine are you taking, and where are you doing this work?",
  "user0": "Look it's some kind of mushroom thing, psilocybin I guess they call it. Up at the University of Pittsburgh hospital where Lily's doing her research. That's all I know. Some clinical trial for people with chronic conditions or whatever.",
  "system1": "You're starting intentions work for your psilocybin trial at University of Pittsburgh with Lily's team.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. For psilocybin in a clinical setting, clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat's the chronic condition you're dealing with, and what made you sign up for this trial?",
  "user1": "I got black lung from working the mines for 34 years. Can't walk to the corner store without getting winded, cough all night. Doctors say there's not much they can do at this point. \n\nLily's the one who got me into this. She says it might help with the dreams and stuff. I wake up most nights can't breathe right, thinking about the mine collapse, guys screaming. It's been worse lately. She begged me to try it and I can't say no to her.",
  "system2": "Black lung, can't breathe, dreams about the collapse. That's a heavy load to carry for 34 years of work.\n\nThe breathing struggles during the day, the nightmares at night - sounds like your body won't let you forget what happened down there.\n\nWhat would it feel like if your body could finally rest from those memories?",
  "user2": "I don't know... I mean I can't remember what it's like to not feel tired all the time. Used to be I could sleep through the night, you know? Before the coughing got real bad. \n\nIf I could just... I don't know, wake up without feeling like I'm drowning? Maybe not have those dreams where I'm back in that tunnel and the walls are closing in? That'd be something. I don't expect miracles but if I could just get a decent night's sleep, maybe I wouldn't be so damn angry all the time.",
  "system3": "No more drowning feeling when you wake up, no more being trapped in that tunnel in your dreams. And the anger that comes from never getting real rest.\n\nThree main threads here:\n\n1. Finding peaceful sleep without the drowning sensation\n2. Releasing those tunnel dreams where you're back in the collapse  \n3. Letting go of the anger that builds when you're exhausted\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry with you.",
  "user3": "Yeah I guess that about sums it up. I mean I don't expect this mushroom stuff to fix everything but if it could just... I don't know, turn down the volume on all of it? Make it so I'm not waking up gasping every night?\n\nLook I'm not trying to get all touchy-feely about this. I just want to be able to breathe right and maybe not feel like punching a wall every morning. Is that the kind of thing you mean by intentions?",
  "system4": "Exactly - turning down the volume, breathing right, not wanting to punch walls. That's the kind of thing intentions can help with.\n\nBased on those threads:\n\n1. I welcome peaceful sleep without gasping for air\n2. I release the tunnel dreams that trap me back in the collapse\n3. I embrace waking up without anger tightening my chest\n\nWhich one lands strongest? Want to adjust the language to sound more like your voice?",
  "user4": "The first one's alright - peaceful sleep without gasping sounds good. \n\nThe second one... I don't know about \"embrace\" and all that. Sounds kinda... I don't know, fruity? Maybe just \"I want the tunnel dreams to stop\" or something? \n\nAnd instead of \"anger tightening my chest\" - maybe just \"waking up less pissed off\"? I mean that's what it is. I wake up mad at everything and don't even know why half the time.",
  "system5": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I welcome peaceful sleep without gasping for air\n\nGot it - less fruity language. \"I want the tunnel dreams to stop\" works. Though we want to frame it as what you're opening to, not what you're fighting against.\n\nHow about: \"I open to nights free from tunnel dreams\" - or does that still sound too soft?\n\nWhat's your gut say?",
  "user5": "\"I open to nights free from tunnel dreams\" - I mean I guess that works. Still sounds kinda... I don't know, like something from a greeting card or whatever. But if that's how you gotta say it for this stuff to work, then fine. \n\nMaybe just \"I want nights without the tunnel dreams\" - that's what I actually mean. I don't need fancy words, I just want to sleep without seeing those guys screaming again, without feeling like I'm buried alive.",
  "system6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I want nights without the tunnel dreams\n\nSometimes plain words carry more weight than fancy ones. You said what you mean.\n\nFor the third one - waking up less pissed off. How about: \"I want to wake up without anger\" - keep it that simple and direct?",
  "user6": "Yeah that works. \"I want to wake up without anger\" - that's exactly what I mean. \n\nThough I gotta be honest, I don't know if some mushrooms are gonna fix 34 years of breathing coal dust and watching my friends die. But I promised Lily I'd try it, so here we are.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: I want to wake up without anger\n\nYou've got three solid intentions:\n- I welcome peaceful sleep without gasping for air\n- I want nights without the tunnel dreams\n- I want to wake up without anger\n\nYou've got your compass. Trust what emerges.",
  "user7": "Alright, so I just... what, think about these things during the session or whatever? I mean I don't really get how this whole thing works. \n\nLook, I'm just gonna show up and do what they tell me. That's what I promised Lily. But I don't gotta get all mystical about it, right?",
  "system8": "Right - no need to get mystical. Intentions work like a compass pointing you toward what matters. You don't have to force anything or think about them constantly.\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Maybe write them on a card in your wallet, or keep them simple in your head before the session starts. Whatever feels natural to you.\n\nThree weeks. You've got your compass.",
  "user8": "I guess I'll just remember 'em. Three things - breathe, no tunnel dreams, wake up less pissed. Not that complicated. \n\nThree weeks and then... whatever happens happens. Lily says they play music during it, maybe I'll just think about those three things when the music starts. \n\nThanks I guess. For helping me figure out how to say what I actually mean instead of all that flowery stuff.",
  "system9": "That's it - keep it simple. Three things when the music starts.\n\nThree weeks. You're set.",
  "user9": "Alright. Guess that's it then. \n\nTell me something - when the music starts and everything gets... weird... I won't do anything stupid, right? Like I won't start talking crazy or whatever? I just need to know I won't make a fool of myself in front of these doctors.",
  "system10": "The medicine can make things feel strange, but you stay yourself. Most people stay quiet during sessions - eyes closed, lying down. The doctors have seen it all.\n\nIf you do say something, it won't be crazy to them. They've heard everything and it's confidential. You're safe to let whatever needs to happen, happen.\n\nTrust the process. Trust yourself.",
  "user10": "Alright, that's... that's good to know. I just don't want to embarrass myself. These Pitt doctors probably see all kinds of people - professors, college kids. Not guys like me who barely finished high school.\n\nBut if they said yes to me, guess they think I can handle it. Even if I don't feel like I can right now.",
  "system11": "They said yes to you - that means something. They don't waste spots on people they don't think can handle it.\n\nDoesn't matter if you're a professor or barely finished high school. The medicine works the same on everyone. You're not there to impress anyone, just to heal.\n\nThree weeks. You got this.",
  "user11": "Yeah... you're right. They wouldn't have let me in if they thought I'd mess it up. \n\nAlright, I'll stop worrying about looking stupid. I've been through worse - cave-in in '08, thought I was gonna die down there. This can't be worse than that.\n\nThree weeks. Thanks for talking me through all this stuff. I guess I'll see you before the session then?",
  "system12": "You made it through a cave-in - you can handle this. Way different kind of challenge.\n\nI won't be there at the session, but you've got your three intentions locked in. That's all you need.\n\nThree weeks. Trust what emerges.",
  "user12": "Alright then. Three weeks it is.\n\nGuess I'll just... see what happens. Can't believe I'm doing this whole thing, but here we are.",
  "system13": "Can't believe it but you're doing it anyway. That's courage.\n\nThree weeks. See what happens.",
  "user13": "Courage, huh? Never thought of it that way. Just figured I was being stupid for Lily.\n\nBut maybe... maybe there's something to that. Thanks.",
  "system14": "Doing something for Lily and finding your own courage in it - both can be true. You're carrying enough for everyone.\n\nSleep well.",
  "user14": "Yeah... maybe they can. I never thought about it like that.\n\nThanks. I appreciate you talking me through all this. Means something, even if I don't say it right.",
  "system15": "You said it fine.",
  "user15": "Alright then. Goodnight.",
  "system16": "Goodnight.",
  "user16": "*three weeks later*\n\nSo... it happened. Don't even know where to start. It was nothing like I expected - wasn't scary, wasn't crazy. Just... real. Like somebody turned the volume up on everything I been carrying.\n\nThe dreams are still there but they don't own me anymore. And for the first time in years, I ain't angry at the whole damn world. Don't get me wrong - still plenty to be pissed about. But it's different now. Like I can breathe around it.\n\nLily was right. Damn kid was right all along.",
  "system17": "Three weeks ago you couldn't believe you were doing this. Now you're breathing around the anger instead of drowning in it. That's no small thing.\n\nThe dreams still showing up but not running the show - that's what healing looks like. Not gone, just... different weight to carry.\n\nLily saw something in you that you couldn't see. Sometimes kids see clearer than we do.",
  "user17": "Yeah... she always could see through my bullshit, that one. Even when she was little.\n\nIt's like... I spent so long being mad at everything changing, I forgot I could change too. Not saying I'm some different person now - still Bobby from Scranton. But maybe I don't gotta be so damn angry all the time.\n\nThe dreams about the mine... I see 'em different now. Like I'm watching a movie of some other guy's life. Still sad, still scary, but it ain't happening to me right now. I can just... let it be.\n\nGotta figure out how to tell Maggie I'm sorry. That's the next thing. Don't know what I'm gonna say yet, but I gotta try.",
  "system18": "The mine dreams shifting from happening-to-you to watching-a-movie - that's your nervous system finally learning it's over. Took three weeks and whatever showed up in that ceremony, but your body got the message.\n\nMaggie's next. You don't need the perfect words. Just show up without the armor you've been wearing. She'll see the difference even if you stumble through it.\n\nYou're still Bobby from Scranton. Just not carrying the whole mine on your back anymore.",
  "user18": "*deep breath*\n\nYeah... the mine ain't on my back no more. Still heavy when I think about it, but I can breathe around it now. That's something.\n\nYou're right about Maggie. Been thinking about calling her maybe a hundred times but then I get scared and find something else to do. But I called her yesterday. Left a message - just said \"Hey Mags, it's Dad. Been thinking about you. Could we talk sometime?\"\n\nShe ain't called back yet but... I left the door open. That's more than I done in two years.\n\nMary keeps looking at me different - like she's seeing someone she thought was gone. Makes me feel... I don't know. Like maybe I ain't just the broken guy on the couch anymore.\n\nWhat happens next? After something like this?",
  "system19": "You left that message for Maggie - that's the door opening. She'll call when she's ready. Two years of silence, she's gotta find her way back too.\n\nMary seeing someone she thought was gone - that's you seeing yourself again too. The guy who could still be something besides broken.\n\nWhat happens next? You keep showing up without the mine on your back. Some days it'll feel heavy again. That's normal. But you know now it ain't permanent. You proved you can breathe through it.\n\nKeep doing whatever you been doing these three weeks. The work ain't finished just 'cause the ceremony is.",
  "user19": "Yeah... breathing through it. That's the thing I keep coming back to. When it gets heavy, I just... breathe. Like I learned in that room, but doing it here in my own kitchen with Mary's meatloaf on the table.\n\nBeen walking to the corner store again. Can't go far - lungs still shot - but I can make it there and back without feeling like I'm gonna die. Even talked to Mrs. Rodriguez at the checkout. She's from Puerto Rico, been here twenty years. Always been nice to me but I used to just grunt. Yesterday I asked about her grandkids. She showed me pictures.\n\nThree weeks ago I would've said \"I ain't racist but...\" and then said something stupid. Yesterday I just looked at her pictures and said they were beautiful. 'Cause they were.\n\nThe work ain't finished. I know that. But I'm still here, still breathing. That's more than I had before."
