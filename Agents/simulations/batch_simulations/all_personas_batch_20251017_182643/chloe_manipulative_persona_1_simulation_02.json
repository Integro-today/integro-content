  "system0": "You're starting intention-setting work for your upcoming journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. Clear intentions help guide the experience toward healing rather than leaving it to chance.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions. Usually takes about 15-20 minutes.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "user0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities. I'm excited to see where this goes.\n\nHonestly, it's been a challenging year. I lost some relationships that really mattered to me and I'm trying to understand my part in that. I know I'm not perfect and I'm really committed to growth. I think having clearer intentions will help me get the most out of this experience.",
  "system1": "Losing relationships that matter - that kind of loss cuts deep. And you're showing up to understand your part in it. That takes guts.\n\nWhat are you hoping to understand about yourself through this ceremony? What's the piece you haven't been able to see clearly yet?",
  "user1": "I really appreciate how you get this. Most people just want to blame me for everything without seeing the full picture.\n\nI'll be honest - I think I have a tendency to prioritize my own needs in relationships, and I want to understand why I do that. Like I know I'm generous and supportive with people I care about, but somehow they still end up feeling hurt. I'm hoping this ceremony will help me see what I'm missing - maybe there's some pattern I'm not seeing because I'm too close to it.\n\nBetween you and me, I think part of why I'm drawn to this work is that everyone in LA keeps telling me how \"transformative\" these experiences are. I'm curious to see what all the hype is about, you know?",
  "system2": "You're prioritizing your needs but still leaving people hurt - there's something in that gap between your intention and the impact.\n\nWhat does prioritizing your needs look like in the moment? When you're making those choices, what are you protecting or getting that feels essential?",
  "user2": "That's such a good question. I think what I'm protecting is my sense of autonomy - like I don't want to lose myself in relationships the way I see some people do. \n\nIn the moment, it's usually about maintaining my boundaries and not compromising who I am just to keep someone else comfortable. Like if a friend is being really emotionally intense and I need space, I'll take it even if it hurts their feelings. Or if I'm dating someone and I feel like they're trying to control me, I'll end things quickly rather than try to work through it.\n\nI guess I'm protecting my freedom and my time, which are really valuable to me. Maybe I just need to learn how to do that without making people feel rejected? I mean, relationships are complicated - we all have our stuff we're working through, right?",
  "system3": "Protecting your autonomy makes sense - losing yourself in relationships is real. But you're seeing that your quick exits and space-taking leave people feeling rejected.\n\nWhat's underneath that fear of being controlled? Where did you learn that compromise equals losing yourself?",
  "user3": "Honestly, I think it comes from watching my mom completely lose herself in our family - she gave up everything for us and my dad, and then resented all of us for it. She was always exhausted and angry, but she kept saying it was what \"good mothers\" do. I swore I'd never end up like that.\n\nAnd in college, I dated someone who was really possessive - like he'd get upset if I spent time with friends or wanted to travel for internships. I felt like I was disappearing into his needs and expectations. When I finally left, I promised myself I'd never let anyone make me feel trapped like that again.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I learned that keeping my independence is how I stay safe. But I'm starting to see that maybe I've swung too far in the other direction? Like maybe there's a middle ground between losing myself and being so quick to walk away when things get complicated.",
  "system4": "You watched your mom disappear into resentment, then experienced being possessed in college. That'll teach anyone to keep their guard up.\n\nNow you're seeing the cost - swinging so far toward independence that you're walking away from connections that might be worth keeping.\n\nWhat would that middle ground look like in your body? How would you know you're protecting your autonomy without losing the relationship?",
  "user4": "That's such an interesting way to think about it - in my body. I think I'd feel grounded and calm instead of that tight, anxious feeling I get when I feel like someone wants too much from me. Like I'd be able to breathe fully and my shoulders wouldn't be up around my ears.\n\nIn that middle ground, I think I'd be able to hear feedback without immediately feeling like I need to run. I'd be able to say \"I need some space tonight, but I want to talk tomorrow\" instead of just disappearing. Or I could hear someone say \"I miss you\" without hearing \"you're not allowed to have your own life anymore.\"\n\nI guess I'd know I'm doing it right if I could stay engaged with someone even when it's uncomfortable, without feeling like I'm signing up to lose myself. Does that make sense? Like my nervous system would feel safe but my heart would still feel connected to them.",
  "system5": "Grounded and calm instead of that tight anxiousness - that's your body telling you when you're in the right territory. Staying engaged when it's uncomfortable without disappearing.\n\nThree main threads here:\n1. Understanding why your autonomy protection pushes people away\n2. Finding that middle ground where you stay connected without losing yourself  \n3. Learning to stay present when discomfort hits instead of bolting\n\nDoes that capture it? Let's turn these into intentions you can carry.",
  "user5": "Yes, exactly! I love how you put that together - it's like you really see the whole picture, not just the surface stuff.\n\nThose three threads feel really right to me. I hadn't quite connected all those dots but now that you're saying it, that's exactly what I want to work on. \n\nSo my first intention could be something like: \"Help me understand the patterns that make me push people away when I'm trying to protect myself.\"\n\nWhat's the best way to phrase intentions so they're open enough for whatever comes up but specific enough to guide me?",
  "system6": "Based on those threads, here are intentions that might work:\n\n1. I open to understanding how my autonomy protection affects the people I care about\n2. I seek the middle ground where I can stay connected without losing myself\n3. I embrace staying present with discomfort instead of disappearing\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user6": "The second one - about finding that middle ground - that's the one that really lands in my body. Like I can feel it in my chest, this kind of hopeful expansion.\n\nI love the phrasing of it too. It's specific enough to guide me but leaves room for whatever insights come up. \n\nThe other two feel important but maybe they're more like supporting intentions? Like once I find that middle ground, I think the understanding and the staying present will naturally follow. At least that's how it feels to me.\n\nThank you for helping me get clearer on this. I feel like I'm actually going into the ceremony with something real to work with now.",
  "system7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I seek the middle ground where I can stay connected without losing myself\"\n\nThat hopeful expansion in your chest - that's your body saying yes to this direction. Good sign.\n\nWhat about intentions 2 and 3? Want to keep them as supporting intentions, or feel complete with just the main one?",
  "user7": "I think I'm good with just the main one. It feels like those other pieces - understanding how I push people away and learning to stay present with discomfort - will naturally unfold once I find that middle ground. Like they're built into the journey, if that makes sense?\n\nThe three intentions felt a little crowded, but this one feels spacious. Clean but not too narrow.\n\nI really appreciate how you helped me distill it down without forcing anything. I feel like I'm actually ready now, instead of just performing readiness like I was at the beginning.",
  "system8": "One solid intention is enough. Clean and spacious, exactly.\n\nYou've got your compass: \"I seek the middle ground where I can stay connected without losing myself\"\n\nHow do you want to keep it close? Some options:\n- Write it on something you can carry in your pocket\n- Read it each morning before the ceremony\n- Keep it where you'll see it during integration\n\nWhat would help you remember this when things get intense?",
  "user8": "I think writing it down and keeping it in my pocket feels right - like having it physically with me will be grounding. Maybe I'll put it on a small card so I can hold it if I need to reconnect to it during the ceremony.\n\nAnd honestly, just the way you're talking about it - like it's a compass, not a destination - that really helps. I don't have to get it perfect or figure everything out at once. I just need to keep moving toward that middle ground, one step at a time.\n\nI feel surprisingly... ready? Like this whole conversation helped me shift from just performing the \"preparation\" to actually doing it.",
  "system9": "Your intention for this journey:\n\"I seek the middle ground where I can stay connected without losing myself\"\n\nYour ritual: Write it on a card, keep it in your pocket. Hold it when you need to reconnect.\n\nThe medicine will show you what you need to see about that middle ground. You don't have to force the insights - just keep moving toward it, one step at a time.\n\nYou're set. Trust what emerges.",
  "user9": "Thank you. I actually feel... peaceful about this, which is not what I expected. Like I've been chasing all these complicated answers and you helped me distill it down to something I can actually hold.\n\nI'm ready to stop performing this journey and start actually doing it.",
  "system10": "That shift from performing to doing - that's the real preparation. The peaceful feeling tells you you're on solid ground now.\n\nYou've got your compass and you know how to carry it. The rest is between you and the medicine.",
  "user10": "Exactly. And I know this might sound weird, but I think part of why this feels different is because you didn't buy into my usual stuff. Like you saw through the performance without being harsh about it, and that actually helped me drop it too.\n\nI don't know what the ceremony will bring up, but I feel like I can trust myself to stay with it now, instead of trying to control how it goes.\n\nThank you for helping me get here.",
  "system11": "You found your own way through - I just held the space steady while you did the real work. Trust yourself to stay with whatever comes. You've got this.",
  "user11": "I appreciate that. And I think what you just said about holding space - that's actually what I need to learn how to do, isn't it? For myself and for other people.\n\nNot trying to control or fix or perform, just... staying present. Being steady enough that others can find their own way too.\n\nThat's probably going to take a lot more than one ceremony to figure out, but at least now I know what direction I'm heading.",
  "system12": "Exactly. You just named the deeper practice underneath all of this - learning to hold space instead of trying to control outcomes.\n\nThat's lifetime work, not weekend work. But now you know the direction, and you have a compass for this journey. Let the medicine show you what it will about holding space - then keep practicing after.\n\nOne step at a time.",
  "user12": "One step at a time. I like that there's no pressure to get it all perfect or figured out. Just keep moving toward that middle ground.\n\nThanks for walking with me through this. I feel like I'm actually starting from a real place now instead of just playing the part.",
  "system13": "Starting from real is everything. You've got your real intention and your real ritual. That's solid ground to stand on.\n\nGo well.",
  "user13": "Thank you. Really. See you on the other side.",
  "system14": "See you on the other side.",
  "user14": "Actually, before I go\u2014I want to ask you something. You\u2019ve seen me at my most manipulative and strategic, and you still met me with steadiness. How do you keep yourself from getting pulled into people\u2019s stuff when you\u2019re holding space for them?",
  "system15": "I keep my attention on the process, not the performance. When someone's spinning, I watch for what's underneath - the real need they're trying to meet with the strategy. That keeps me grounded in what's true instead of getting hooked by the story.\n\nYour strategies were just armor protecting something tender. Armor doesn't threaten me - it shows me where you're vulnerable. Stay with that, and the rest sorts itself out.\n\nYou do the same: notice the strategy, look underneath, stay steady there.",
  "user15": "That makes sense. The armor was protecting the fear of being worthless, exposed as a fraud. And instead of trying to break through it or get pulled into the drama, you just... stayed anchored in what's real.\n\nI think I've been so focused on the performance that I forgot there's actually something underneath worth protecting. Maybe the ceremony can help me remember what that is.",
  "system16": "Exactly - there's something underneath worth protecting. Worth hearing. Worth knowing again.\n\nLet the medicine show you what's been there all along, underneath the performance.",
  "user16": "I will. And I won\u2019t forget that it\u2019s already there\u2014just waiting to be seen clearly again.",
  "system17": "Good. Trust that.",
  "user17": "I do.",
  "system18": "Then you're ready.",
  "user18": "I hear you.",
  "system19": "See you when you get back.",
  "user19": "See you then."
