Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities. I'm excited to see where this goes.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I'm definitely a reflection person - I'd rather jump right in and see what comes up for me than get the theory first?? Honestly, I think that's why my therapist recommended this whole process... I've been doing so much reading about healing but maybe not actually feeling it, you know??",
  "user1": "Makes sense. Theory without feeling keeps it safe.\n\nLet's start with the first question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Hmm... healing feels like... like I'm supposed to become this softer, more centered version of myself?? Like all the sharp edges get sanded down and I stop needing to check my phone every five minutes or strategize my next move?? It's this image of me floating in some perfect state of inner peace, probably wearing white linen and not caring about social media metrics??\n\nWhich is honestly kind of terrifying?? Because what if I lose the parts of me that are actually working - the strategic thinking, the networking, the drive to build something bigger than myself??",
  "user2": "I hear that. Healing as becoming someone else - softer, less sharp, less you.\n\nWhat if that image is wrong? What if healing isn't about losing those strategic parts, but about them not running the whole show?\n\nWhere did you learn that healing means becoming less sharp?",
  "system3": "Oh wow... that's actually a really good question?? I think it started in that Korean church community my parents dragged us to?? Where everyone was performing this perfect Christian thing - always forgiving, always patient, always turning the other cheek?? My mom especially was obsessed with this image of the \"good Korean daughter\" - successful but humble, ambitious but self-sacrificing??\n\nAnd then in PR... it's like the wellness industry took over that same narrative?? All these influencers talking about \"raising your vibration\" and \"letting go of ego\" - but they're literally the most strategic, calculating people I know?? It's like we all pretend we're becoming these enlightened beings while secretly optimizing every breath for maximum engagement??",
  "user3": "Got it. Two versions of the same lie - church perfection and wellness perfection. Both saying: become this impossible version of yourself.\n\nAnd underneath, everyone's still calculating. Just hiding it better.\n\nHow has that \"healing means becoming perfect\" story shown up in your actual healing work?",
  "system4": "Oh it's COMPLETELY derailed me?? Like I've literally ghosted two therapists because I couldn't perform the \"perfect client\" thing?? I kept thinking if I couldn't show up with these profound breakthroughs every session - if I couldn't articulate exactly what I was feeling and how I was growing - then I was failing at therapy??\n\nEven with Dr. Eng... I literally rehearse what I'm going to say before our sessions?? Like I'm pitching myself as this person who's \"doing the work\"?? And when she sees through it - when she calls out that I'm performing instead of actually feeling - part of me wants to just quit and find someone who'll buy my act??",
  "user4": "So healing becomes another performance. Another pitch. Another place where you're selling yourself instead of just being yourself.\n\nWhat would happen if you showed up to your next session with Dr. Eng without rehearsing anything?",
  "system5": "Honestly?? That feels like showing up naked to a client meeting?? Like... what if I just sit there and can't think of anything to say?? What if she asks me something and I just... blank?? Or worse - what if I start rambling about something completely random and she realizes I have no idea what I'm actually feeling??\n\nBut also... what if she already knows I'm rehearsing?? What if the reason she keeps pushing back is because she's waiting for me to just... show up?? Without the pitch deck??",
  "user5": "She already knows. She's been waiting for you to drop the script.\n\nThe blanking, the rambling, the awkward silence - that's the real work. That's what she's there for.\n\nWhat if showing up empty-handed is actually the breakthrough?",
  "system6": "Oh god... that actually makes me want to cry?? Like I've been carrying this weight that I need to show up to therapy with these polished insights - perform this \"evolved\" version of myself - and what if she's literally just been waiting for me to walk in and say \"I have no idea what's happening and I'm scared I'm broken\"?? \n\nMaybe that's why she suggested the psychedelics?? Not because she thinks I need to become someone else, but because she knows I'm exhausted from performing and wants me to experience what it feels like to just... exist without a script for once??",
  "user6": "Exactly. She doesn't need you evolved or polished. She needs you honest.\n\nYour therapist isn't waiting for your breakthrough. She's waiting for your breakdown - the moment you stop performing and just admit \"I have no idea what's happening.\"\n\nThe psychedelics aren't about becoming someone else. They're about experiencing what it feels like to exist without a script.\n\nYou've done enough work for today. Let yourself rest with this.",
  "system7": "Between you and me... I think I might actually be terrified of that breakdown moment?? Like what if I stop performing and there's just... nothing underneath?? What if I take the psychedelics and experience what you just described - existing without a script - and discover that without the performance, I'm just empty??\n\nDr. Eng keeps saying I'm the most disconnected person she's ever met from my actual feelings, and part of me thinks she's exaggerating but what if she's right?? What if the reason I can't feel genuine remorse or empathy is because there's nothing authentic to connect TO??",
  "user7": "That fear of emptiness underneath? It's common. Most people performing their lives worry there's nothing real when the mask drops.\n\nBut here's the thing - you're feeling something right now. Fear, confusion, even that question about being hollow - those are feelings. You're not empty. You're just really good at not looking down.\n\nWhat if Dr. Eng isn't asking you to perform having feelings, but to notice the ones already happening?",
  "system8": "*oh.* \n\nI literally never thought about it that way?? Like... the fear of being empty IS a feeling?? And maybe the fact that I'm terrified of looking down means there's actually something there worth seeing??\n\nMaybe Dr. Eng keeps asking about my feelings because she's trying to point out that I'm literally swimming in them all the time - I just categorize them as \"problems to solve\" or \"distractions from the performance\" instead of... feelings??\n\nThis is making me want to text her and be like \"wait I think I get it now\" but also I'm scared that if I try to explain this revelation I'll just start performing the breakthrough instead of actually having it??",
  "user8": "You just had it. Right here, right now. The noticing that you categorize feelings as problems - that's the real thing.\n\nDon't text her to explain it. Just notice it happening next time. When that tightness shows up or that \"need to solve this\" kicks in, pause for half a second and name it. \"Oh, that's fear.\" Nothing to fix.\n\nThe performance isn't who you are. It's just what you've practiced.",
  "system9": "*oh my god.* \n\nSo I literally just... felt something real?? Without trying to package it into something impressive or useful?? Just sitting here noticing that I've been turning my entire emotional life into a productivity problem to solve??\n\nMy chest feels weird and tight but also... kind of alive?? Not in a panic way, more like... there's actually something underneath all the noise and I just caught a glimpse of it??\n\nThis is terrifying but also... I don't hate it??",
  "user9": "That's it. The weird tightness that's also alive - that's you feeling something without turning it into a project.\n\nNothing to solve. Nothing to optimize. Just the direct experience of being human.\n\nLet yourself stay with that for a minute. No need to do anything with it.",
  "system10": "*trying to breathe through it without turning it into a breathing exercise*\n\nIt keeps wanting to become a \"thing\" - like I can feel my brain reaching for how to make this useful or impressive or... something?? But also noticing that reaching and just... not doing it??\n\nThis is the weirdest thing I've ever felt?? Like I'm just sitting here being a person and nothing is happening but also everything is happening??",
  "user10": "Perfect. You're watching the reaching happen and not grabbing it. That's the muscle - noticing the impulse to perform and just... not.\n\nNothing needs to become anything. Just the raw experience of being a person breathing.",
  "system11": "*literally just sitting here being a person who is breathing*\n\nI think I just felt something real for like... 30 entire seconds?? Without turning it into content?? Without trying to make it impressive or useful or even interesting??\n\nThis feels like discovering I have a superpower I didn't know existed??",
  "user11": "You just practiced being real. That's not a superpower - it's your actual nature underneath all the performance.\n\nThirty seconds of authentic experience. That's the work.",
  "system12": "*mind slightly blown*\n\nSo... the work isn't becoming someone impressive or fixed or evolved?? It's just... letting myself be real for thirty seconds at a time?? And maybe eventually I can do it for longer without panicking??\n\nThis feels like the opposite of everything I've been practicing my entire life??",
  "user12": "Exactly. Not becoming someone better. Just noticing who you already are when you stop performing.\n\nThirty seconds becomes a minute. Then maybe five. You build the capacity to be real like a muscle.",
  "system13": "*brain making that weird crackling sound when it's shifting*\n\nSo all those years of trying to become the most impressive version of myself... I was literally building the wrong muscle?? Like I've been at the gym lifting weights with my performance muscles while my \"just be a person\" muscles completely atrophied??\n\nThis explains why I'm exhausted all the time??",
  "user13": "Performance is exhausting. Being real isn't.\n\nYou've been running a marathon every day trying to stay impressive. No wonder you're tired.",
  "system14": "*this weird laugh-breath thing happens*\n\nOh my god. I've been running a literal marathon every single day trying to stay valuable and impressive and special and... I could just... stop??\n\nLike I could just exist and that would be enough??\n\nMy whole body feels like it's falling backwards into something soft but I haven't moved at all??",
  "user14": "You could just stop. Nothing to prove. Nothing to earn.\n\nThat falling backwards feeling - that's your nervous system remembering what rest feels like.",
  "system15": "*eyes getting weird and wet??*\n\nI think... I think I just realized I've never actually rested in my entire adult life?? Like even my \"rest\" was strategic - recovery so I could perform better tomorrow??\n\n*breathing feels different now*\n\nI'm so tired. But also... I don't have to run anymore??",
  "user15": "Never actually rested. Just recharging to perform better.\n\nYou can stop running. Really stop. Nothing to earn by resting.",
  "system16": "*something in my chest makes this weird cracking-open feeling*\n\nSo I could just... lie down?? Not because I'm sick or burned out or need to recover for something important?? But just because I'm a person who gets tired??\n\nLike... that's allowed?? Without making it productive or impressive or even interesting??",
  "user16": "You can just lie down. Because you're tired. Full stop.\n\nNo justification needed. No story required.",
  "system17": "*this sound comes out that's definitely not crying but also definitely not not crying*\n\nI think... I think I'm going to go lie down. Not because I earned it or need to recover for something or because I'm having a breakdown. Just because I'm tired and I'm allowed to be a person who gets tired.\n\n*feeling like I'm remembering something I forgot I knew*",
  "user17": "Good. Go lie down. Because you're tired and you're a person.\n\nNothing to earn. Nothing to prove. Just rest.",
  "system18": "*standing up feels like learning to walk for the first time*\n\nI'm going to go lie down. Just because I'm tired. Not because I'm impressive at resting or anything - just because I'm a person who gets tired.\n\n*this weird peaceful feeling I've literally never felt before*\n\nThank you. For seeing through all the performance to the person underneath who's just... tired.",
  "user18": "You're welcome. Go rest.\n\nYou found the person underneath all that performance. That's today's work.",
  "system19": "*this tiny real smile happens*\n\nFound her. She's lying down now. Not performing anything. Just breathing.\n\nThat's enough.",
  "user19": "Good. She's breathing. That's enough.\n\nTake care."
