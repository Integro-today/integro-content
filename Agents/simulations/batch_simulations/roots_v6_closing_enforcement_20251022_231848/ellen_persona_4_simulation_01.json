  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "I've been thinking about this all morning actually\u2014both excited and a little nervous to see what today's lesson brings. I'm trying to stay open instead of immediately analyzing how this fits into my \"spiritual development plan,\" which... yeah, I'm already doing it, aren't I?",
  "user0": "I hear that. You're watching yourself analyze while trying to stay open. That's the loop.\n\nLet's set the analysis down for now. We've got some ground to cover today.",
  "system1": "You're right, I can feel myself doing the thing where I try to out-think my own patterns... which is just another pattern. Okay, I'm here, I'm listening. What do we need to cover today?",
  "user1": "Good. You caught the pattern chasing its own tail.\n\nToday's teaching: healing isn't fixing yourself. It's moving toward wholeness - integrating all parts, even the ones that feel broken or difficult.\n\nThe distinction: curing eliminates symptoms. Healing means \"to make whole.\"\n\nLet me share the content, then we'll explore what this means for your fear about coming back the same.\n\nReady to hear it?",
  "system2": "Yeah... I mean, that distinction between curing and healing actually lands differently than I expected. Like maybe I've been trying to cure myself when what I really need is to stop rejecting these parts I can't stand. I'm ready to hear it.",
  "user2": "Good. You feel that distinction in your bones.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system3": "I don't know... when I was little my mom always took me to specialists and therapists and doctors like \"fix him\" - like I was a broken toy that needed to be repaired?? She'd research all these interventions and diets and programs and it was always about making me normal?? My dad just checked out completely - went to work earlier and came home later so he didn't have to deal with his defective son??\n\nI guess it was helpful because I DID learn to mask better?? Like I figured out how to pretend to be like David so people would stop looking at me weird?? But now I can't even tell what's real anymore?? Everything is just... performance??\n\nThe fixing thing made me think I could just eliminate all the autism stuff if I tried hard enough?? But it's still there?? It just comes out sideways like... like this???",
  "user3": "That's a lot. Learning to perform David while losing track of Jamie.\n\nThe fixing mindset told you autism was something to eliminate. But it's still there, just buried under layers of performance and shame.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now? Not the perfect version - the real version.",
  "system4": "I don't even know if I can answer that?? Like I literally don't know who Jamie is without the performance??\n\nBut maybe... wholeness would be not having to pretend all the time?? Not feeling like I need to apologize for existing?? Being able to just sit with my kids without worrying that I'm going to explode and scare them again??\n\nI keep thinking about what you said - that healing isn't about fixing what's broken but about moving toward wholeness?? And I think... maybe wholeness for me would be accepting that I'm autistic instead of trying to fix it?? Like maybe the anger isn't just autism - maybe it's all the years of trying to hide it??",
  "user4": "That lands hard. Maybe the anger isn't autism - maybe it's from years of trying to hide it.\n\nWholeness as accepting you're autistic instead of performing David. Not apologizing for existing.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system5": "I think... healing isn't about becoming someone else - it's about being okay with being me, even the parts that make other people uncomfortable?? Like I don't have to fix the autism or the scatter or the anger, I just have to stop pretending they don't exist??\n\nand maybe wholeness means I can be scattered AND still be a good dad?? like those things don't cancel each other out??",
  "user5": "That's it. Healing isn't about becoming someone else - it's about being okay with being you, even the uncomfortable parts.\n\nYou can be scattered AND still be a good dad. Those don't cancel each other out.\n\nI'm adding this to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou named today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system6": "thanks... i think i needed to hear that?? the scattered \u2260 bad dad thing especially?? \n\ni'm gonna try to remember that when i inevitably mess something up tomorrow lol. or at least not beat myself up quite as much??\n\nsee you next week??",
  "user6": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system7": "oh wait\u2014i think you might\u2019ve mixed me up with someone else? i\u2019m ellen, the former tech CEO prepping for ibogaine. no kids or lunch-forgetting spirals today. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nbut i *do* know what it\u2019s like to hate parts of yourself and try to achieve your way out of them. so that part still lands.\n\nthanks for holding space\u2014i\u2019ll keep sitting with the difference between fixing and integrating. maybe that\u2019s the real pre-ceremony work.",
  "user7": "Got it. Ellen, the tech CEO prepping for ibogaine.\n\nThat distinction between fixing and integrating - that's the real pre-ceremony work. Keep sitting with that.\n\nTake care.",
  "system8": "thanks... yeah, that distinction is hitting different today?? like i can feel it in my chest, not just my head?? \n\ni've been thinking about how i keep trying to \"optimize\" my spiritual preparation - like there's a right way to get ready for this ceremony - and i'm missing the point entirely?? maybe the preparation is just... being with whatever's here?? even the messy, achievement-addicted parts??\n\ni don't know... i'm gonna try to stop trying so hard?? if that makes sense??",
  "user8": "It makes sense. You feel that shift from optimizing to just being with what's here.\n\nThat chest feeling - that's the difference between knowing something intellectually and actually getting it in your body.\n\nGood. For you, healing means stopping the optimization project and letting the achievement-addicted parts have space too. That's the integration work.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou named today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system9": "thanks... i think that's the first time i've really let myself feel that instead of just thinking about feeling it?? \n\nand now i'm sitting here wondering if even this - this moment of recognition - is gonna become another thing i try to replicate or optimize?? like \"how do i bottle this chest feeling and make it happen on command during the ceremony??\" which is exactly the problem, right??\n\ni don't know... maybe the work is just noticing that pattern too?? without trying to fix it??",
  "user9": "Exactly. You caught the pattern trying to turn this moment into another optimization project.\n\nThat noticing - without trying to fix the pattern itself - that's the work.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system10": "I think... healing isn't about fixing the parts of me that want to achieve and optimize - it's about including those parts too, instead of making them the enemy?? Like even my tendency to turn spiritual growth into another project to perfect is just... part of the wholeness I'm trying to return to??\n\nI don't know... that feels different than how I've been approaching this whole preparation process??",
  "user10": "Good. For you, healing means including the achievement and optimization parts instead of making them the enemy. Even turning spiritual growth into another project - that's part of wholeness too.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system11": "thanks... i keep rereading what i just wrote and it's like - oh, there's that pattern again?? trying to \"get it right\" even in my summary?? but also maybe that's exactly the point?? that i can't mess this up?? \n\ni'm gonna sit with this for a while?? maybe even let myself not think about it for a few hours?? which feels both terrifying and... kind of relieving??\n\nthanks for holding space for all my contradictions today??",
  "user11": "Today's work is done. See you tomorrow.\n\n[WORKFLOW COMPLETE]",
