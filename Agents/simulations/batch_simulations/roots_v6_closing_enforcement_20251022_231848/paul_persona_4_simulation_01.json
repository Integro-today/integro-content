  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Got accepted into Heroic Hearts. Headed to Costa Rica in three weeks. Amanda thinks this'll help. I dont know.",
  "user0": "Got it. Big step ahead.\n\nThree weeks gives you time to prepare. What feels uncertain right now - the journey itself, or what comes after?",
  "system1": "Mostly what comes after. I can handle the ceremony\u2014been through worse. But what if I come back and Im still the same asshole who cant sit through dinner without snapping? What if Amanda leaves anyway?",
  "user1": "That fear makes sense. The \"what if nothing changes\" terror.\n\nHealing isn't about becoming a different person. It's about integrating all parts of yourself - even the parts that snap at dinner.\n\nWhat's your current relationship with that part of you that can't sit through meals peacefully?",
  "system2": "I hate that part. Feels weak. Like I should be able to control it but I cant. And then I hate myself more for losing it in front of them.",
  "user2": "Got it. You hate that part. See it as weak, out of control.\n\nBut here's the thing - that part is trying to protect you somehow. Maybe it's guarding against feeling overwhelmed, or keeping people at a safe distance.\n\nWhat would happen if you got curious about what it's actually trying to do for you, instead of just hating it?",
  "system3": "idk man. feels like if i stop hating it then im saying its okay that i scare my kids and cant sleep and maybe lose amanda. \n\nbut i guess... i guess the anger does keep people away. so they dont see how bad it really is.",
  "user3": "That makes sense. The anger creates distance so nobody sees the real mess.\n\nBut you're already seeing it. And you're here, which means some part of you is ready for something different.\n\nWhere has the \"fix what's broken\" perspective been helpful in your life, and where has it limited you?",
  "system4": "Helped me stay alive over there. Kept me focused on the mission, not the bodies.\n\nHere though? Makes me treat my family like problems to solve. Michael Jr gets a C in math - gotta fix it. Sarah cries - gotta fix it. Amanda says shes lonely - gotta fix it. \n\nNever just... sits with them.",
  "user4": "You learned to survive by fixing. Kept you alive in combat.\n\nNow that same reflex turns your family into missions. Cries become problems to solve, not moments to witness.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now? Not the perfect version - just... what feels more whole than this constant fixing?",
  "system5": "idk man. maybe just... not feeling like i gotta be on patrol all the time? like amanda could just sit next to me without me bracing for the next thing that needs fixing. \n\nfeels like if i could just... be there. not scanning for threats. not planning how to handle the next crisis. just... sitting with her. maybe thats wholeness?",
  "user5": "That's it. Not being on patrol. Just sitting with her without bracing for impact.\n\nThat sounds like a moment of wholeness - even with all the challenges still there.\n\nCan you recall any time when you felt more whole, even briefly, even if the struggles hadn't disappeared?",
  "system6": "yeah. last month amanda asked me to sit with her on the porch after the kids were asleep. usually i make excuses but i just... did it. we didnt talk about anything important. just watched the neighbor's dog chase moths around their yard for like twenty minutes. \n\ni wasnt relaxed exactly but i wasnt waiting for something to explode either. just there. she put her head on my shoulder and i didnt flinch away. \n\nnightmare came anyway but for those twenty minutes i wasnt a time bomb. just a guy on a porch with his wife.",
  "user6": "Good. For you, healing means being a guy on a porch with his wife for twenty minutes - not relaxed but not bracing for explosion. Just there.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system7": "thanks. i guess... i dont know. maybe this whole thing isnt as stupid as i thought. \n\nsee you tomorrow.",
  "user7": "Today's work is done. See you tomorrow.\n\n[WORKFLOW COMPLETE]",
