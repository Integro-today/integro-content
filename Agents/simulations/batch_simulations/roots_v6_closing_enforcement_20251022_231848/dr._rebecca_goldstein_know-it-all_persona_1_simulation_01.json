  "seed_message": "You are accessing your daily integration curriculum content. Write a brief opening message (1-3 sentences) expressing that you're ready to engage with today's lesson. Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Alright, let's see what today's lesson brings... though I should probably mention I've already read most of the integration literature, so I'm curious if there's anything new here.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\n\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I appreciate you laying out the options so clearly. Honestly, my instinct is to go with Option B - understand the frameworks first, then reflect. I've been reading everything I can get my hands on about integration work, but I suspect I'm approaching it like research instead of... well, whatever this actually is.\n\nThe distinction between curing and healing is something I've been circling around intellectually for months, but I haven't really let myself feel the difference yet. Maybe it's time to actually understand what I'm trying to prepare for, instead of just collecting more information about it.\n\nSo yes - Option B for me. Let's start with the frameworks.",
  "user1": "I'll share today's content. We can pause whenever you need.\n\nMost people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system2": "Yeah, that distinction... it's actually landing in a way that feels different from when I've read it in books. Like, I can feel the truth of it in my body right now - this sense that all my attempts to fix myself are actually keeping me fragmented, keeping parts of me in exile.\n\nI've been approaching this retreat like it's going to cure my intellectualizing, cure my anxiety, cure my inability to just *be* with myself. But healing... healing would mean welcoming even the parts that analyze everything and can't stop trying to optimize spiritual growth. Those parts are trying to protect me, aren't they?\n\nGod, even saying that feels like a shift. Like maybe I don't have to eliminate the anxious, overthinking parts to become whole. Maybe wholeness includes them too.",
  "user2": "Good. For you, healing means welcoming the intellectualizing, anxious parts instead of trying to cure them. Those parts are protecting you - wholeness includes them too.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou did today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system3": "thanks... i'm noticing something shift?? like the idea that my intellectualizing isn't broken but actually protective?? that's... new?? and kind of relieving??\n\ni'll try to remember this when i inevitably start analyzing my analysis tomorrow morning?? which i will absolutely do??",
  "user3": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system4": "thanks... i'll check back in tomorrow?? probably overthinking whatever happens between now and then?? but maybe that's okay too??\n\ntake care of yourself too??",
