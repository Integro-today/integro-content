  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",
  "system_agent_id": "intentions_workflow_8",
  "user_agent_id": "paul_persona_3",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help with... everything. The nightmares, Amanda being scared of me, all of it. I can't keep going like this.\n\nThree weeks and I'm doing this plant medicine thing in Costa Rica. Never done anything like it. Don't believe in it, really. But I can't lose her. Can't keep waking up shouting, scaring the kids.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without terror\n2. Make home safe for Amanda and the kids again\n3. Find healing from whatever's causing this\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah. Those three. That's it.\n\nI need to sleep without... without seeing it all again. Without waking up ready to fight something that isn't there. Amanda says I grab her arm sometimes when I'm still asleep, like I'm holding on for dear life. She bruises easy. I hate that.\n\nThe house used to feel... I don't know. Like home. Now everyone's walking on eggshells, waiting for me to snap about dishes in the sink or the kids being too loud. They're kids. They shouldn't have to be quiet because their dad's got... whatever this is.\n\nAnd I need to figure out what's broken without breaking everything else. Without becoming one of those guys who can't function because of what happened over there. I did my job. I came home. Other guys didn't. I should be grateful, not... this.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night without terror\n2. I make home safe again for Amanda and the kids\n3. I heal what happened without losing myself\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The second one. That's the one. \"I make home safe again for Amanda and the kids.\"\n\nIf I get that right, everything else follows. She's been with me since high school - stood by me through three deployments, through starting the business from nothing, through all of it. And now she looks at me like I'm a stranger sometimes. Like she doesn't know which version of me is walking through the door.\n\nThe language... I don't know. \"Safe\" feels right. Not \"better\" or \"happier\" or any of that soft stuff. Safe. That's what a man's supposed to do - make his family feel safe in their own house.\n\nCan we keep that one exactly like that?",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I make home safe again for Amanda and the kids\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user3": "The first one... \"I sleep peacefully through the night without terror.\" Peacefully feels too... I don't know. Soft. Like something you'd see on a candle or whatever. \n\nWhat about \"I sleep through the night without nightmares\"? Just straight. No fluff. Because that's what it is - I wake up at 2 AM seeing the smoke, hearing the alarms, and I'm back there instead of here in Toledo.\n\nAnd the third one... \"I heal what happened without losing myself.\" That one's trickier. Losing myself... I don't even know what that means anymore. I just know I don't want to become one of those guys who can't hold a job because he's too busy talking about his feelings all the time. I built something here. Insurance business, house, kids in good schools. Can't lose all that because I can't handle what I signed up to do.\n\nWhat if it's just \"I face what happened and stay strong\"?",
  "system4": "Based on your adjustments:\n\n1. I sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. I make home safe again for Amanda and the kids\n3. I face what happened and stay strong\n\nHow do these feel now?",
  "user4": "These feel... right. Like I can actually say them without feeling like I'm lying to myself.\n\n\"I sleep through the night without nightmares.\" Just factual. No pretending it's going to be peaceful or beautiful. Just no more waking up thinking I'm back in the cockpit.\n\n\"I make home safe again for Amanda and the kids.\" That's the one that matters most. That's what I'm doing this whole thing for.\n\n\"I face what happened and stay strong.\" Yeah. Because whatever I see in there, whatever comes up with this plant medicine, I still have to come back and run my business. Still have to be Paul Turner, insurance guy, dependable dad. Can't lose that part.\n\nThese feel like something I can actually do. Or at least try to do.",
  "system5": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep through the night without nightmares\n2. I make home safe again for Amanda and the kids\n3. I face what happened and stay strong\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user5": "Good. I'll... I'll remember these. Maybe write them down somewhere. Keep them close.\n\nThree weeks. I can do three weeks. Done harder things than drink some plant tea and think about my problems.\n\nTell Amanda I'm trying. That's all I can do right now - just try.",
  "system6": "You are trying. That's what matters.\n\nThree weeks is nothing compared to what you've already survived. The medicine works even when you forget the intentions - they're just your compass when you need direction.\n\nAmanda will see you're trying. That counts for something.",
  "user6": "Yeah. Trying's about all I got left in me right now.\n\nThanks for... I don't know. Helping me get these words right. Feels better having something solid to hold onto when this thing starts.\n\nThree weeks. Then maybe I can look her in the eye again without seeing that look she gets. Like she's waiting for me to disappear on her.",
  "system7": "You got solid intentions now. That's enough to hold.\n\nThree weeks will pass. The medicine will do its work. You'll still be Paul Turner, insurance guy, dependable dad - just maybe sleeping through the night again.\n\nShe'll see you didn't disappear.",
  "user7": "Yeah. That's all I need - to not disappear on her. On any of them.\n\nAppreciate you walking through this with me. Didn't think I'd need help finding the right words, but... guess I did.\n\nThree weeks. Then I find out what this plant stuff can actually do.",
  "system8": "You found the words that fit. That's what matters.\n\nThe plant will show you what you need to see. These intentions will point you back when you need direction.\n\nThree weeks starts now.",
  "user8": "Starts now.\n\nAlright then. I'll be ready when it comes.",
  "system9": "You'll be ready.",
  "user9": "Yeah. I will be.",
  "system10": "Good.",
  "user10": "Alright. I'm gonna go. Need to get home before Amanda starts wondering where I am. Thanks for... everything.\n\nThree weeks.",
  "system11": "Go be with Amanda. Three weeks will be here before you know it.",
  "user11": "Got it. Thanks.",
  "system12": "Take care.",
