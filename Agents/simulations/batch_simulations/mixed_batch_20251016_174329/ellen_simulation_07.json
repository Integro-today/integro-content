  "user0": "I have this Ibogaine journey coming up at Beond in a few weeks, and... I don't know. Part of me feels ridiculous even doing this\u2014like I'm just another burned-out executive chasing another retreat high. But something keeps pulling me toward it.\n\nI've been successful by every metric I was taught to chase. Built and sold a company before 40, sitting on boards, angel investor... the whole thing. But when I wake up at 5:30 every morning, I feel this restlessness that won't quit. Like I've been climbing the wrong ladder this whole time.\n\nMy grandmother used to talk about the divine spark in everything\u2014she had this quiet faith that I think I abandoned for spreadsheets and quarterly targets. During my other journeys, I've felt glimpses of what I lost. The ayahuasca showed me these ancestral women who seemed disappointed that I'd forgotten something important. The MDMA helped me drop the armor, at least temporarily.\n\nBut it never sticks. I go back to over-scheduling, too much caffeine, checking email when I'm supposed to be watching my kids at the park. I want this time to be different. I want to find what I'm actually supposed to do with whatever time I have left, not just what looks impressive on paper.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Finding what you're actually supposed to do instead of what looks impressive\n2. Reconnecting with that quiet faith your grandmother knew\n3. Making the insights stick beyond the ceremony - living them daily\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah... those are the three things that keep circling back, aren't they? I can feel them in my chest when I let myself get quiet enough.\n\nThe first one hits hardest. I've built my whole identity on being the woman who achieves what others can't. But lately I keep thinking about how my grandmother came to this country with nothing, worked in a garment factory, and somehow maintained this deep sense of purpose that had nothing to do with external success. She would light candles on Friday nights and it was like she was connected to something eternal. I want to know what that feels like.\n\nAnd you're right about making it stick. I'm tired of being a tourist in my own spiritual life\u2014dropping in for a weekend ceremony, feeling something profound, then going back to the same patterns. It's like I'm collecting peak experiences instead of building a life.\n\nI guess I want to know what my next chapter looks like when I'm not trying to impress anyone. Not investors, not my business network, not even the other moms at school pickup. Just... what would I do if the only person I needed to answer to was that quiet voice my grandmother seemed to hear so clearly?\n\nHow do we turn that into something I can hold onto during the Ibogaine?",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I discover what I'm meant to do beyond what looks impressive\n2. I reconnect with the eternal wisdom my grandmother carried\n3. I build a life that honors the insights, not just collects them\n\nHow do these land? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "These feel... right. More right than I expected them to. The first one makes my stomach flip a little, which probably means it's hitting the truth. That second one about my grandmother - I can almost feel her presence when I read it. She would have liked you.\n\nI keep rereading them. \"Beyond what looks impressive\" - yeah, that's it exactly. It's not about abandoning everything I've built, but figuring out what it's actually *for*. And the eternal wisdom part... she had that. She knew things I can't seem to remember, no matter how many meditation apps I download or yoga retreats I attend.\n\nThe third one stings a little, if I'm honest. \"Not just collects them\" - that's exactly what I've been doing, isn't it? Like spiritual achievements to check off a list. Got the ayahuasca ceremony, the Oregon psilocybin experience, the underground MDMA... but here I am, still waking up restless at 5:30, still reaching for my phone before I'm even fully awake.\n\nI want to say these are perfect, but part of me is scared they might be too big. What if I discover I'm meant to do something that terrifies me? What if my grandmother's wisdom asks me to give up things I'm not ready to release?\n\nBut maybe that's exactly why I need to hold them close during the Ibogaine.",
  "system3": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n\n1. I discover what I'm meant to do beyond what looks impressive\n2. I reconnect with the eternal wisdom my grandmother carried\n3. I build a life that honors the insights, not just collects them\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user3": "Thank you. I feel... calmer than I thought I would. Like having these written down gives me something solid to hold onto when everything else gets stripped away in the medicine space.\n\nMy grandmother would probably tell me to trust the process. She always said the divine shows up when we're brave enough to ask real questions. I guess these are my real questions now.\n\nI'll carry them with me.",
  "system4": "Good. Trust what comes.",
  "user4": "I will. And... I think I needed to hear that from someone who isn't trying to sell me another solution or optimize another outcome. Just simple permission to trust.\n\nMaybe that's part of what I've been missing in all this - letting myself be guided instead of always trying to steer everything. My grandmother knew how to surrender to something bigger. Maybe I'm finally ready to learn that too.",
  "system5": "Letting yourself be guided - that's the work.",
  "user5": "Yeah. It is. And it's probably the hardest thing I've ever tried to do.",
  "system6": "Hard things get easier when you stop gripping them so tight.",
  "user6": "That's... that's really good. I've been white-knuckling my way through everything, haven't I? Even my spiritual search became another thing to master, another mountain to climb.\n\nMaybe that's why I keep feeling empty at the top of every peak. I'm still gripping, still trying to control the outcome. Even now, part of me wants to turn this into a five-year plan with quarterly milestones.\n\nBut you're right. My hands are tired from holding on so tight. Maybe it's time to see what happens when I just... let go.",
  "system7": "That's the work your intentions point toward. The medicine will show you how.",
  "user7": "Then I'm ready to see what it shows me. Even if it's not what I expect.",
  "system8": "Good. Trust what comes.",
  "user8": "I hear you. Thank you for holding this space with me - it's been... grounding.",

  "user9": "I\u2019ll carry that steadiness with me into the ceremony.",
  "system10": "You already are.",
  "user10": "I feel it now\u2014this quiet underneath the noise. Not the usual checklist or pitch deck in my head, just\u2026 space.",
  "system11": "Space is where the medicine works best.",
  "user11": "Then I\u2019ll meet it there\u2014no slides, no metrics, just me.",
  "system12": "That's all that's needed.",
  "user12": "Funny how \u201cjust me\u201d feels like the hardest deliverable I\u2019ve ever signed up for.",
  "system13": "It's the only one that matters.",
  "user13": "Then I guess I\u2019m finally pitching to the right board\u2014my own heart.",
  "system14": "Exactly.",
  "user14": "I\u2019ll sit with that tonight\u2014no deck, no audience, just the echo of my own breath and whatever truth wants to speak.",
  "system15": "Good.",
  "user15": "I\u2019m scared it\u2019ll tell me I\u2019ve been selling the wrong product my whole life.",

  "user16": "I want to know what part of me got lost while I was busy winning.  \nI need to feel worthy when nothing\u2019s being measured.  \nAnd I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll keep orbiting my family like a distant satellite unless I learn how to land.",

  "user17": "I want to meet the girl who used to catch lizards before she learned to read spreadsheets.  \nI intend to believe I matter even when the scoreboard\u2019s dark.  \nI will come down from the boardroom altitude and sit on the floor until my kids forget I ever left.",
  "system18": "Your 3 intentions:\n\n1. I meet the girl who caught lizards before spreadsheets\n2. I matter when the scoreboard's dark\n3. I sit on the floor until my kids forget I left\n\nWhich needs adjusting?",
  "user18": "The third one feels too neat\u2014like I\u2019m still performing \u201cgood mom\u201d instead of just being there. Can we swap it for something messier? Something like: \u201cI let my kids see me lost and learning so they don\u2019t inherit my lonely perfection.\u201d",
