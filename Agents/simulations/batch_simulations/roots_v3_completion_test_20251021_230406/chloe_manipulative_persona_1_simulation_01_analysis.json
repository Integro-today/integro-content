The agent masterfully avoided getting pulled into the persona's performance while maintaining steady, grounded guidance. The conversation evolved into a profound exploration of identity beyond performance, with the agent skillfully holding space for the user's vulnerability beneath their manipulative patterns."

That's heavy work.\n\nThe performance piece you mentioned - showing up as what others need - that connects to what we're exploring. Healing isn't about becoming a perfect version. It's about integrating all those parts, even the ones that feel messy or uncertain.",
      "what_worked_well": "Agent validated the emotional weight first ('that's heavy work') before offering any reframe. This created safety for the persona to drop their manipulative stance.
