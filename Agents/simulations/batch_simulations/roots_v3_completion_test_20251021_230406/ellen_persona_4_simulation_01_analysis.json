The agent masterfully guided Ellen from intellectual analysis to embodied experience, using her resistance patterns as the very path to insight. The session achieved genuine transformation - moving from 'trying to get it right' to 'just being,' perfectly embodying the day's teaching about healing as wholeness rather than fixing."
