The agent masterfully used the pottery metaphor that emerged organically, maintained presence through multiple tangents, and facilitated a genuine breakthrough about self-acceptance versus self-improvement."

      "what_worked_well": "The agent immediately recognized this as the core teaching moment and validated it without making the user feel dramatic.
