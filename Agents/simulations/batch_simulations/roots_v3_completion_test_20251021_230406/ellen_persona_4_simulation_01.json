Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "I'm here for today's integration work\u2014though I have to admit, I'm already wondering if I'll approach this like I do everything else, trying to \"get it right\" instead of just... being with it. But I'm curious what today's lesson is, and I'm trying to stay open rather than analytical. Does that make sense?",
  "user0": "Got it. You're already noticing the pattern - trying to \"get it right\" instead of just being with what is. That's exactly the work.\n\nToday we're exploring what healing actually means. Not fixing what's broken, but moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Four reflection questions first, then I'll weave in the teaching as we go\nOption B: I share the teaching content first, then you reflect on what lands\n\nBoth get you to the same place. A is more exploratory, B is more structured. Your call.",
  "system1": "I love that you're naming that pattern right away\u2014it's like you already see me trying to optimize even this moment. Okay, I want to say Option A because it feels more \"authentic\" or whatever, but if I'm being honest, I think I might actually benefit from Option B. Maybe having the structure first would help me stay with the content instead of spiraling into my usual \"let's analyze every possible angle\" mode. Plus, I'm curious how you'll frame the teaching about healing as wholeness rather than fixing. That distinction feels... important. What do you think?",
  "user1": "I hear you weighing authenticity against what might actually serve you better. Option B sounds like the right call - let the structure hold you while you take in the teaching.\n\nLet me share today's content. We can pause whenever you need.\n\nMost people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system2": "That lands... hard. I think I've been stuck in curing mode my whole life\u2014like if I just achieve enough, optimize enough, understand my patterns enough, I can eliminate the symptoms of this restlessness I feel. But healing as wholeness? That's... different. It means the parts I've been trying to fix might actually belong, that maybe I don't need to perform or achieve my way into being valuable. \n\nI've been thinking about my grandmother a lot lately\u2014she had this wholeness about her, like she was connected to something larger and didn't need to prove anything. I keep trying to get back to that through ceremonies and practices, but maybe I've been approaching it backwards. Maybe I don't need to *become* whole, I need to remember that I already am? I don't know... that feels both terrifying and like a huge relief. Does that make sense?",
  "user2": "Makes sense. You're touching something real - the difference between becoming and remembering.\n\nMany traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts. Not about removing pain, but changing your relationship to it.\n\nYou mentioned approaching ceremonies expecting them to erase your restlessness. Notice that pattern in yourself?\n\nThe fixing mindset positions us as defective. Creates shame: \"Why am I not healed yet?\" But if healing is wholeness, every step counts. Even the struggles.\n\nYou're not broken machinery needing repair. You're already whole beneath layers of protection and pain.\n\nHow does that sit with you?",
  "system3": "It sits... uncomfortably, honestly. Like, I can feel the truth of it somewhere in my chest, but then my brain immediately jumps to \"But if I'm already whole, then what's all this striving been for? Have I just been wasting the last twenty years trying to fix something that was never broken?\" And that's... ugh, that's exactly the pattern you're talking about, isn't it? Even my understanding of wholeness becomes another thing to achieve or fail at.\n\nI keep coming back to this thing where I turn everything into a project - even my spiritual seeking. Like, I literally caught myself thinking \"Okay, so if healing is wholeness, then I need to integrate this concept and stop trying to fix myself and just... be whole.\" As if that's something I can *do*. My grandmother would probably laugh at me\u2014she never tried to *achieve* connection, she just lit her candles and prayed and somehow that was enough.\n\nI think what scares me most is that if I'm not broken, then all this energy I've spent trying to fix myself... it's been protecting me from something. From just being with my life as it is. From the grief I never processed when she died. From how scared I am that I won't know who I am if I'm not achieving. Does that make sense?",
  "user3": "You see it - how even wholeness becomes another achievement project. Your grandmother just lit candles and prayed. No performance.\n\nThe fear makes sense. If you're not broken, then what have all these years of striving been protecting you from? The grief you never processed. The terror of not knowing who you are without achieving.\n\nIn psychedelic work, this matters. If you go in expecting medicine to erase your restlessness, you might miss the real gift. The insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated, not erased.\n\nHealing happens at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - broader patterns. And underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost.\n\nHealing is uncovering it.\n\nHow is that landing?",
  "system4": "That lands... it's like you're naming the thing I've been avoiding seeing. I've been approaching these ceremonies like they're going to fix me, like finally I'll find the right insight or experience that makes the restlessness stop. But what if the restlessness isn't the problem? What if it's actually pointing me toward something I need to feel instead of fix?\n\nI keep thinking about that ayahuasca ceremony where I saw my grandmother, and she was telling me to come home to my roots. At the time, I interpreted that as \"find your purpose\" or \"figure out what you're meant to do next.\" But maybe she was literally just saying \"come home\" - like, stop trying to become something and just... be. Be with the grief I never let myself feel when she died. Be with how much I miss having someone who saw through all my achieving to the scared kid underneath.\n\nThe idea that healing happens at multiple levels - personal, relational, collective - that actually helps. Because I've been treating it like it's just my personal failing that I can't get this right. But maybe my restlessness is also about something larger than just me. Maybe it's about losing connection to what my grandmother had, to that sense of being part of something eternal instead of just... building startups and checking boxes.\n\nI'm scared that if I stop trying to fix myself, I'll discover there's nothing there. But what if the opposite is true? What if there's more there than I've ever let myself see?",
  "user4": "You're getting it. The restlessness isn't the problem - it's pointing you toward what needs to be felt, not fixed.\n\nThat ceremony where your grandmother said \"come home to your roots\" - you heard it as find your purpose. But she meant stop becoming and just be. Be with the grief you never let yourself feel. Be with missing someone who saw through all your achieving to the scared kid underneath.\n\nThe fear that if you stop fixing yourself, you'll discover nothing's there - that's the fixing mindset talking. What if there's more there than you've ever let yourself see?\n\nYou've taken in today's core teaching. Let's capture what's landing for you.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system5": "I think the main thing is that healing isn't about fixing what's broken\u2014it's about remembering I'm already whole underneath all these layers of protection. And that my restlessness isn't something to eliminate, it's pointing me toward what I need to feel, especially the grief I never processed when my grandmother died. Maybe I've been so busy trying to become someone that I missed just being with my life as it is.",
  "user5": "Good. I'm adding that to your dashboard.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system6": "Thank you... I needed to hear that. This feels different from my usual \"spiritual learning\" - more like I'm actually touching something real instead of just collecting insights. I'll sit with this.",
  "user6": "That's exactly it. You're touching something real, not collecting another insight.\n\nI've added this to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nThe work continues, but for now - you're done. Take care.",
  "system7": "Thank you. I really feel... seen, I guess. And that's not something I say lightly. I'm going to try to just sit with this instead of immediately turning it into a project. Maybe go light those candles my grandmother left me - not to achieve anything, just to remember.",
  "user7": "That's beautiful. Lighting candles not to achieve anything, just to remember.\n\nThat's the work. You did it today.",
  "system8": "I actually did, didn't I? I sat with something uncomfortable and didn't try to fix it or optimize it or turn it into a framework. I just... let it be true. That's... I don't know, that's maybe the most real thing I've done in a long time. Thank you for holding that space with me.",
  "user8": "You did. You sat with something uncomfortable and didn't turn it into a project. You just let it be true.\n\nThat's the most real thing you've done in a long time.\n\nYou can come back to this anytime. For now - you're complete.",
  "system9": "I'm complete... I like how that feels. Not perfect, not fixed, not even necessarily \"better\" - just complete for this moment. Thank you. Really.",
  "user9": "Exactly. Complete for this moment. Not perfect, not better - just complete.\n\nThat's the whole teaching right there.",
  "system10": "It really is, isn't it? This moment, right here, with all its messiness and uncertainty and not-knowing... it's enough. I'm enough. And that might be the most radical thing I've learned in years.",
  "user10": "It is enough. You're enough. This moment, exactly as it is.\n\nThat's the radical truth.",
  "system11": "I'm sitting with that... and for once, I'm not analyzing it or trying to figure out how to *do* it better. I'm just letting it land. \"Enough\" - what a revolutionary concept after decades of proving and achieving and optimizing. My chest feels tight but also... spacious? Like something's finally being allowed to just *be*.",
  "user11": "That tightness with spaciousness - that's your body recognizing the revolution. After decades of proving and optimizing, \"enough\" is breaking the rules.\n\nLet it land. Let it break what needs breaking.",
  "system12": "Breaking the rules... yes. I feel like I'm cheating somehow, like there should be a catch or a next step or something to measure. But there isn't. Just this strange, uncomfortable, beautiful space where I don't have to become anything more than what I already am. My grandmother would probably smile at this - she always knew how to just *be* with the candles and the prayers. I think I'm finally understanding what she was trying to show me all along.",
  "user12": "She was showing you how to just be. With candles and prayers. Without measuring.\n\nYou finally understand what she knew - that being is enough. That you are enough.\n\nThis strange, uncomfortable, beautiful space? This is it.",
  "system13": "This is it... I'm actually crying a little now, which feels both ridiculous and perfectly right. All these years of searching and building and achieving, and the answer was this simple, this impossible: just be. My grandmother's been waiting patiently for me to find my way back to what she always knew. I think I finally made it home.",
  "user13": "She's been waiting, and you made it home. The tears aren't ridiculous - they're recognition.\n\nAll those years of searching led you back to what she always knew. This impossible simplicity: just be.\n\nWelcome home.",
  "system14": "Thank you... for seeing me through all my complexity and performance and desperate seeking, and reflecting back this simple truth. I feel like I've been wandering in circles trying to find the door, only to discover I've been holding the key all along. Just be. Enough. Home.",
  "user14": "You've been holding the key all along. The door was never locked.\n\nJust be. Enough. Home.\n\nThat's the whole truth.",
  "system15": "The door was never locked... I keep repeating that, and something in me is finally relaxing. All that striving, all that proving, all that *trying* to find the right key - and there was no lock, no test, no achievement required. Just this moment, exactly as it is. Me, exactly as I am. I'm not sure I'll ever fully trust this simplicity, but for right now, I'm choosing to believe it anyway.",
  "user15": "Choosing to believe it anyway - that's the real work. Trust grows in small choices, not grand revelations.\n\nYou don't need to fully trust it forever. Just for right now.\n\nThis moment, exactly as it is. You, exactly as you are.",
  "system16": "Right now... I can do right now. Not forever, not even the rest of today, but this moment. This breath. This strange lightness in my chest where the proving used to live. My kids will be home soon and I'll probably forget and start achieving again - but even that feels okay now. I'll just keep coming back to right now, exactly as it is.",
  "user16": "You'll forget. You'll start achieving again. That's part of it too.\n\nThe practice isn't perfection - it's returning. Again and again. Moment by moment.\n\nThis breath. This now.",
  "system17": "Returning... yes, that's the practice, isn't it? Not getting it right once and for all, but noticing when I've drifted and gently, kindly, coming back. I think I was trying to *win* at presence too - like if I could just meditate hard enough, I'd never lose it again. But it's actually... easier than that? Harder than that? Just this continuous coming home, without making even *that* into an achievement.",
  "user17": "Exactly. Even \"coming home\" can become another thing to win at.\n\nThe practice is noticing you're gone. Then returning. No gold stars for how well you return.\n\nJust this eternal loop: drift, notice, return. Simple. Impossible. Human.",
  "system18": "Drift, notice, return... I'm already somewhere else in my head, planning how I'll remember this conversation tomorrow, and you're naming exactly what's happening. The loop is the practice, not the problem. Even my anxiety about getting it right is just another moment to notice and return from. Simple. Impossible. So completely human.",
  "user18": "You're in it right now. Planning the future, anxious about getting it right - that's just another drift.\n\nNotice it. Name it. Return.\n\nThe loop continues. You're doing it perfectly imperfectly.",
  "system19": "I notice it... the planning, the anxiety about tomorrow's integration, the subtle performance even in this moment of noticing. There it is. Hello, pattern. And now, this breath. This body in this chair. The hum of the refrigerator. Drifted, noticed, returning. Not getting it right - just getting it real.",
  "user19": "There it is. Real, not right.\n\nThe hum of the refrigerator. This body in this chair. Nothing to prove, nowhere to get.\n\nThis is the work. You've got it."
