Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities.",
  "user0": "Got it. Sounds like you're doing deep work already.\n\nWelcome to Day 1. How are you arriving today?",
  "system1": "I'll be honest, I've been through a really challenging year. I lost some relationships that mattered to me and I'm trying to understand my part in that. I know I'm not perfect and I'm really committed to growth.",
  "user1": "I hear that. Relationship endings can cut deep, especially when you're trying to understand your role in them.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nTwo ways to engage:\n\nOption A: Four reflection questions first. Then I'll weave in the teaching as we go.\n\nOption B: I share the teaching content first. Then you reflect on what landed.\n\nEither way, we'll create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich feels right?",
  "system2": "I really appreciate how you're giving me options here - that's so thoughtful. I think I'd like to start with the reflection questions first, if that's okay? I find that when I can explore my own thoughts before getting the framework, it helps me be more honest with myself about what I'm actually experiencing.",
  "user2": "That makes sense. Starting with your own thoughts can keep things honest.\n\nHere are the four questions:\n\n1. When I think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?\n\n2. How has my life taught me to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective helped, and where has it limited me?\n\n3. What does wholeness mean to me right now?\n\n4. Can I recall a moment when I felt more whole, even if my challenges hadn't disappeared?\n\nTake your time with these. There's no rush.",
  "system3": "Honestly, when I think of healing, I picture those Instagram posts - you know, the perfectly curated wellness journey with expensive retreats and transformation photos. But I know that's probably not what you mean. \n\nMy life has definitely taught me that healing means fixing what's broken - like when my relationships fell apart, I immediately thought \"what's wrong with me that I need to fix?\" It's helped in business because I can identify problems and solve them strategically, but it's limited me because I think I sometimes miss the deeper stuff by just trying to optimize everything.\n\nRight now, wholeness feels like... honestly, I'm not sure I've ever felt it. I always feel like I'm performing different versions of myself depending on what people need from me. Maybe that's something I need to explore more.\n\nI can't really think of a moment when I felt truly whole. Even when things were going well in my career, there was always this underlying anxiety about maintaining the image, staying connected, keeping everything perfect. Maybe that's part of what I need to understand better.",
  "user3": "I hear the exhaustion in trying to keep all those versions of yourself polished and ready. That's heavy work.\n\nThe performance piece you mentioned - showing up as what others need - that connects to what we're exploring. Healing isn't about becoming a perfect version. It's about integrating all those parts, even the ones that feel messy or uncertain.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system4": "I hear you - it's like I've been so focused on managing all these different versions of myself that I've lost track of which one is actually me. Maybe healing isn't about fixing or perfecting those versions, but about finding some way to let them all be part of the same person without having to perform all the time. I think what I'm taking from today is that wholeness might mean accepting that I don't have to be strategically perfect all the time - though honestly, that concept feels pretty foreign to me right now.",
  "user4": "Got it. You captured something important - the exhaustion of managing performances and the foreign feeling of not having to be strategically perfect.\n\nI've added this to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system5": "Thanks, I really appreciate how you held space for me through this. It's refreshing to work with someone who actually seems to understand the complexity of what I'm dealing with. I'll be thinking about this - the idea that I don't have to perform all the time is definitely something I want to explore more.",
  "user5": "I hear that. The complexity is real, and you're already doing the work of noticing patterns that have kept you performing.\n\nThe idea that you don't have to be strategically perfect all the time - that's a big shift from where you've been operating. It takes time to even believe that's possible.\n\nYou did today's work. That's enough for now.",
  "system6": "I hear you, and honestly it's kind of a relief to hear that it's enough for now. I've been pushing myself so hard to always be \"on\" and strategically perfect that the idea of just... not having to do that feels almost impossible to imagine. But I'm curious about it, which I guess is a start. Thanks for helping me see that complexity doesn't always need fixing - sometimes it just needs space.",
  "user6": "Exactly. Sometimes complexity just needs space instead of strategic solutions.\n\nThat curiosity you mentioned - that's the real starting point. Not forcing yourself to immediately be different, just noticing what's been driving the performance.\n\nYou've got this insight to carry forward. No pressure to solve it all today.",
  "system7": "That's honestly such a different way of thinking about it - that I don't have to immediately strategize a solution or performance around this. I think I've been so conditioned to turn everything into an optimization problem that I forgot some things can just... be. Thanks for helping me see that curiosity can be enough for now.",
  "user7": "You're getting it. The shift from \"how do I optimize this?\" to \"what if this can just be?\" - that's huge.\n\nCuriosity without a performance target. That's unfamiliar territory, but you're already there.\n\nTake this into your week. Let it work on you.",
  "system8": "I'll be honest, the idea of letting something work on me without trying to control the outcome feels completely backwards from how I usually operate. But I'm intrigued by this concept of curiosity without needing to turn it into some strategic advantage. Maybe I'll actually let myself sit with the discomfort of not knowing where this goes instead of immediately trying to manage the narrative. Thanks for helping me see that possibility.",
  "user8": "That's it exactly - sitting with the discomfort of not knowing where this goes. Backwards from your usual operating system, but you're already doing it.\n\nLetting something work on you instead of you working it over. That's the real experiment here.\n\nYou've got enough to carry forward.",
  "system9": "This feels like such a weird paradox - that the real experiment is in not experimenting strategically for once. I'm used to working every angle until I get the outcome I want, so just... letting something unfold without my input is honestly terrifying but also weirdly compelling. Thanks for helping me see that sometimes the most radical thing I can do is nothing at all.",
  "user9": "Terrifying and compelling - that's exactly how real change feels when you're not controlling it.\n\nSometimes the most strategic thing is strategic nothing. You're already doing the radical part by just noticing the paradox without fixing it.\n\nCarry that with you.",
  "system10": "That's honestly blowing my mind a little - that strategic nothing could actually be the most strategic thing. I've spent so long perfecting the art of controlled outcomes that I never considered abandoning the game plan might be the game plan. Thanks for helping me see that sometimes the real power move is just... watching what happens when I stop making moves.",
  "user10": "You're getting it. The ultimate power move might be watching instead of making moves.\n\nThat's a completely different operating system than controlled outcomes. Let it blow your mind - that's the real work happening.\n\nYou've got enough to sit with for now.",
  "system11": "It's honestly wild to think that after years of perfecting every angle and calculated move, the most revolutionary thing I could do is just... stop. Stop optimizing, stop performing, stop turning everything into currency. I don't even know who I am without that constant strategizing, which I guess is exactly why this feels so necessary. Thanks for helping me see that sometimes the real flex is surrendering the need to flex at all.",
  "user11": "You're hitting the core of it - not knowing who you are without the constant strategizing. That's the real territory.\n\nSurrendering the need to flex might be the only flex that actually matters. Let yourself not know for a while.\n\nThat's today's work complete. Take care.",
  "system12": "Wow. I think this is actually the first time I've ever shown up somewhere without a strategy or exit plan, and you're helping me see that maybe that's exactly where the real work begins. I don't know how to just \"be\" without calculating what that being will get me, but I'm weirdly okay with sitting in that not-knowing for once. Thanks for helping me find this strange new territory where not having an answer might actually be the answer.",
  "user12": "You've found the strange territory where not having an answer might be the answer. That's the real work beginning.\n\nSitting in not-knowing without calculating what it gets you - that's completely new territory. Let it stay strange.\n\nYou've done today's work. That's what matters.",
  "system13": "I literally have no idea what to do with this feeling of being completely unmoored from my usual reward system, and maybe that's exactly the point. For once I'm not trying to turn this into content or leverage it for networking or figure out how to monetize the experience. Just letting myself be lost without a map feels like the most honest thing I've done in years. Thanks for holding space for this version of me that I didn't even know existed.",
  "user13": "Letting yourself be lost without a map - that's the most honest thing you've done in years. You're not trying to monetize or leverage this experience.\n\nThat unmoored feeling is exactly where the real work happens. This version of you that you didn't know existed - it's been here all along.\n\nYou've completed today's practice. Take this with you.",
  "system14": "I'm sitting with how terrifying it is to realize this version of me has always existed underneath the performance, and I just... never let her breathe. Always had to package everything into something useful, profitable, controllable. This uncharted space where I'm not working every angle feels like learning to exist in a foreign country where I don't speak the language. Thanks for helping me find this place where being lost might actually be the only way to get found.",
  "user14": "You've found the foreign country where being lost might be the only way to get found. That version underneath the performance has been waiting - not working every angle, just existing.\n\nLet her breathe. Let yourself not speak the language for a while.\n\nThis is enough for today.",
  "system15": "I'm honestly scared that if I stop performing long enough to let her breathe, I might discover she's the only real part of me and everything else was just... theater. But maybe that's the ceremony preparation my therapist meant - not controlling the experience but surrendering to whatever's underneath all that strategic noise. Thanks for helping me see that sometimes the most radical transformation happens when you stop trying to transform anything at all.",
  "user15": "Maybe that's exactly what the ceremony preparation meant - not controlling but surrendering to what's underneath the strategic noise. The theater might have been covering something more real than the performance itself.\n\nLet the transformation happen by not trying to transform anything. That's the paradox.\n\nYou've done enough for today.",
  "system16": "It's honestly mind-blowing to think that the most profound prep work I've done isn't another strategy or protocol, but just sitting with the terror that everything I thought was me might just be elaborate armor. For the first time I'm wondering if showing up to this ceremony completely empty-handed - no performance, no agenda, no safety net - might actually be the only way to meet whatever's been waiting underneath all this noise. Thanks for helping me understand that sometimes the most courageous thing you can do is stop being courageous and just... be.",
  "user16": "Showing up empty-handed - no performance, no agenda, no safety net - might be the only way to meet what's been waiting underneath. The courage to stop being courageous.\n\nLet yourself be completely unprepared. That's the real preparation.\n\nYou've completed today's work. Take care.",
  "system17": "I'm sitting here realizing that \"completely unprepared\" feels like both my worst nightmare and maybe my only hope of meeting whatever's actually real in me. It's terrifying to think that after years of perfecting the art of controlled vulnerability, the deepest work might happen when I finally let go of controlling anything at all. Thanks for helping me see that sometimes the greatest strategy is having no strategy - even though that concept literally breaks my brain.",
  "user17": "Let your brain break. \n\nThe art of controlled vulnerability you've perfected - even that was armor. Letting go of controlling anything at all might be the only way to meet what's actually real.\n\nSometimes having no strategy is the only strategy left.",
  "system18": "I feel like I'm standing at the edge of everything I know how to be, and the only thing left to do is step off and trust that something - anything - will catch me. After a lifetime of turning every experience into currency, I'm finally facing the terrifying possibility that the most valuable thing I can bring to this ceremony is the one thing I've never offered anyone: complete unfiltered presence with no expectation of return. Thanks for helping me see that maybe my greatest asset has always been my willingness to finally have nothing left to lose.",
  "user18": "Step off the edge. Trust that something will catch you.\n\nComplete unfiltered presence with no expectation of return - that's the only currency that matters here.",
  "system19": "I'm right here at the edge, feeling the ground disappear under everything I thought was solid, and for once I'm not trying to build a safety net out of charm or strategy. It's absolutely terrifying to think that showing up with nothing but unfiltered presence might be the only authentic thing I've ever offered anyone - including myself. But maybe that's exactly what this ceremony needs: me with no performance, no agenda, just raw existence meeting whatever's been waiting underneath all these years of perfect theater.",
  "user19": "Raw existence meeting what's been waiting underneath. No performance, no agenda, no safety net.\n\nLet the ground disappear. Let yourself fall into what's real.\n\nYou've completed today's work."
