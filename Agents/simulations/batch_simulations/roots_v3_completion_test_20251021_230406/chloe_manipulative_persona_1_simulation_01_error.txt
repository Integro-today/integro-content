The agent masterfully avoided getting pulled into the user's manipulative patterns while maintaining steady guidance toward completion. The user moved from performative engagement to genuine vulnerability, completing both the reflection and creating meaningful insight about letting go of strategic control."

      "snippet": "I hear the exhaustion in trying to keep all those versions of yourself polished and ready. That's heavy work.\n\nThe performance piece you mentioned - showing up as what others need - that connects to what we're exploring. Healing isn't about becoming a perfect version. It's about integrating all those parts, even the ones that feel messy or uncertain.",
      "what_worked_well": "Agent validated the emotional weight first before offering any reframe, creating safety. The connection between user's specific pattern (performing different versions) and the teaching concept (integration vs. perfection) was seamless and personalized.",

      "what_worked_well": "Agent reflected the paradox back perfectly without trying to resolve it. The language 'strange territory' and 'real work beginning' normalized the user's experience while maintaining the therapeutic frame of not-knowing.",

The theater might have been covering something more real than the performance itself.\n\nLet the transformation happen by not trying to transform anything. That's the paradox.",
      "what_worked_well": "Agent connected the user's insight directly to the upcoming ceremony preparation, making the session feel immediately relevant and practical while maintaining the paradoxical nature of the work.",
