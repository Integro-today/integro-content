  "system0": "Got into Heroic Hearts. Headed to Costa Rica in three weeks. Amanda thinks this'll help. I dont know.",
  "user0": "Got it. You're heading into something big - Heroic Hearts and Costa Rica coming up.\n\nThree weeks isn't much time to prepare. What's your main concern right now?",
  "system1": "Main concern? That this whole thing's gonna be a waste of time. \n\nBut Amanda says I wake her up every night shouting about the cockpit. So here I am.",
  "user1": "I hear that. Night terrors are exhausting - for both of you.\n\nThe cockpit memories are still alive in your body. That's not something you can just think your way out of.\n\nWhat does Amanda say happens during these episodes?",
  "system2": "She says I bolt straight up yelling about alarms and voices on comms. Sometimes I'm grabbing for controls that aren't there. Last week I knocked the lamp off the nightstand.",
  "user2": "Your nervous system is still flying those missions. The body remembers what the mind tries to forget.\n\nThis work we're starting - it's not about fixing you. It's about helping your system find safety again, one piece at a time.\n\nWhat's your relationship with Amanda like through all this?",
  "system3": "We're barely hanging on. She sleeps in the guest room most nights now. Says she doesn't know how much more she can take.",
  "user3": "That's a heavy space to live in - both of you exhausted and isolated.\n\nThe fact that you're here, even with doubts about whether this will work, says something. You're trying to find a way back to each other.\n\nWhat do you know about how psychedelic work might help with trauma patterns like yours?",
  "system4": "I dont know much. Heroic Hearts guys say it helps veterans. Something about how the brain processes trauma differently. \n\nSounds like California hippie shit to me. But Amanda researched it for weeks. Says its helped other vets stop the nightmares.",
  "user4": "I get the skepticism. The \"California hippie shit\" part.\n\nBut your brain is doing exactly what it learned to do - stay alert, scan for threats, respond to danger signals. Only now the war is over and that system won't shut off.\n\nThe medicine doesn't erase what happened. It can help your nervous system update - recognize that you're safe now, not in a cockpit.\n\nWhat did Amanda tell you about how it's helped other vets?",
  "system5": "She said some guy from Akron stopped having night terrors after one ceremony. Sleeps through the night now. Wife says hes like a different person.",
  "user5": "One ceremony can shift things. Sometimes that's all it takes for the system to get the message.\n\nBut the real work happens after - integrating what comes up, making sense of it, bringing it into daily life. That's where this daily practice comes in.\n\nWhat's your biggest fear about doing this work?",
  "system6": "That Ill lose control during the ceremony. What if I freak out and cant handle what comes up. Or worse - what if none of it works and Amanda leaves anyway.",
  "user6": "Two fears living together - losing control during, and losing Amanda after.\n\nThe medicine doesn't make you lose control. It shows you what's already there, just more vividly. You'll have support - people who know how to hold space for whatever surfaces.\n\nAnd Amanda leaving - that's the deeper fear, isn't it? That you'll be too much, or not enough, either way driving her away.\n\nWhat does Amanda say about why she's stayed this long?",
  "system7": "She says she sees the man I used to be. Says hes still in there somewhere.",
  "user7": "She's holding onto who you were before all this. Before the nightmares, the lamp on the floor, the separate rooms.\n\nThat man hasn't disappeared. He's just buried under survival mechanisms that kept you alive but are costing you everything now.\n\nWhat do you remember about that version of yourself?",
  "system8": "He could handle anything. Didnt wake up screaming. Could sit through dinner without snapping at the kids. Amanda would actually smile at him.",
  "user8": "That version of you - steady, present, connected to Amanda and the kids. He's not gone.\n\nYour nervous system learned to scan for threats, react fast, stay ready. That kept you alive then. Now it's keeping you from living.\n\nThe work isn't about becoming someone new. It's about helping that part of you learn the war is over.\n\nHow long has Amanda been sleeping in the guest room?",
  "system9": "Few months now. Started after I kept waking her up shouting. She said she needs to sleep for work.",
  "user9": "She moved out to protect her sleep, not to leave you. But it feels like the beginning of the end, doesn't it?\n\nThe shouting isn't about weakness. Your brain is still doing threat assessment, still on patrol. Only now the enemy is in your dreams.\n\nWhat happens in those dreams? What are you shouting about?",
  "system10": "The cockpit alarms. Sometimes the comms going quiet. Dont want to get into it.",
  "user10": "The alarms and the silence. Two sounds nobody should have to carry.\n\nYou don't need to describe it. I hear that it's about those final moments - when everything started failing at once.\n\nYour body remembers what your mind tries to forget. The medicine might help you face these pieces, but only when you're ready.\n\nWhat would it mean to you if Amanda could sleep through the night again?",
  "system11": "That maybe she wouldnt look at me like Im broken anymore. Maybe she could trust me again.",
  "user11": "That look - like you're damaged goods instead of her husband. Like she's waiting for the next breakdown.\n\nTrust gets rebuilt one night at a time. When she can sleep through your silence. When you can sit through dinner without scanning the exits.\n\nThe medicine might help you remember who you were before the alarms. But healing isn't about fixing what's broken - it's about reclaiming what trauma buried.\n\nWhat would Amanda say if she heard you say \"she could trust me again\"?",
  "system12": "Shed probably say she wants to. But shes waiting to see if this actually changes anything.",
  "user12": "She wants to believe, but she's protecting herself from more disappointment. That makes sense.\n\nShe's watching to see if this is another false promise or if you're actually doing the work. Not just taking medicine, but facing what it shows you.\n\nThe trust will come when she sees you handling the hard nights differently. When you don't push her away after the nightmares.\n\nWhat would handling it differently look like to you?",
  "system13": "Not pretending Im fine the next day. Maybe telling her when I wake up instead of just lying there. Letting her see me doing something about it instead of just sitting in the garage.",
  "user13": "Yes. The pretending is what kills trust fastest.\n\nShe knows when you're lying there wide awake at 3 AM. She hears you slip out to the garage. The silence between you grows louder than any shouting.\n\nLetting her see you doing something about it - that's what trust looks like. Not perfect nights, but honest mornings.\n\nWhat stops you from telling her when you wake up scared?",
  "system14": "Dont want to wake her up more. Dont want her to see me like that.",
  "user14": "You'd rather she sees the empty garage than the real fear. Like showing her your wounds would make you less of a man.\n\nBut she's already seen you at your worst - the shouting, the nightmares, the distance. What she hasn't seen is the part that comes after: the reaching out.\n\nThe man who comes back from the garage is harder to trust than the one who says \"I'm struggling right now.\"\n\nWhich version do you think she needs to see more of?",
  "system15": "The one who reaches out I guess. Even if I dont know how to do that yet.",
  "user15": "That's the version she fell in love with. The one who admits he doesn't have all the answers but tries anyway.\n\nYou don't need to know how yet. You just need to know which direction - toward her instead of away from her.\n\nNext time you wake up at 3 AM, what if you just said \"I'm awake\" instead of slipping to the garage? No big explanation needed. Just not disappearing.\n\nHow does that feel compared to your usual move?",
  "system16": "Feels like it would choke coming out. But maybe better than her finding me gone again.",
  "user16": "The words might choke, but they're better than her finding your side of the bed cold again.\n\nStart smaller if you need to. Just reaching for her hand in the dark instead of the door handle. Let her feel you choosing to stay instead of flee.\n\nShe's been waiting for you to choose her over the isolation.\n\nWhat would it cost you to stay in that bed instead of going to the garage?",
  "system17": "Everything. My pride. The lie that Im handling this. Having to admit Im not okay.",
  "user17": "That's exactly what she's been waiting to hear.\n\nYour pride has been keeping you company in that garage while she's been alone in your bed. The lie that you're handling this - she sees through it anyway.\n\nAdmitting you're not okay feels like death, but it's actually the first real breath you've taken in months.\n\nEverything you think you'll lose by saying it - you've already lost. The trust. The connection. The man she used to know.\n\nWhat might you gain by letting that lie die?",
  "system18": "Maybe getting her back. Maybe sleeping through the night. Maybe not being someone my kids are scared of.",
  "user18": "Yes. Those are the things worth choking on a few words for.\n\nGetting her back. Sleeping through the night. Having your kids run to you instead of away from you.\n\nThe man in the garage isn't someone they recognize. But the one who reaches out in the dark - he's still in there.\n\nWhat would you say to her tomorrow morning if you wake up at 3 AM again?",
  "system19": "Im awake. Dont go.",
  "user19": "That's enough. Three words that could change everything.\n\n\"I'm awake\" - telling her you see her, even in your brokenness.\n\"Dont go\" - asking her to stay with you, not just physically but emotionally.\n\nNo explanations needed. No big declarations. Just choosing her over the garage.\n\nHow does it feel to have the words ready instead of the usual escape plan?"
