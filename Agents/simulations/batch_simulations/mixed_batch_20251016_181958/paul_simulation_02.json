  "seed_message": "You're starting intention-setting work with someone.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions.\n\nWhat brought you to this work?",

  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Let's set intentions for your journey.\n\nIntentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.\n\nI'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.\n\nWhat are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.",
  "user0": "Look, I don't really know how to do this. Heroic Hearts says I should set these intentions, but I've never done anything like this before. \n\nI guess... I need to figure out how to sleep through the night without waking up Amanda. She's tired of it, and honestly, so am I. Three weeks till I head to Costa Rica, and I just want this plant stuff to fix whatever's broken in my head.\n\nI don't want to lose her. That's all I know for sure right now.",
  "system1": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without disturbing Amanda\n2. Heal what's broken in your head \n3. Keep your relationship strong\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user1": "Yeah, those are the things keeping me up at night. Literally. \n\nBut I'm not sure about saying anything's \"broken.\" That's not how I see it. I did what I had to do over there, and I'd do it again. I just need... I don't know what I need. The dreams to stop, maybe. To be the guy Amanda married instead of whatever I've become.\n\nI want to be strong without being angry all the time. That's what I'll say. Strong like I used to be, before everything got twisted up in my head.",
  "system2": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I reclaim the strength Amanda first loved in me\n3. I channel my strength without anger\n\nWhich speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?",
  "user2": "The first one - \"I sleep peacefully through the night.\" That's what I want more than anything. If I could just shut my eyes and wake up when it's morning, not when I'm back in the cockpit or hearing explosions that aren't there...\n\nBut I don't know about \"reclaiming\" anything. Makes it sound like I'm lost or something. I'm still me. I just need to figure out how to turn off the parts that keep bleeding into my life here.\n\nMaybe \"I protect my family with presence instead of anger.\" That's closer to what I mean. Protection's what I know how to do.",
  "system3": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: I sleep peacefully through the night\n\n\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I protect my family with presence instead of anger\n\nHow about intention 3 - what feels right for turning off the bleed-over?",
  "user3": "\"I release the mission so I can be home.\"\n\nThat's what I need. Over there, I had to stay sharp, had to be ready for anything. But I'm not there anymore. I'm in Toledo, selling insurance, raising kids. I need to let go of that readiness that's eating me up inside.\n\nI don't know if some plant medicine can actually do that, but that's what I want. To stop feeling like I need to be ready for the next threat that isn't coming.",
  "system4": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I sleep peacefully through the night\n2. I protect my family with presence instead of anger  \n3. I release the mission so I can be home\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user4": "Alright. These feel... solid. Like something I can actually hold onto when things get rough. \n\nI appreciate you walking through this with me. I still don't know if this plant stuff will work, but at least now I know what I'm asking it to do. Three weeks and I'll find out.\n\nThanks for your help.",
  "system5": "You've got a good compass. The medicine will work with what you've set.\n\nThree weeks will come quick. Trust what comes.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Three weeks. \n\nI've waited longer for deployments. I can wait for this.",
  "system6": "Exactly. You've got this.",
  "user6": "Appreciate that.",
  "system7": "Solid work today.",
  "user7": "Thanks. Means something, coming from someone who knows this terrain.",

  "user15": "I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this might help me sleep without\u2026 whatever it is that happens at night. Amanda\u2019s already packing my bag, so I guess I\u2019m doing it. Just don\u2019t expect me to get all touchy-feely about leaves and chanting.",
  "system16": "Three threads:\n\n1. Sleep through the night without whatever happens\n2. Keep Amanda from having to leave the room\n3. Stop whatever's breaking loose in your head\n\nLet's turn these into intentions.",
  "user16": "Yeah. That\u2019s... that\u2019s about right.  \n\nI want to wake up dry and quiet. I want Amanda to stay in the bed. And I want the noise in my head to shut up so I can keep doing my job without feeling like I\u2019m about to snap.",
  "system17": "Based on those threads:\n\n1. I wake up dry and quiet through the night\n2. I reclaim safety so Amanda stays in our bed\n3. I silence the noise that makes me feel ready to snap\n\nWhich speaks strongest?",
  "user17": "Number two. If she stays, the rest maybe sorts itself out.",
  "system18": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: I reclaim safety so Amanda stays in our bed\n\nHow do the other two land?",
  "user18": "They\u2019re still loud\u2014waking up soaked and shouting like some damn kid, feeling the itch in my fists every time the fridge hums wrong. I need those gone too.",
  "system19": "\u2713 All 3 locked in:\n1. I wake up dry and quiet through the night\n2. I reclaim safety so Amanda stays in our bed  \n3. I drop the itch that makes me want to snap\n\nI'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.\n\nThese intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.\n\nYou're set.",
  "user19": "Copy that. I\u2019ll keep \u2018em where I can see \u2018em."
