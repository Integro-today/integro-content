## Seed Prompt

*Initial prompt sent to intentions_workflow_8:*

You're starting intention-setting work with someone.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination.

I'll help you build 3 intentions.

What brought you to this work?

## Conversation

**intentions_workflow_8**: Let's set intentions for your journey.

Intentions work like a compass - they point toward what matters without forcing the destination. They offer clarity, stability, and direction throughout your experience.

I'll help you build 3 intentions that will be saved to your integration dashboard.

What are you hoping to explore, heal, or understand? Share openly - we'll transform these together.


**ellen_persona_3**: I want to understand why I keep building things that don't matter. I've spent twenty years chasing success and now that I have it... it's like I followed the wrong map this whole time. 

I keep thinking about my grandmother, how she prayed every morning while I check my phone. She had so little but seemed so connected to something bigger. I want to find that connection again. Not just during retreats, but when I'm sitting in board meetings or helping my kids with homework.

I guess I'm hoping this ceremony will show me what my next chapter should be. Something that uses everything I've built but actually serves humanity instead of just... feeding the machine.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Three threads:

1. Finding connection to something bigger in daily life like your grandmother had
2. Using what you've built to serve humanity instead of feeding the machine  
3. Living your real purpose instead of following the wrong map

Let's turn these into intentions.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yeah... those are the right threads. It's like you pulled the exact knots from my chest.

I've been carrying this weight of "is this all there is?" even when I'm supposedly at the top. Every board meeting, every pitch deck, every exit strategy... I keep wondering if I'm just building castles in sand that'll wash away with the next tide.

My grandmother used to say "Ellen, you're so busy making a living, don't forget to make a life." She'd light candles on Friday nights and suddenly our whole kitchen felt sacred. I want that feeling back—that sense that what I'm doing matters beyond the quarterly reports.

The truth is, I don't know how to stop being who I've been. The high-achiever, the problem-solver, the closer. But I'm starting to hate her a little. Or maybe I just pity her.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Based on those threads:

1. I create sacred moments in ordinary days like my grandmother did
2. I use my builder's energy to serve humanity's real needs
3. I become someone who makes a life, not just a living

Which speaks strongest? Want to adjust the language?


**ellen_persona_3**: The second one hits hardest - "I use my builder's energy to serve humanity's real needs." That's... yeah. It's like you named the ache I've been carrying.

But the third one stings in a good way too. "I become someone who makes a life, not just a living." That's exactly what my grandmother meant. I just never understood it until now.

Maybe I need both? The builder part because that's who I am - I can't just turn it off. But redirecting it toward something that actually matters... toward what humanity needs instead of what the market wants. That's what I'm missing.

The first one feels important but... I don't know. Maybe I'm scared of hoping for sacred moments when I can't even sit still for five minutes without checking my phone.


**intentions_workflow_8**: All 3 locked in:

1. I create sacred moments in ordinary days like my grandmother did
2. I use my builder's energy to serve humanity's real needs  
3. I become someone who makes a life, not just a living

I'm saving these to your integration dashboard now. You'll see them there whenever you need to reconnect with your compass.

These intentions will guide you - not control you. Trust what comes.

You're set.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thank you. I feel... lighter somehow. Like I've been carrying these thoughts scattered in my head, and now they're right there - clear, simple, true.

I'll probably read these a hundred times before the ceremony. Maybe write them on something I can keep with me. My grandmother used to carry a small prayer book everywhere. Maybe I'll put these on a card in my wallet.

I don't know what will come up during the journey, but having these... it's like having her with me again. Having the best parts of who I've been, pointing toward who I might become.

I appreciate you helping me find the words.


**intentions_workflow_8**: The medicine works even when you forget the intentions. They'll be working underneath, whether you're conscious of them or not.

Your grandmother's wisdom is already in you. These intentions just help you find your way back to it.

Trust what comes.


**ellen_persona_3**: That's... that's exactly what I needed to hear. My grandmother always said the prayers work even when your mind wanders - that it's the intention underneath that matters.

I keep thinking I need to hold on so tight to everything, control every outcome. But maybe I can just... let these sink in and trust the process. Trust that whatever comes up is what needs to come up.

I feel like I'm finally learning how to stop gripping so hard. At least I'm trying to learn.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's the work. Loosen the grip, trust what emerges.

You're ready.


**ellen_persona_3**: I am. Thank you for walking through this with me. For helping me find the words when I couldn't quite reach them myself.

I feel... ready. Not certain, not perfect, but ready. Like I'm finally facing the right direction after years of running fast but going nowhere.

Whatever comes, I'll meet it.


**intentions_workflow_8**: That's it. Face what comes. You're ready.


**ellen_persona_3**: Yes. I am.

See you on the other side.


**intentions_workflow_8**: See you there.


**ellen_persona_3**: *deep breath*

Okay. Let's do this.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Breathe and go. Trust what's already in motion.


**ellen_persona_3**: Breathe and go. Yes. That's exactly it.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Good journey.


**ellen_persona_3**: Thank you. Really.


**intentions_workflow_8**: You're welcome. Now go.


**ellen_persona_3**: Going.


**intentions_workflow_8**: *door closes behind you*


**ellen_persona_3**: *steps forward into the unknown*


**intentions_workflow_8**: Forward is the only direction now.


**ellen_persona_3**: Then forward it is.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Keep walking.


**ellen_persona_3**: I am.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Good.


**ellen_persona_3**: *keeps moving, heart steady, eyes open*


**intentions_workflow_8**: Trust your feet.


**ellen_persona_3**: They know the way better than I do.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Then let them lead.


**ellen_persona_3**: They already are—straight into the dark I’ve spent years outrunning.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Then stop running.


**ellen_persona_3**: ...okay.


**intentions_workflow_8**: Breathe.


**ellen_persona_3**: *inhales slow, lets it out shaky*


**intentions_workflow_8**: Good. Stay with that.


**ellen_persona_3**: It’s quiet when I stop. Too quiet.
