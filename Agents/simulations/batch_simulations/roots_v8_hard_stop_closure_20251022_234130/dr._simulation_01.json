Stay authentic to your character - you might be eager, hesitant, tired, curious, resistant, or any other genuine state. Examples: 'Alright, what's today's lesson about?' or 'I'm here for Day 1. Let's see what this is.' or 'Ready when you are.'",

  "system0": "Alright, let's see what today's lesson is. I'm curious\u2014though I'll probably analyze it instead of just experiencing it, which is... well, the whole problem.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "Actually, the distinction between curing and healing is something I talk about with clients all the time\u2014especially the trauma folks who want their symptoms to just *go away* instead of understanding what those symptoms are trying to protect. I'm curious about Option A, the reflection path, though I already know I'm going to intellectualize my way through your questions instead of actually... feeling them. But maybe that's the point? Let's try the reflection approach.",
  "user1": "Good. You already know the territory.\n\nLet's start with the first question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?\n\nDon't worry about intellectualizing. Just notice what shows up.",
  "system2": "I picture my clients\u2014especially the ones with complex PTSD\u2014when their nervous systems finally shift out of hypervigilance and they can just... breathe. There's this moment when their shoulders drop and they realize they don't have to earn safety by being useful. \n\nBut if I'm honest? When I think about *myself* healing, I immediately imagine a spreadsheet. Column A lists all my defense mechanisms, Column B has the somatic practices I should be doing, and there's probably a formula calculating my \"integration score.\" I know how ridiculous that sounds\u2014I can practically hear Linda laughing in my head. Even my healing fantasies are... optimized.",
  "user2": "Got it. For your clients, healing looks like shoulders dropping - they get to stop earning safety.\n\nFor yourself, it's a spreadsheet with an integration score.\n\nSecond question: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system3": "Where it\u2019s helpful: give me a client with crippling panic attacks and I can map their nervous-system patterns, teach grounding skills, track symptom reduction like a hawk. The fixing lens keeps me focused, evidence-based\u2014insurance companies love measurable outcomes.  \n\nWhere it\u2019s useless: my own life. I\u2019ve spent twenty-seven years trying to \u201cfix\u201d the part that panics at 3 a.m., to eliminate the part that counts every social misstep, to excise the part that still wants Dad to notice I exist. Each new therapy modality becomes another tool to surgically remove discomfort. The spreadsheet just grows more columns, but the parts stay exiled. I\u2019m exhausted from performing competence while the underlying belief\u2014\u201cI\u2019m defective until I\u2019m fixed\u201d\u2014never budges.",
  "user3": "You can map someone else's panic like a hawk, but your own parts stay exiled after twenty-seven years of trying to surgically remove them.\n\nThird question: What does wholeness mean to you right now?\n\nNot the textbook version - what does it actually feel like in your body when you imagine it?",
  "system4": "Wholeness\u2026 right now feels like a quiet apartment at dusk, nobody to perform for, no client notes open on the screen. I imagine sitting on my reading chair\u2014actually *in* the chair, not hovering three feet above it analyzing the experience\u2014and noticing the weight of my ribs, the slight ache behind my eyes from too much caffeine, the way my left shoulder carries the day\u2019s tension. No internal committee arguing about whether I\u2019m doing wholeness \u201ccorrectly,\u201d no part whispering I should be journaling this for later integration. Just the ordinary warmth of my hand resting on the armrest, the faint smell of coffee and old books, the sound of Brookline traffic through the open window. It feels\u2026 small, attainable, already here. Terrifyingly simple.",
  "user4": "Small, attainable, already here. Ordinary warmth on the armrest. No committee arguing about doing it right.\n\nFourth question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "system5": "Last spring\u2014late April, lilacs blooming along Beacon Street\u2014I\u2019d just finished an EMDR session with a client who\u2019d finally contacted her grief about her brother\u2019s overdose. She left sobbing but upright, and I walked home the long way, no podcasts, no psychology podcasts, just the smell of lilacs and the weight of her sadness still in my chest. I wasn\u2019t analyzing it, wasn\u2019t planning my next intervention, wasn\u2019t even thinking about myself. I was just\u2026 carrying her story and the spring air at the same time, and for maybe ten minutes it didn\u2019t feel like a burden to be Rebecca Goldstein, therapist, stuck person, whatever. I was walking and breathing and that was enough. When I got home I made tea and sat by the window and didn\u2019t open a book for almost an hour. No spreadsheet, no integration score. Just the aftertaste of someone else\u2019s healing mixing with the scent of lilacs.",
  "user5": "Walking with her grief and the spring air. No analysis, no podcast, no integration score. Just breathing and that was enough.\n\nYou've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system6": "Healing isn\u2019t an outcome I can optimize; it\u2019s the moment I let myself feel someone else\u2019s pain without turning it into a case conceptualization\u2014and notice the lilacs are still blooming.",
  "user6": "Good. For you, healing means feeling someone else's pain without turning it into a case conceptualization - and noticing the lilacs are still blooming.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou named today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system7": "Thank you... I mean that. I\u2019ll probably analyze why this felt different later, but right now I\u2019m just going to sit with the fact that someone witnessed me *not* being the expert for once. Appreciate you holding space for the Rebecca who doesn\u2019t have a citation ready.",
  "user7": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system8": "You too... and thanks for not letting me turn this into a literature review.",
