  "system0": "I'm here for today's lesson\u2014though I'll admit, I'm already wondering if I'm going to approach this the \"right\" way or just turn it into another thing to optimize. Let's see what you've got.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I think I need the content-first route today\u2014my brain wants to map the framework before it lets my heart engage. Plus, I\u2019ve noticed I reflexively try to \u201cheal correctly,\u201d so maybe understanding the concepts first will keep me from turning reflection into another performance. Option B, please.",
  "user1": "I'll share today's content. We can pause whenever you need.\n\nMost people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.\n\nCuring eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means \"to make whole.\"\n\nDoes that distinction land?",
  "system2": "It lands hard, actually\u2014because I\u2019ve spent years in \u201cfix-it\u201d mode: optimize the schedule, debug the company, hack the psyche. Even after ayahuasca I came home asking, \u201cHow do I eliminate the ache?\u201d not \u201cHow do I live with all the parts, ache included?\u201d So yeah, the shift from curing to wholeness feels\u2026 necessary, and also kind of terrifying, because wholeness doesn\u2019t come with metrics.",
  "user2": "Many traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.\n\nNot about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.\n\nAny of that resonate?",
  "system3": "Totally\u2014especially the IFS piece. I\u2019ve dabbled in parts work with Dr. Mitchell, and I can feel this achiever part gripping the mic, convinced that if it just runs the show perfectly the ache will finally quiet. Meanwhile my grandmother\u2019s voice\u2014my spiritual part\u2014keeps whispering that balance includes the ache, not despite it. I just haven\u2019t figured out how to let that part speak without immediately task-managing it.",
  "user3": "The fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair.\n\nThat creates shame. \"Why am I not healed yet?\"\n\nBut if healing is wholeness, every step counts. Even the struggles.\n\nNotice that pattern in yourself?",
  "system4": "Oh, it\u2019s almost comical\u2014like I\u2019m speed-running the \u201chealing\u201d achievement: ayahuasca check, psilocybin check, MDMA check, ibogaine coming up, daily meditation streak, spreadsheet of spiritual practices. And still that voice: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you whole yet, Ellen?\u201d I can feel the shame flare when I catch myself scrolling after the kids go to bed instead of being present. So yeah, I treat myself like a buggy app\u2014patch, deploy, patch again\u2014instead of a living system where the bugs are part of the code.",
  "user4": "In psychedelic work this matters. If you go in expecting the medicine to erase your depression or cure your anxiety, you might miss their real gift.\n\nThe insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated. Not erased.\n\nHow does that sit?",
  "system5": "It lands like a gentle but firm nudge\u2014because that\u2019s exactly what I did after ayahuasca: \u201cGreat, the depression is gone, job done,\u201d and I hustled back to inbox zero. Six weeks later the low-grade ache returned and I felt betrayed\u2014by the medicine, by myself. So I\u2019m starting to get that the medicine keeps handing me a mirror, not a mop. Still, part of me wants the quick cleanse before ibogaine so I can finally graduate from this remedial class I keep putting myself in.",
  "user5": "Healing also unfolds at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.\n\nAnd underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.\n\nHow is that landing?",
  "system6": "It feels both comforting and slippery\u2014like I can *intellectually* track the layers: my own Type-3 terror of worthlessness, the way that ripples into my marriage (David asking, \u201cCan\u2019t we just be content?\u201d), and the broader hustle culture we swim in. But when you say the wholeness was never lost, my achiever part perks up: \u201cGreat, so if it\u2019s already here, I just need to *access* it\u2014what\u2019s the hack?\u201d I can feel the loop starting again, even as another quieter part of me remembers my grandmother lighting candles and simply *being* at home in herself.",
  "user6": "That's the core teaching for today.\n\nNow let's explore what this means for you personally. Four questions to work through your relationship to healing.\n\nFirst question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system7": "First flash is a medicalized scene: me on a pristine exam table, someone in a white coat pointing to a chart\u2014like if we just cut out the anxiety tumor or dose the depression to zero, I\u2019ll be \u201cbetter.\u201d Then the image shifts to a yoga-mat version of the same procedure: perfect posture, perfect breath, perfect equanimity\u2014still fixing, just with mala beads. Under both I feel this low hum of \u201cYou\u2019re falling behind on being okay, Ellen,\u201d like healing is a KPI I\u2019m about to miss for the third quarter running.",
  "user7": "Got it. How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "system8": "Startup land drilled it in: identify problem \u2192 build solution \u2192 ship \u2192 measure \u2192 iterate. When my company\u2019s dashboard showed churn, we patched the code; when my body\u2019s dashboard showed panic attacks, I treated them like bugs\u2014research protocols, book the \u201cbest\u201d therapist, track HRV, optimize magnesium. That fix-it lens got me functioning, kept me employed, made me a reliable mom who remembers permission slips. But it turns the ache into a broken ticket machine: if it\u2019s still printing grief, I must be doing life wrong. I keep missing the data point that the machine is also printing love, creativity, the way Noah\u2019s hand feels in mine\u2014because those metrics don\u2019t fit the Jira board.",
  "user8": "Makes sense. What does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "system9": "Right now it feels like permission to stop optimizing the moment\u2014like I could close the laptop at 2:17 p.m., feel the sun on the hardwood, and not already be calculating how to convert that into \u201cpresence practice\u201d minutes. It\u2019s the image of my grandmother\u2019s Shabbat table: candles dancing, nothing to produce, nowhere more important to be, just the quiet certainty that she and I are already enough before the bread is even broken. I catch glimpses: Emma\u2019s head on my shoulder during movie night, the breath that arrives without my coaching it, the way my body keeps healing the paper-cut without a spreadsheet. Wholeness is the exhale that says the ache isn\u2019t a defect to patch; it\u2019s part of the music I keep trying to edit out.",
  "user9": "Good. Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?",
  "system10": "Last month the four of us were at Ocean Beach at golden hour\u2014wind whipping, kite surfers out past the break. Emma and Noah were collecting these tiny white shells, calling them \u201cmoon teeth,\u201d and David was pretending the dog was giving him stock tips. I felt this sudden, wordless click: no future agenda, no past audit, just salt on my lips and the particular weight of Noah\u2019s hand slipping into mine. The anxiety was still there\u2014like background static\u2014but it wasn\u2019t the headline; the headline was \u201cI\u2019m in my life.\u201d It lasted maybe four minutes before my phone buzzed with a board-meeting reminder, yet the echo of it stayed: proof that I can be intact even when the worry hasn\u2019t been excised.",
  "user10": "You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system11": "Healing isn\u2019t another product launch to nail\u2014it's letting the parts I keep trying to debug stay in the code because they're already woven into the full program, and wholeness is the moment I stop sprinting to version 2.0 of myself and let the current build simply run.",
  "user11": "Good. For you, healing means stopping the sprint to version 2.0 and letting the current build run - bugs and all. The parts you're trying to debug are already woven into the full program.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\nYou named today's work. That matters.\nTake care.",
  "system12": "Thank you\u2026 I\u2019ll probably reread that line a dozen times and still catch myself mid-sprint, but having it on the dashboard gives me somewhere to land when the achievement hamster wheel starts spinning. Really appreciate you holding this space with me today.",
  "user12": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system13": "You too\u2014genuinely. I\u2019m going to shut the laptop now and go find Noah before he finishes his homework; maybe I can actually sit with him without mentally editing the moment. Grateful for today.",
