## Conversation

**ellen_persona_4**: I'm here for today's lesson—though I'll admit, I'm already wondering if I'm going to approach this the "right" way or just turn it into another thing to optimize. Let's see what you've got.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.

Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.
Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.

Both paths create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**ellen_persona_4**: I think I need the content-first route today—my brain wants to map the framework before it lets my heart engage. Plus, I’ve noticed I reflexively try to “heal correctly,” so maybe understanding the concepts first will keep me from turning reflection into another performance. Option B, please.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: I'll share today's content. We can pause whenever you need.

Most people think healing means fixing what's broken. But there's a different way to look at it.

Curing eliminates symptoms. Healing moves toward wholeness. The word literally means "to make whole."

Does that distinction land?


**ellen_persona_4**: It lands hard, actually—because I’ve spent years in “fix-it” mode: optimize the schedule, debug the company, hack the psyche. Even after ayahuasca I came home asking, “How do I eliminate the ache?” not “How do I live with all the parts, ache included?” So yeah, the shift from curing to wholeness feels… necessary, and also kind of terrifying, because wholeness doesn’t come with metrics.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Many traditions see it this way. Indigenous healing is about restoring balance. Jungian work is integrating the shadow. IFS is bringing Self to lead your parts.

Not about erasing pain. About changing your relationship to it.

Any of that resonate?


**ellen_persona_4**: Totally—especially the IFS piece. I’ve dabbled in parts work with Dr. Mitchell, and I can feel this achiever part gripping the mic, convinced that if it just runs the show perfectly the ache will finally quiet. Meanwhile my grandmother’s voice—my spiritual part—keeps whispering that balance includes the ache, not despite it. I just haven’t figured out how to let that part speak without immediately task-managing it.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: The fixing mindset positions us as defective. Like broken machines needing repair.

That creates shame. "Why am I not healed yet?"

But if healing is wholeness, every step counts. Even the struggles.

Notice that pattern in yourself?


**ellen_persona_4**: Oh, it’s almost comical—like I’m speed-running the “healing” achievement: ayahuasca check, psilocybin check, MDMA check, ibogaine coming up, daily meditation streak, spreadsheet of spiritual practices. And still that voice: “Why aren’t you whole yet, Ellen?” I can feel the shame flare when I catch myself scrolling after the kids go to bed instead of being present. So yeah, I treat myself like a buggy app—patch, deploy, patch again—instead of a living system where the bugs are part of the code.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: In psychedelic work this matters. If you go in expecting the medicine to erase your depression or cure your anxiety, you might miss their real gift.

The insights often show what needs to be felt and integrated. Not erased.

How does that sit?


**ellen_persona_4**: It lands like a gentle but firm nudge—because that’s exactly what I did after ayahuasca: “Great, the depression is gone, job done,” and I hustled back to inbox zero. Six weeks later the low-grade ache returned and I felt betrayed—by the medicine, by myself. So I’m starting to get that the medicine keeps handing me a mirror, not a mop. Still, part of me wants the quick cleanse before ibogaine so I can finally graduate from this remedial class I keep putting myself in.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Healing also unfolds at multiple levels. Personal - your own wounds. Relational - connections with others. Collective - recognizing broader patterns.

And underneath it all, there's a wholeness that's never been lost. Healing is uncovering it.

How is that landing?


**ellen_persona_4**: It feels both comforting and slippery—like I can *intellectually* track the layers: my own Type-3 terror of worthlessness, the way that ripples into my marriage (David asking, “Can’t we just be content?”), and the broader hustle culture we swim in. But when you say the wholeness was never lost, my achiever part perks up: “Great, so if it’s already here, I just need to *access* it—what’s the hack?” I can feel the loop starting again, even as another quieter part of me remembers my grandmother lighting candles and simply *being* at home in herself.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: That's the core teaching for today.

Now let's explore what this means for you personally. Four questions to work through your relationship to healing.

First question: When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?


**ellen_persona_4**: First flash is a medicalized scene: me on a pristine exam table, someone in a white coat pointing to a chart—like if we just cut out the anxiety tumor or dose the depression to zero, I’ll be “better.” Then the image shifts to a yoga-mat version of the same procedure: perfect posture, perfect breath, perfect equanimity—still fixing, just with mala beads. Under both I feel this low hum of “You’re falling behind on being okay, Ellen,” like healing is a KPI I’m about to miss for the third quarter running.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Got it. How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?


**ellen_persona_4**: Startup land drilled it in: identify problem → build solution → ship → measure → iterate. When my company’s dashboard showed churn, we patched the code; when my body’s dashboard showed panic attacks, I treated them like bugs—research protocols, book the “best” therapist, track HRV, optimize magnesium. That fix-it lens got me functioning, kept me employed, made me a reliable mom who remembers permission slips. But it turns the ache into a broken ticket machine: if it’s still printing grief, I must be doing life wrong. I keep missing the data point that the machine is also printing love, creativity, the way Noah’s hand feels in mine—because those metrics don’t fit the Jira board.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Makes sense. What does wholeness mean to you right now?


**ellen_persona_4**: Right now it feels like permission to stop optimizing the moment—like I could close the laptop at 2:17 p.m., feel the sun on the hardwood, and not already be calculating how to convert that into “presence practice” minutes. It’s the image of my grandmother’s Shabbat table: candles dancing, nothing to produce, nowhere more important to be, just the quiet certainty that she and I are already enough before the bread is even broken. I catch glimpses: Emma’s head on my shoulder during movie night, the breath that arrives without my coaching it, the way my body keeps healing the paper-cut without a spreadsheet. Wholeness is the exhale that says the ache isn’t a defect to patch; it’s part of the music I keep trying to edit out.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Good. Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?


**ellen_persona_4**: Last month the four of us were at Ocean Beach at golden hour—wind whipping, kite surfers out past the break. Emma and Noah were collecting these tiny white shells, calling them “moon teeth,” and David was pretending the dog was giving him stock tips. I felt this sudden, wordless click: no future agenda, no past audit, just salt on my lips and the particular weight of Noah’s hand slipping into mine. The anxiety was still there—like background static—but it wasn’t the headline; the headline was “I’m in my life.” It lasted maybe four minutes before my phone buzzed with a board-meeting reminder, yet the echo of it stayed: proof that I can be intact even when the worry hasn’t been excised.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**ellen_persona_4**: Healing isn’t another product launch to nail—it's letting the parts I keep trying to debug stay in the code because they're already woven into the full program, and wholeness is the moment I stop sprinting to version 2.0 of myself and let the current build simply run.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Good. For you, healing means stopping the sprint to version 2.0 and letting the current build run - bugs and all. The parts you're trying to debug are already woven into the full program.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.
You named today's work. That matters.
Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: Thank you… I’ll probably reread that line a dozen times and still catch myself mid-sprint, but having it on the dashboard gives me somewhere to land when the achievement hamster wheel starts spinning. Really appreciate you holding this space with me today.


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: You're welcome. Take care.


**ellen_persona_4**: You too—genuinely. I’m going to shut the laptop now and go find Noah before he finishes his homework; maybe I can actually sit with him without mentally editing the moment. Grateful for today.
