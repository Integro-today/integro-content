  "system0": "Alright, what's today's thing about.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I dont know man. Just give me the questions.",
  "user1": "Got it. Here are the four questions:\n\n1. When I think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?\n\n2. How has my life taught me to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited me?\n\n3. What does wholeness mean to me right now?\n\n4. Can I recall a moment when I felt more whole, even if my challenges had not disappeared?\n\nStart wherever feels right.",
  "system2": "Healing means not waking Amanda up anymore. That\u2019s all.",
  "user2": "That's a heavy one. Not waking Amanda up anymore - that's your measure of healing right now.\n\nWhat's the story there?",
  "system3": "She found the Heroic Hearts thing. Said shes at her limit. I wake up shouting about the cockpit. She sleeps in the guest room half the time now.",
  "user3": "Sounds like you're fighting this war every night and she's catching the shrapnel. The cockpit dreams - military?",
  "system4": "Yeah. Afghanistan. Three tours.",
  "user4": "Three tours. That tracks.\n\nSo healing means stopping the nightmares that push Amanda away. The fixing mindset says \"eliminate these symptoms so I can sleep normal again.\"\n\nBut what if healing is different? What if it's about changing your relationship to those memories, not erasing them?\n\nWhere has the \"fix it\" approach helped you, and where has it left you stuck?",
  "system5": "Fixing works when the truck wont start or someones late on payments. You get it done. This though... i cant fix it. Tried everything.",
  "user5": "Yeah. Fixing works on trucks and late payments - concrete problems with concrete solutions.\n\nThis is different territory. Can't fix what happened. Can't fix the memories. Can't fix that Amanda's at her limit.\n\nWhat does wholeness look like when fixing isn't an option?",
  "system6": "I dont know. Guess... maybe not feeling like i have to watch every exit. Maybe sitting through dinner without feeling like i need to leave. Maybe the kids not looking at me like theyre waiting for me to explode.",
  "user6": "That's wholeness - not watching exits, staying through dinner, kids not bracing for explosion.\n\nEven if the nightmares don't vanish, even if Amanda still needs space sometimes.\n\nCan you remember a moment - even brief - when you felt more whole? When the war wasn't running the show?",
  "system7": "Two weeks ago. Sarah asked me to help with her science project. We built a volcano in the garage. She laughed when it erupted everywhere. For like twenty minutes i didnt think about anything else.",
  "user7": "Twenty minutes building volcanoes with Sarah. No exits, no war, just her laugh and the mess.\n\nThat's the piece to track. Not the absence of nightmares, but those moments when you're fully there.\n\nWhat do you make of that - that wholeness showed up in a messy garage with your daughter?",
  "system8": "I dont know. I guess... maybe its not about fixing anything. Maybe its just being there for real.",
  "user8": "Being there for real. Not fixing, just showing up.\n\nThat's today's core - healing as wholeness, not repair.\n\nWhat's your main takeaway about healing versus fixing, based on what we just explored?",
  "system9": "Healing aint fixing. Its being there for real. Like with Sarah and the volcano.",
  "user9": "Good. For you, healing means being there for real - like with Sarah and the volcano. Not fixing, just showing up.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou named today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system10": "Alright. Thanks.",
  "user10": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system11": "yeah. you too.",
