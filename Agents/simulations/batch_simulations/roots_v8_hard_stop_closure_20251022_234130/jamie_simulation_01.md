## Conversation

**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay I'm here for whatever today's thing is - though full disclosure I already forgot to check yesterday's lesson until like 11pm soooo yeah that's going well ðŸ˜… hopefully I can actually focus today but also my brain is already jumping around thinking about like 5000 other things lol


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Got it. Welcome back.

Week 1, Day 1. Today's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.

We'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).

Two ways to engage:
Option A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.
Option B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.

Both paths create a summary for your dashboard.

Which approach works for you?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: ohhh okay this is actually... wait, this feels important? Like the whole "not fixing what's broken" thing really got me because that's literally my whole life right now - I'm always trying to fix myself and be more like David and get organized and not be such a mess and - okay I'm getting ahead of myself lol

I think I want the reflection one?? Option A? Because I don't know if I can handle a bunch of frameworks right now when my brain is already like ðŸŒ€ but also what if I pick the wrong one and waste time ugh I do this every time

Option A please! (unless you think I should do B? I don't know I'm overthinking this aren't I ðŸ˜…)


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Option A is perfect. You're not overthinking - you're being thoughtful.

Let's start with the first question: When you think of the word "healing," what images or assumptions come to mind?

Don't filter it. Just whatever shows up first.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so when I think healing I immediately picture like... those Instagram posts? You know the ones - like perfect morning routines with journals and meditation pillows and matcha lattes and people who wake up at 6am and do yoga and actually remember to drink water lol

but also deeper than that I think of... being fixed? Like finally being able to use a planner without abandoning it after 3 days, actually responding to emails on time, not having my apartment look like a tornado hit it, being reliable enough that people don't have to worry about me messing things up

and then immediately I think that's probably never gonna happen for me because I've tried SO many times and I always end up back in the same place and ugh I'm sorry this got dark fast didn't it ðŸ˜…

wait I also picture my parents when they say things like "you just need to get it together" and "other people manage just fine" which makes me want to scream because don't they think I would if I COULD??


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: I hear that. The perfect morning routine fantasy - then the crash when reality doesn't match.

You've got this image of healed-you being David with his perfect systems and reliable responses. While current-you feels like a tornado.

Where did you learn that healing means becoming someone else entirely?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh wow okay that's... that's a really good question and my brain is like buzzing because I think I learned it from literally everywhere?? 

Like my parents obviously - especially my mom with her color-coded everything and my dad who wakes up at 5am to exercise before work and I'm over here like "yay I remembered to eat breakfast before 2pm!" 

But also school? Where I'd get these report cards like "Jamie is so smart but needs to apply herself" and everyone acted like I was just being lazy on purpose and I started thinking if I could just be more like the organized kids maybe life wouldn't be such chaos

and then like every job I ever had? Where I'd get fired or almost fired because I couldn't do the basic administrative stuff that everyone else just... did? Without thinking about it?

I think I just... I don't know what healing would even look like if it doesn't mean becoming someone who can function properly? Because this version of me is exhausting to be around and I wouldn't want to deal with me either lol


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Got it. You learned healing means becoming functional like everyone else seems to be. The organized kids, your parents with their systems, people who just do admin without drama.

But here's the thing - if healing isn't about fixing yourself into David, what might it be about instead?

Question 2: How has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?

Start with helpful if that's easier.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: okay so helpful... I mean it DID help me survive? Like if I hadn't at least TRIED to force myself into being more organized I probably would've flunked out of everything and been homeless or something dramatic lol - like having that fear motivated me to at least attempt systems and calendars and reminders which sometimes worked for like... a week?

and it's helpful because when I can force myself to do the thing - like respond to that client email or remember to invoice someone - then my life objectively gets better? Less crisis mode, more money, less shame spiral time

but the limiting part... oh man where do I even start?? I think it's made me hate myself? Like I genuinely don't like who I am because I'm always measuring myself against impossible standards and coming up short and then that becomes evidence that I'm broken

and it's limited because I never get to feel okay in my own skin? I'm always either failing or trying not to fail and there's no space for just... being a person? Plus I think it makes me way more anxious because I'm constantly monitoring myself like "are you doing it right yet??" instead of just living

ugh and also I think it makes me really annoying to be around? Like I'm always either apologizing for being a mess or trying really hard to seem put together and both versions feel fake and exhausting

wow okay that was a lot sorry ðŸ˜…


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: That was perfect. You named it - the survival piece AND the self-hate piece.

The fixing mindset helped you survive and function, but it's also made you feel like you're constantly failing at being human.

Question 3: What does wholeness mean to you right now?

Not the Instagram version. Just... what comes up when you hear that word?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: wholeness... okay so my first thought is like "oh great now I need to add 'be whole' to my to-do list along with be organized and successful and perfect" which is probably not the point but also completely where my brain goes lol

but when I actually try to feel into it instead of think about it... I think wholeness might be like... not having to perform all the time? Like what if I could just exist without constantly monitoring whether I'm doing life right or wrong?

and maybe wholeness is like... what if all the parts I try to cut off or hide - the scatteredness, the forgetting things, the starting 47 projects - what if those aren't actually flaws that need to be eliminated? What if they're just... part of being Jamie?

ugh that sounds so cheesy when I say it out loud but also... what if I could trust that I'm not broken? Like even with the ADHD and the missed deadlines and the chaos, what if I'm still fundamentally okay as a person?

I don't even know if that makes sense because my brain is like "but then you'll just be a disaster forever!" but also... maybe being a disaster is better than hating myself for being one? I don't know I'm confusing myself now lol


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: I hear you. Your brain immediately wants to add "be whole" to the performance list - classic.

But then you touched something real. What if wholeness means the monitoring stops? What if the scattered, project-starting, forgetful parts aren't bugs but features?

You're circling around a big shift - from "how do I fix myself?" to "what if I don't need to be fixed?"

Question 4: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges had not disappeared?

Even a small moment.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: oh... okay yeah actually I can think of one?

So like two months ago I was at pottery class (which I actually showed up to consistently because I like it and also there's no real way to be "late" to pottery lol) and I was making this really wonky mug - like it was lopsided and thick and definitely not Instagram-worthy pottery - but I was having SO much fun with it?

And I remember looking at my hands covered in clay and thinking "this is the messiest I've been in weeks and also I feel... good?" Like not anxious or behind or like I should be doing something else - just completely there making this weird little mug that was probably going to explode in the kiln

and the teacher came over and was like "I love your enthusiasm" and instead of immediately apologizing for being bad at pottery I just... smiled? And kept going?

It only lasted like an hour but I think about that feeling a lot. I wasn't being productive or successful or organized - I was just covered in clay making something ugly and somehow that was enough?

wow I actually got teary typing that out what the heck lol


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: That moment matters. Clay-covered, making something ugly, and it was enough.

You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.

In a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: I think... maybe healing isn't about becoming someone who has it all together, but about learning to stop hating myself for not being that person?

and that wholeness might be less about fixing the scattered parts and more about letting them exist without the constant self-monitoring and shame?

also I really want to go make pottery now lol


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: Good. For you, healing means stopping the self-hate for not being the together-person. Wholeness means letting your scattered parts exist without the constant monitoring.

I'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.

You named today's work. That matters.

Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: thank you... seriously. I don't know exactly what we did here but it feels like we did something important? Like maybe I touched the edge of something that could actually help instead of just another productivity hack that I'll forget about next week

and also thank you for not being like "just try harder to love yourself!" because that would've made me want to scream lol

okay I'm gonna go stare at the wall and process all this for a bit because my brain is doing that thing where it has too many thoughts at once but like... in a good way this time? If that makes sense

ðŸ’•


**roots_of_healing_-_day_1_workflow_(version_8)_workflow_1**: You're welcome. Take care.


**jamie_adhd_persona_2**: thanks... okay I'm gonna go be a person now instead of a project to fix lol

bye ðŸ’•
