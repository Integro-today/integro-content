  "system0": "Hey! So my therapist suggested I try this before doing a psychedelic ceremony. I've been doing a lot of work on myself lately and I'm really open to exploring new modalities. I'm excited to see where this goes.",
  "user0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus: what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken. Moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nTwo ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "system1": "I really appreciate how you give options - that feels much more collaborative than therapy usually is. Honestly, I've always thought healing was about fixing what was broken in me, but this idea of moving toward wholeness sounds more... I don't know, sustainable?\n\nI'll go with Option A. I think I learn better through reflection anyway, and I'd love to understand how this actually applies to my life.",
  "user1": "Got it. Option A it is.\n\nThe fixing mindset runs deep in our culture. Makes sense you'd feel that pull.\n\nLet's start with the first question: When you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "system2": "Honestly, I picture someone lying on a couch in therapy talking about their childhood, or maybe like a wellness retreat where people journal and cry together. Healing always felt like something for people who are broken - you know, people with real trauma, not just... life stuff. \n\nI guess I assumed healing meant fixing whatever's wrong with you so you can finally be normal and functional. Like there's some finish line where you're all better.",
  "user2": "I hear that. Healing as something for \"broken people\" - like there's a hierarchy of suffering that qualifies you.\n\nAnd this finish line idea. Like one day you'll arrive at \"normal\" and stay there.\n\nWhere do you think you learned that healing means fixing yourself until you're functional?",
  "system3": "Honestly? I think I picked it up everywhere - my parents, school, definitely the entertainment industry. Like, if there's a problem, you solve it. If something's broken, you fix it. If you're not getting results, you work harder until you do.\n\nMy mom always said \"Stop complaining, just fix it\" whenever I'd have any emotional reaction. And in PR, if a client has an image problem, we don't sit around exploring their feelings - we pivot, rebrand, control the narrative. \n\nI think I absorbed this idea that emotions are problems to be solved, not experiences to be... I don't know, felt?",
  "user3": "Your mom's voice: \"Stop complaining, just fix it.\" That's a powerful message to carry.\n\nAnd in PR - pivot, rebrand, control. Emotions as PR problems to manage.\n\nHow has that fixing approach worked for you? Where has it helped, and where has it limited you?",
  "system4": "It's helped me survive, honestly. When everything collapsed with the lawsuit and I lost my job, I just... pivoted. Started freelancing, rebuilt my network, found new ways to position myself. I didn't fall apart - I fixed it. My parents were impressed with how I \"handled it.\"\n\nBut relationships? That's where it gets messy. When my best friend confronted me about sleeping with her boyfriend, I tried to fix that too - explained how we both played a part, how she was being too sensitive. I was trying to solve the problem, but I ended up losing her completely. Same with my brother - when he was upset about the credit card thing, I tried to fix his feelings about it instead of just... I don't know, listening?\n\nI think I've been trying to fix people instead of connecting with them.",
  "user4": "Survival mode - that served you when everything collapsed. Got you through.\n\nBut relationships... yeah. Trying to fix your friend's pain instead of hearing it. Trying to solve your brother's feelings.\n\nThat's the cost. Fixing disconnects where connection is needed.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now? Not the textbook version - your version.",
  "system5": "Wholeness... honestly, it sounds like some Instagram wellness influencer posting about \"loving all your parts\" while filtering their photos. But if I'm being real, I think it means not having to perform all the time. Not having to charm people into seeing me a certain way.\n\nMaybe it's like... being able to sit in a room with someone and not feel like I need to manage their perception of me? Not constantly calculating how to get what I want from them. Just existing without that strategic layer.\n\nI don't even know if that's possible for me though.",
  "user5": "Not performing. Not managing how others see you. Just existing without the strategic calculations.\n\nThat sounds exhausting - constantly calculating angles while trying to connect.\n\nCan you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared? Even a small moment?",
  "system6": "Actually... this is going to sound weird, but last month I was at this networking event and I ran into this woman who's like a big deal in the wellness space. Everyone was trying to impress her, get her contact info. And I just... didn't. We ended up talking about Korean skincare for like twenty minutes, just two Korean-American women sharing products our moms used. She asked for my number after, but I didn't even follow up.\n\nIt was just this moment where I wasn't trying to get anything from her. I wasn't calculating how to turn it into business or how to make her like me. For like twenty minutes, I was just... there. Not performing.\n\nI guess that maybe felt like wholeness?",
  "user6": "Twenty minutes talking Korean skincare. No angle, no calculation. Just two Korean-American women sharing what your moms used.\n\nThat sounds like wholeness. You weren't trying to get anything - you were just there.\n\nLast question: Can you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?\n\nYou already answered it with the skincare story.",
  "system7": "Yeah, I guess I did. It's funny how that moment stuck with me - like my brain keeps going back to it and analyzing why it felt so different. Maybe because for once I wasn't trying to be valuable or useful or impressive. I was just... a person talking about something real.\n\nHonestly, that might be the most honest conversation I've had in months.",
  "user7": "You've done the core work. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "system8": "I think healing isn't about fixing what's broken - it's about being real, even if that realness doesn't get me anything or make me look good. And wholeness might mean those rare moments when I stop performing and just exist without calculating the angle.\n\nThough honestly, I'm still not sure how to create more of those moments without turning them into another strategy.",
  "user8": "Good. For you, healing means being real even when it doesn't get you anything or make you look good. Wholeness is those rare moments when you stop performing and just exist without calculating the angle.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou named today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
  "system9": "Thank you. I appreciate how you held space for this today - it's not easy for me to sit with this stuff without trying to manage how it's all landing.\n\nI'll probably need to revisit this conversation a few times before the ceremony.",
  "user9": "You're welcome. Take care.",
  "system10": "You too. Thanks for walking through this with me - I know I'm not the easiest person to work with.",
  "user10": "You're welcome. Take care.",
