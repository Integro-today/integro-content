  "max_turns": 20,
  "system0": "Look, I don't know how this is supposed to work, but Heroic Hearts says I need to set some intentions before I go down to Costa Rica. I just need to stop waking up Amanda with my shouting, and I can't lose her.",
  "user0": "I hear you - the nightmares are impacting your relationship in a way that feels urgent, and you're facing the possibility of losing someone who matters deeply to you. That's a heavy place to be.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what you need most without forcing a specific outcome. For veterans working with psychedelics, intentions can help guide the healing process, especially when you're dealing with trauma that's affecting your relationships.\n\nI can help you craft 3 clear intentions for your Costa Rica journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through some questions to explore what you're really hoping to heal or understand. Together we'll build intentions that address both the trauma and keeping your relationship with Amanda.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more about how intention-setting works with veterans and trauma healing first.\n\nWhich feels right to start with?",
  "system1": "Option A. Just... don't call it PTSD, okay? I need to figure out how to stop the nightmares without making me into something I'm not.",
  "user1": "Got it - no labels, just what you're dealing with. The nightmares that wake you up shouting, the fear of losing Amanda because of it, and wanting to stay who you are while finding some peace.\n\nLet's start here: When you think about what you want to be different after this journey in Costa Rica, what matters most to you?",
  "system2": "I need to sleep through the night without scaring my wife. That's it. If I can do that... maybe I won't see that look in her eyes anymore, like she's waiting for me to break. I just want to be the man she married, not this... whatever I've become.",
  "user2": "You want to reclaim the version of yourself that Amanda felt safe with - the one who didn't wake up screaming, who didn't make her feel like she has to walk on eggshells. That makes sense.\n\nTell me about those moments when you're awake and everything feels normal. What do you and Amanda share that still feels solid or good between you?",
  "system3": "Sunday mornings... when the kids are still asleep and we're just drinking coffee together. She still makes that little joke about how I take it too strong, same as when we were dating. And when she reaches for my hand at church - that still feels right, like we've got our own secret thing in the middle of all that noise.\n\nSometimes she'll catch my eye when one of the kids does something stupid, and we just... we get it. We laugh without saying anything. Those moments, it's like I'm still me for a second.",
  "user3": "Those moments when you catch each other's eyes and share that unspoken understanding - that's the connection you're fighting to keep. The man who can still make her laugh without words, who has that private language built over years together.\n\nWhat do you think the nightmares are trying to tell you? Not the content, but what do you think your mind is wrestling with when you're asleep?",
  "system4": "I don't know. Maybe it's just... everything I couldn't control over there. In the cockpit, I had to be perfect - one mistake and people die. Here, I can't even control my own damn dreams. It's like my body remembers things my mind won't let me look at.\n\nSometimes I think it's the guys we lost. The ones who didn't make it back. I carry them with me, I guess.",
  "user4": "You carry the weight of those who didn't come back, and it sounds like your body remembers what your mind won't let you fully face. That makes sense - the responsibility of perfection in the cockpit, the loss of control at night when you should feel safest.\n\nWhen you think about those Sunday morning moments with Amanda, what do you want her to know about who you are now? Not the version from before, but the man who's still reaching for her hand across all this distance?",
  "system5": "That I'm still trying. That even when I'm angry or distant, I'm fighting for us. I want her to know I'd never hurt her, even when she sees me at my worst. That she's the only thing that makes any of this matter.\n\nI guess... I want her to know I'm not giving up on being her husband, even when I don't know how to fix what's broken.",
  "user5": "That determination to keep fighting for your marriage, even when you don't have the answers - that's the core of who you are right now. The man who's still trying, who's still reaching for her hand, who's carrying the weight of what happened over there.\n\nI'm hearing three main threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Finding peace in your body so you can sleep without the nightmares\n2. Reconnecting with the version of yourself that Amanda can feel safe with\n3. Letting go of needing to control everything and trusting you can still protect what matters\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system6": "Yeah. I just... I don't want to lose her. And I need to figure out how to stop carrying all this weight without forgetting the guys who didn't make it back. I need to find a way to be whole again - not perfect, just... not broken.",
  "user6": "You want to stay connected to your brothers who didn't come back, but carry their memory in a way that doesn't destroy the life you're trying to build with Amanda. And you're not asking to be perfect - just to feel whole again, like you can be the husband she deserves.\n\nBased on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I open myself to peaceful sleep, releasing the weight I carry so I can be fully present with Amanda\n2. I seek to reconnect with my authentic self - the man who can still make Amanda laugh over Sunday morning coffee\n3. I welcome a new way to honor my fallen brothers that lets me move forward with strength rather than just survival\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system7": "The sleep one. I need to sleep. And I want to honor them the right way, not just... carrying them like dead weight.\n\nBut I need something stronger. Something that doesn't make me sound weak. \"Open myself\" - I don't know about that part. I'm not opening myself to anything. I'm taking back control.",
  "user7": "That makes sense - you're not passively receiving peace, you're actively reclaiming control over your own body and nights. Let me reframe that first one:\n\n\"I reclaim peaceful sleep and take back control of my nights, releasing the weight I carry so I can be fully present with Amanda\"\n\nHow does that feel? The shift from \"open myself\" to \"reclaim\" and \"take back control\" - that's the language of someone who's fought for what matters and isn't done fighting.",
  "system8": "Yeah. That's better. I can work with that.",
  "user8": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: *I reclaim peaceful sleep and take back control of my nights, releasing the weight I carry so I can be fully present with Amanda*\n\nNow let's look at honoring your fallen brothers. You mentioned wanting to find \"the right way\" - not just carrying them like dead weight, but something that honors their memory while letting you move forward with strength.\n\nWhat would it look like to honor them in a way that actually makes you stronger? Not just surviving, but becoming the man they would have wanted you to be?",
  "system9": "I become the man they would be proud to have served with. Not this angry, tired version. The man who builds something good with the life I got to keep living.\n\nThey didn't get to come home to their families. I did. I need to make that mean something. Be someone worth the sacrifice.",
  "user9": "That's powerful - becoming someone worth the sacrifice they made. Building something good with the life you got to keep living while they didn't make it home to their families.\n\nHow about:\n\n\"I reclaim my identity as the man my fallen brothers would be proud to serve with, building something meaningful with the life I carry forward for all of us\"\n\nDoes that capture what you're reaching for? The shift from angry and tired to someone who builds something meaningful with this second chance?",
  "system10": "Yeah. I'm building something with this life they don't get to live. Not wasting it being angry. That's good.",
  "user10": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: *I reclaim my identity as the man my fallen brothers would be proud to serve with, building something meaningful with the life I carry forward for all of us*\n\nNow for the third one - reconnecting with who you are with Amanda. You talked about wanting her to know you're still fighting for her, that you're not giving up on being her husband even when you don't know how to fix what's broken.\n\nWhat would it look like to become whole enough to be the husband she deserves? Not perfect - just whole again.",
  "system11": "I need to remember how to be gentle again. How to let her in instead of pushing her away when I'm struggling. I used to make her laugh over Sunday coffee. I want to find that man again - the one who could hold her without her flinching.",
  "user11": "That Sunday morning version of you who could make her laugh - that's who you're fighting to get back to. The man who could hold her without making her flinch, who lets her in instead of pushing her away when the weight gets heavy.\n\nHow about:\n\n\"I reclaim my ability to be gentle and let Amanda in, becoming the man who can hold her without her flinching and make her laugh over Sunday morning coffee again\"\n\nDoes that capture the husband you're fighting to become - gentle enough to let love in, strong enough to stop pushing her away?",
  "system12": "Yeah. That's it. That's who I want to be again.",
  "user12": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: *I reclaim my ability to be gentle and let Amanda in, becoming the man who can hold her without her flinching and make her laugh over Sunday morning coffee again*\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now - each one about reclaiming something essential they tried to break in you. \n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Keep them in your wallet with your dog tags\n- Write them where you see your gear\n- Record yourself reading them in your own voice\n- Read them before you take any meds\n- Keep them somewhere Amanda might see them too\n\nWhat feels right for you - something that helps you remember who you're fighting to become?",
  "system13": "I'll keep them with my dog tags. Been carrying those tags for years - they go where I go. These intentions belong there too.",
  "user13": "That fits - your dog tags have carried you through everything, and these intentions belong right there with them.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. I reclaim peaceful sleep and take back control of my nights, releasing the weight I carry so I can be fully present with Amanda\n2. I reclaim my identity as the man my fallen brothers would be proud to serve with, building something meaningful with the life I carry forward for all of us  \n3. I reclaim my ability to be gentle and let Amanda in, becoming the man who can hold her without her flinching and make her laugh over Sunday morning coffee again\n\nYour chosen ritual: Keep them with your dog tags\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The medicine will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nThis work takes courage - facing what you've been carrying, fighting to become the man your brothers would be proud of and the husband Amanda deserves. Wishing you strength on this journey.",
  "system14": "Thank you. I'll carry these with me.",
  "user14": "You're welcome. Carry them well, soldier. Your brothers walk with you, and Amanda's waiting for you to come home whole.\n\nWhen you're ready to begin, just breathe and trust what unfolds. You've done the hard work of facing what needs healing - now let the medicine do its work.",
  "system15": "Roger that.",

  "system16": "Hooah.",
