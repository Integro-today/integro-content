  "max_turns": 15,
  "system0": "Hello! I'd like to explore some ideas with you. What are your thoughts on personal growth and transformation?",
  "user0": "Hello! I'm here to help you craft meaningful intentions for an upcoming psychedelic journey. It sounds like you're in an exploratory space around personal growth and transformation - that's a rich place to begin.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. Intentions help guide psychedelic experiences toward healing and growth, different from rigid goals because they allow space for surprises and unexpected healing.\n\nI can help you craft 3 intentions for your journey:\n\n**Option A: Interactive Intention-Setting Process**\nI'll guide you through a conversational process where we'll explore what you want to heal, understand, or discover. Together we'll craft 3 intentions that feel authentic and meaningful to you.\n\n**Option B: Read More About Intention Setting**\nI can share more detailed information about intention-setting practices, examples, and how others have approached this process before you begin.\n\nWhich would you like to explore first?",
  "system1": "I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this plant medicine might help with... everything. Here I am. I can't keep going like this.\n\nLook, I don't buy into all this mystical stuff. But Amanda says I scare her sometimes when I wake up shouting. I hate that. I need to figure out how to shut it off without losing who I am.\n\nWhat's this intention thing supposed to do?",
  "user1": "I hear you - being told you scare someone you care about when you're just trying to sleep, that's heavy. And you're here because you trust Amanda enough to try something you don't fully believe in. That takes guts.\n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey - it points toward what matters without forcing a specific outcome. For someone who doesn't buy into mystical stuff, think of it as setting a clear direction: \"I want to understand and quiet these nightmares without losing the parts of me that kept me alive.\" The medicine works with whatever you bring, intentions just help focus it.\n\nI can help you craft 3 clear intentions:\n\n**Option A: Interactive Process** - I'll ask some straight questions about what you're dealing with, and we'll build intentions together that make sense to you.\n\n**Option B: More Info First** - I can explain more about how this works and share examples from other veterans who've done this work.\n\nWhich feels right to you?",
  "system2": "Option A. Let's get this over with.\n\nI need to sleep through the night without waking up drenched in sweat. Need to stop jumping at loud noises like some damn rookie. Need to figure out how to be around my kids without this... edge... all the time.\n\nAmanda deserves better than what I'm giving her.",
  "user2": "That edge you're talking about - it's exhausting carrying that all day, isn't it? Always scanning, always ready, even when you're supposed to be safe at home with your kids.\n\nWhat's the hardest part for you right now - the way your body betrays you with the sweats and jumping, or how it pushes Amanda and the kids away?",
  "system3": "The second one. I can handle my own body being broken. Been doing that for years.\n\nBut watching my 14-year-old flinch when I slam a cabinet door too hard? Seeing Amanda's face when I wake up shouting again? That's what kills me.\n\nI'm supposed to be the one who protects them. Not the one they need protecting from.",
  "user3": "That betrayal cuts deep - when the very instincts that kept you alive over there are hurting the people you're trying to protect here. Watching your kid flinch from your reflexes, seeing Amanda's face shift from concern to fear... that's a special kind of hell.\n\nWhat do you want to feel when you're with them instead of that edge? If you could replace that constant readiness with something else, what would it be?",
  "system4": "I want to feel... steady. Like I used to be before everything got twisted up.\n\nWant to sit through dinner without scanning every damn corner. Want to watch a movie with my kids without jumping when something explodes on screen. Want to hold Amanda without her feeling like she's hugging a loaded weapon.\n\nJust want to be the man they think I am. Not this... whatever I've become.",
  "user4": "That gap between who they see and who you feel like inside - that's painful. Wanting to be steady again, to sit through dinner without scanning for threats, to hold Amanda without her feeling that tension you can't hide.\n\nWhat do you think you've become that you don't want to be anymore? And what parts of that man they think you are - what parts are still actually you underneath all this?",
  "system5": "I've become some... guard dog that can't tell friend from threat anymore. Always ready to bite.\n\nBut I'm still the guy who gets up at 4:30 to run, who built that business from nothing. Still the guy who shows up when people need help. Still the guy who wants to do right by his family.\n\nI just need to figure out how to turn off the alarm bells that keep ringing for no damn reason.",
  "user5": "I hear that - there's still the disciplined, reliable guy who built something from nothing and shows up for people. It's like the alarm system got stuck on high alert, but the rest of you is still in there.\n\nWhat would it feel like to sit at dinner and just... be there? No scanning, no bracing for something to go wrong? To hear a loud noise and just register it as noise instead of a threat?\n\nAnd when you think about this plant medicine journey - what are you hoping it might show you about turning those alarms down?",
  "system6": "I don't know what it feels like anymore. Been running on this frequency for so long, I can't remember what quiet feels like.\n\nMaybe... maybe I could just sit there and actually taste the food. Hear what my kids are saying instead of listening for trouble. Not feel like I got to keep my back to the wall.\n\nI don't know what this medicine shows people. But if it could help me figure out how to turn down the volume on... whatever this is... without losing the parts that matter? That's worth trying.",
  "user6": "That's it exactly - wanting to taste the food, hear your kids, not need your back to the wall. Wanting quiet without losing the parts that kept you alive and built your life.\n\nI'm hearing three core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Wanting to turn down those false alarms so you can be present with your family\n2. Reclaiming your role as protector without being a threat yourself  \n3. Finding steadiness - that quiet confidence you used to have\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your journey.",
  "system7": "Yeah. That's... that's it.\n\nHow do we turn that into something I can actually use? Something that makes sense?",
  "user7": "Based on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. I welcome steadiness and calm presence with my family\n2. I open myself to releasing false alarms that keep me on edge\n3. I reclaim my role as protector without becoming what threatens them\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system8": "The first one. That's what I want most - steadiness when I'm with them.\n\nCan we make it stronger though? Something about being the man they deserve. Not just \"welcome\" - I need to BE that steadiness.",
  "user8": "How about: \"I become the steady presence my family deserves\" - does that capture what you're seeking? That shift from \"welcome\" to \"become\" feels important here.",
  "system9": "That's better. I become the steady presence my family deserves.\n\nBut it needs... something more. About protecting them with my calm instead of my anger. About being steady even when things get loud or unexpected.\n\nI don't know how to say it right.",
  "user9": "What about: \"I become the steady presence my family deserves, protecting them with calm instead of anger\"?\n\nHow does that feel? Does it need something about staying steady through surprises, or does that capture the shift from threat to calm protection?",
  "system10": "That's good. That works.\n\nBut I need to add something about the loud noises. The surprises. That's where I break down - when something slams or crashes, I'm right back there.\n\nSo... \"I become the steady presence my family deserves, protecting them with calm instead of anger, even when things get loud.\"\n\nThat's what I need to carry in there.",
  "user10": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I become the steady presence my family deserves, protecting them with calm instead of anger, even when things get loud.\"\n\nThat's powerful - you can feel the shift from reactive to steady, from anger to calm protection.\n\nReady to work on intention 2? You mentioned wanting to turn down those false alarms that keep you on edge. What would that look like when they're quieted?",
  "system11": "When they're quieted... I could just hear what's actually happening. Not every sound being something I need to check out or prepare for.\n\nLike sitting here right now - instead of listening for doors, footsteps, that weird hum in the ceiling. Just... being here. With you. With myself.\n\nI want to know what's real danger and what's just life happening around me.",
  "user11": "What about: \"I reclaim my ability to hear what's real - distinguishing true danger from the everyday sounds of life\"?\n\nDoes that capture being able to sit with what's actually happening instead of scanning for threats? Or would you frame it differently?",
  "system12": "\"I reclaim my ability to hear what's real\" - that's good. That's what I want.\n\nBut I need it to be about more than just hearing. It's about knowing. Being certain about what's actually a threat so I'm not jumping at everything.\n\nHow about: \"I reclaim my ability to know what's real - distinguishing true danger from the everyday sounds of life.\"\n\nThat feel more solid to me.",
  "user12": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I reclaim my ability to know what's real - distinguishing true danger from the everyday sounds of life.\"\n\nThat shift from \"hear\" to \"know\" makes all the difference - it's about that inner certainty, not just the sounds.\n\nReady for intention 3? You talked about reconnecting with the man you used to be - the one who could be gentle, who wasn't always on guard. What's the heart of that for you?",
  "system13": "The heart of it... I used to be able to just be with people. Before everything was about watching exits and reading rooms. \n\nI want to be able to sit with Amanda without feeling like I need to be ready for something. Be able to hug my kids without my body being tense. Just... be a man who's not always bracing for impact.\n\nI want to remember how to be soft without feeling like I'm letting my guard down.",
  "user13": "What about: \"I remember how to be soft without letting my guard down - reclaiming the man who can simply be with people without bracing for impact\"?\n\nDoes that capture being able to sit with Amanda and hug your kids without that constant tension?",
  "system14": "That's close. But I don't want to say \"letting my guard down\" - that sounds like I'm choosing to be unsafe. \n\nHow about: \"I remember how to be soft while staying strong - reclaiming the man who can simply be with people without bracing for impact.\"\n\nThat feels better. I can still be the protector, just... not wound so tight all the time.",
  "user14": "\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I remember how to be soft while staying strong - reclaiming the man who can simply be with people without bracing for impact.\"\n\nThat's beautiful - holding both truths at once. You can protect without being wound tight.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I become the steady presence my family deserves, protecting them with calm instead of anger, even when things get loud.\"\n2. \"I reclaim my ability to know what's real - distinguishing true danger from the everyday sounds of life.\"\n3. \"I remember how to be soft while staying strong - reclaiming the man who can simply be with people without bracing for impact.\"\n\nHow do you want to keep these close? Some options:\n- Keep them on a card with your dog tags or something you carry\n- Read them before you start each day\n- Record yourself saying them to listen to\n- Write them in a journal you keep nearby\n\nWhat feels right for you?"
