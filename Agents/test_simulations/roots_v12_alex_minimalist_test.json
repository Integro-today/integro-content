  "system0": "Welcome. Week 1, Day 1.\n\nToday's focus is what healing really means. Not fixing what's broken, but moving toward wholeness.\n\nWe'll explore the difference between curing (eliminating symptoms) and healing (integrating all parts of yourself).\n\nThere are two ways to engage:\nOption A: Reflection-based. Four questions exploring your relationship to healing. Teaching woven throughout.\nOption B: Content-first. Understand the frameworks and concepts before reflecting on them.\n\nBoth paths create a summary for your dashboard.\n\nWhich approach works for you?",
  "user0": "idk",
  "system1": "Both get you to the same place. A is more exploratory, B is more structured. Your call.",
  "user1": "A",
  "system2": "Got it. Let's start with your relationship to healing.\n\nWhen you think of the word \"healing,\" what images or assumptions come to mind?",
  "user2": "sleep",
  "system3": "Sleep as healing. Makes sense - it's restorative, essential.\n\nHow has your life taught you to see healing as fixing? Where has that perspective been helpful, and where has it limited you?",
  "user3": "need to fix mom",
  "system4": "That sounds heavy. Wanting to fix your mom - that's a powerful pull.\n\nWhat does wholeness mean to you right now?",
  "user4": "cant think about that",
  "system5": "Got it. Let's try a different angle.\n\nCan you recall a moment when you felt more whole, even if your challenges hadn't disappeared?",
  "user5": "before",
  "system6": "Before. Before what happened with your mom?\n\nYou've completed the core work for today. Now let's pull it together.\n\nIn a sentence or two, what's the main thing you're taking from today? About healing, about wholeness, about yourself?",
  "user6": "need rest",
  "system7": "Good. For you, healing means needing rest - sleep as restoration, not fixing. Just being before everything got complicated.\n\nI'm adding that to your dashboard. You can revisit it anytime.\n\nYou showed up for today's work. That matters.\n\nTake care.",
