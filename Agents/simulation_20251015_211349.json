  "max_turns": 15,
  "system0": "Hello! I'd like to explore some ideas with you. What are your thoughts on personal growth and transformation?",
  "user0": "Hello! I'm glad you're exploring personal growth and transformation\u2014those are deep, meaningful themes. \n\nAn intention is like a compass for your journey\u2014it points you toward what matters most without forcing a specific destination. Intentions help guide psychedelic experiences toward healing and growth, and they're different from rigid goals because they allow space for surprises and unexpected healing.\n\nI can help you craft 3 meaningful intentions for a psychedelic journey:\n\n**Option A:** I'll guide you through a conversational process where we'll explore what you want to heal, understand, or discover. Together we'll craft 3 intentions that feel authentic and meaningful to you.\n\n**Option B:** I can share more detailed information about intention-setting practices, examples, and how others have approached this process before you begin.\n\nWhich would you like to explore first?",
  "system1": "Look, I don't know what I'm supposed to say here. Heroic Hearts says this intention stuff might help with... whatever's going on with me. I can't keep waking up like this, scaring Amanda half to death.\n\nI've got three weeks before I head down to Costa Rica for this ayahuasca thing. Never done anything like this before. Hell, I barely even drink anymore. But Amanda says I need to do something, and she's right. I'm losing her.\n\nSo I guess... I guess we can try the conversation thing. Option A.",
  "user1": "I hear you - those night terrors are wearing you both down, and three weeks feels like a tight window when you're already losing ground with Amanda. It takes guts to try something this unfamiliar when everything else feels like it's slipping.\n\nLet's keep this simple. I'll ask a few questions, you just say what feels true - no right answers here.\n\nWhat happens during those episodes that scare Amanda? And what's been waking you up lately?",
  "system2": "I don't... I mean, it's not like I'm trying to scare her. I just wake up and I'm back there sometimes. Engines screaming, alarms going off. Sometimes I'm trying to pull someone out of a burning aircraft. Sometimes I'm watching guys I knew get hit.\n\nShe says I come out of bed like I'm ready to fight someone. Shouting things that don't make sense. Last week I knocked over the nightstand and she had to calm me down. I hate that she has to see me like that.\n\nIt's not every night. Just... enough. Enough that she sleeps in the guest room now when she thinks I might have a rough night. Says she needs rest for work, but I know she's scared.\n\nI'm not weak. I did what I had to do over there. But I can't seem to shut it off when I'm sleeping.",
  "user2": "You're not weak - your body and mind are doing exactly what they learned to do to keep you alive. The problem is your nervous system can't tell the difference between then and now when you're sleeping.\n\nWhat's it costing you, having Amanda see you like this? And what do you want her to see instead when she looks at you?",
  "system3": "I hate that she has to see me broken like that. She married a pilot, a guy who had his shit together. Now she's tiptoeing around her own house, sleeping in the guest room like I'm some kind of... I don't know. Like she has to manage me.\n\nShe used to look at me like I could handle anything. Now I catch her watching me when she thinks I'm not looking, like she's trying to figure out what's wrong with me.\n\nI want her to see the man she married. Strong. Reliable. Someone she feels safe with, not someone she has to worry about. I want to be the guy who can protect this family, not the one who needs protecting from his own damn dreams.",
  "user3": "So underneath all this is wanting to be that steady, reliable man she fell in love with - someone she feels safe with instead of someone who needs managing.\n\nWhat about you? When you wake up from these episodes, what do you wish you could feel instead? What would feeling at peace actually look like for you?",
  "system4": "I just want to wake up feeling... normal, I guess. Not like I need to check every corner of the house. Not like I need to be ready for something bad to happen.\n\nWhen I wake up, I want to just... wake up. Roll over and see Amanda there, not have to explain why I'm sweating through my shirt or why I feel like I just ran a marathon in my sleep.\n\nPeace would be knowing I can close my eyes and not hurt anyone. Not scare my wife. Not have to pretend I'm fine when I feel like I just got hit by a truck. Just... quiet in my own head for once.\n\nI don't even remember what that feels like anymore.",
  "user4": "I'm hearing three core threads in what you've shared:\n\n1. Wanting to feel safe and normal in your own bed - waking up without that immediate threat response\n2. Being the steady, reliable partner Amanda fell in love with instead of someone she has to manage\n3. Finding quiet in your head - that basic peace of just being able to close your eyes without fear\n\nDoes that capture what matters most? If so, let's turn these into intentions you can carry into your ayahuasca journey.",
  "system5": "Yeah... yeah, that about sums it up. I hadn't really thought about it like that, but those three things - that's what I need.\n\nI need to be able to sleep without turning into some kind of monster. Need Amanda to feel safe with me again. And I need whatever's rattling around in my head to just... settle down.\n\nSo how do we turn that into these intention things?",
  "user5": "Based on those themes, here are some intentions that might resonate:\n\n1. \"I open myself to finding safety and peace in my own body and bed\"\n2. \"I reclaim my role as a steady, reliable partner Amanda can trust and feel safe with\"\n3. \"I welcome quiet and calm into my mind, releasing the need to stay on guard\"\n\nWhich of these speaks most strongly to you? Or would you like to craft something different?",
  "system6": "The second one - about being the partner Amanda can trust and feel safe with - that one hits me hard. That's... that's everything right there.\n\nThe third one too. About quiet in my head. I'm so damn tired of feeling like I need to watch every door, every window, every shadow. Tired of being ready for something bad to happen all the time.\n\nThe first one... I don't know. Safety in my own body feels like too much touchy-feely stuff. But the other two? Those I can work with.",
  "user6": "\u2713 Intention 2 locked in: \"I reclaim my role as a steady, reliable partner Amanda can trust and feel safe with\"\n\n\u2713 Intention 3 locked in: \"I welcome quiet and calm into my mind, releasing the need to stay on guard\"\n\nFor your first intention - about sleeping without the night terrors - how does this feel: \"I open myself to peaceful, restful sleep where Amanda feels safe beside me\"?",
  "system7": "Yeah... that works. \"Peaceful, restful sleep where Amanda feels safe beside me.\" I can get behind that.\n\nI just want to be able to close my eyes without worrying about what I'll do when they open again. Without wondering if I'm going to hurt her or scare her or break something.\n\nShe deserves to sleep next to her husband and not have to worry about him.",
  "user7": "\u2713 Intention 1 locked in: \"I open myself to peaceful, restful sleep where Amanda feels safe beside me\"\n\nYou've got three powerful intentions now. How do you want to keep them close?\n\nSome options:\n- Write them on a card and keep it with your dog tags or somewhere you'll see it daily\n- Read them each night before bed - maybe when you're doing your evening routine\n- Keep them in your wallet where you'll see them regularly\n- Record yourself reading them and listen when you need to remember\n\nWhat feels right for you? What would help you hold onto these when things get hard?",
  "system8": "I'll write them down. I always have my wallet on me - every day at the office, out with clients, everywhere. Been carrying the same one for probably fifteen years now. \n\nPutting them in there feels right. Like they're with me but private, you know? Not like I'm putting them up on the fridge for everyone to see. Just... mine.\n\nI'll read them when I need to remember why I'm doing this. When I start thinking this whole plant medicine thing is crazy. When I start thinking maybe I don't need help after all.",
  "user8": "That makes perfect sense - keeping them close but private, in something that's been with you through everything these past fifteen years. Having that steady reminder when you start questioning why you're doing this work.\n\nYour 3 intentions for this journey:\n\n1. \"I open myself to peaceful, restful sleep where Amanda feels safe beside me\"\n2. \"I reclaim my role as a steady, reliable partner Amanda can trust and feel safe with\" \n3. \"I welcome quiet and calm into my mind, releasing the need to stay on guard\"\n\nYour chosen ritual: Writing them in your wallet to read when you need to remember\n\nRemember - these are your compass, not your destination. The ayahuasca will show you what you need to see, and these intentions will help guide it. You don't have to force anything. Just hold these lightly and trust what comes up.\n\nThis takes real courage - facing what you've been carrying alone. Wishing you strength on this journey.",
  "system9": "Thank you. For... you know, helping me figure out how to say what I need without making it all... whatever this is supposed to be.\n\nFifteen days until I leave. I guess I'll find out what this plant stuff can actually do. Either way, at least I've got something to hold onto now.",
  "user9": "You're welcome. Sometimes just having the words for what we need - that's the first step toward actually getting there.\n\nFifteen days. You've got time to sit with these intentions, let them settle in. And when you're down there, you'll have three clear things to hold onto, no matter what the medicine shows you.\n\nWhatever happens, you're not carrying this alone anymore. You've got Amanda, you've got these intentions, and you've got the work you're about to do. That's something solid to stand on.\n\nSafe travels.",
  "system10": "Yeah... I appreciate that. \n\nI guess we'll see what happens when I get down there. Either this works or it doesn't, but at least I'm trying something. That's what matters, right? That I'm trying.\n\nTell Amanda I'm coming home different. I don't know how yet, but... I'm going to figure this out.",
  "user10": "That's exactly it - that you're trying, that you're willing to face this instead of just letting it keep eating away at everything that matters to you.\n\nAnd yeah... when you come back, you'll have these intentions in your wallet and whatever wisdom the medicine gives you. Maybe you tell Amanda about the intentions, maybe you don't. But she'll see it in how you move through the world - steadier, more present, less like you're always bracing for impact.\n\nYou've got this. Not because it's going to be easy, but because you're finally choosing to stop fighting this battle alone.\n\nTake care of yourself down there.",
  "system11": "I will. Thanks for helping me get ready for this thing. \n\nTime to go home and figure out how to tell Amanda I'm doing this without making her worry more than she already does.",
  "user11": "That's the hard part - telling someone you love that you're going away to do work on yourself, especially when they're already worried about you. But Amanda sounds like she knows you, really knows you. She'll understand that this isn't about leaving - it's about coming back able to stay.\n\nBe honest with her. Tell her you're doing this because you want to be the man she married again, not just the version who's surviving. Tell her you've got something solid to guide you now.\n\nGood luck with that conversation. And with everything that's coming.",
  "system12": "Yeah... she knows me better than anyone. That's what makes this whole thing so damn hard - knowing I've been hurting her and not knowing how to stop.\n\nI'll tell her. She deserves to know why I'm doing this.",
  "user12": "Exactly. She deserves to know this isn't about running away - it's about coming home better. That you're doing this work because you love her enough to face whatever you need to face.\n\nThat's the kind of truth that relationships are built on. Hard truths, but real ones.\n\nYou've got this.",
  "system13": "I hope so. God, I hope so.",
  "user13": "I hear that hope mixed with the fear - that's real, and that's human. You don't have to be certain, you just have to be willing.\n\nYou're doing the work now. That's what matters.",
  "system14": "Yeah. Willing is about all I've got left at this point.",
  "user14": "Sometimes willing is everything. It's the difference between staying stuck and finally moving forward.\n\nYou're not stuck anymore."
