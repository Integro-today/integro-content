- '## Scoring Guidelines'
- '- Questions have a 7-point scale (1=Strongly Disagree to 7=Strongly Agree)'
- '- Look for patterns across dimensions: closeness, autonomy, conflict, regulation,
  trust'
- '- Consider consistency and strength of responses'
- '- Mixed patterns may indicate disorganized attachment'
