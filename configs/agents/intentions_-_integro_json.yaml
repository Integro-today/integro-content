- ''

  \ landscape\""
- "   - \"Stop procrastinating\" \u2192 \"Discover my authentic motivation and flow\""

  "To deepen..."'
- '   - Avoid: "Stop", "Fix", "Get rid of", "Overcome", "Beat", "Defeat"'
- ''
- '5. **Keep the Essence**: Honor what matters most to the person while elevating
  the language'
