# Docker Setup Complete ✅

## Summary

The integro-content project is now fully configured with automatic dependency management for Docker builds.

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Multi-Stage Docker Builds

Both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.voice` now use multi-stage builds:

**Stage 1: requirements-builder**
- Installs `uv` package manager
- Copies `pyproject.toml`
- Generates `requirements.txt` with voice extras
- Happens automatically during every Docker build

**Stage 2: application**
- Copies auto-generated `requirements.txt` from builder stage
- Installs all dependencies
- Builds the application

### 2. ✅ Dependency Files

Three dependency files work together:

| File | Purpose | Auto-Generated |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `pyproject.toml` | Source of truth | ❌ Manual |
| `uv.lock` | Locked versions | ✅ `make lock` |
| `requirements.txt` | Docker builds | ✅ During build OR `make requirements` |

### 3. ✅ Voice Support Added

Added optional dependency group in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies.voice]
voice = [
    "livekit>=0.1.0",
    "livekit-agents>=0.6.0",
    "livekit-plugins-assemblyai>=0.1.0",
    "livekit-plugins-cartesia>=0.1.0",
]
```

### 4. ✅ Updated Makefile

New Makefile with convenient commands:

```bash
# Dependency Management
make install          # Install with voice extras
make install-dev      # Install with dev tools
make lock             # Update uv.lock
make requirements     # Generate requirements.txt

# Docker
make docker-build     # Build all containers
make docker-up        # Start services
make docker-down      # Stop services
make docker-logs      # Show logs

# Development
make run-backend      # Run backend locally
make test             # Run tests
make lint             # Lint code
make format           # Format code

# Utilities
make clean            # Clean artifacts
make full-setup       # Complete setup
make test-simulation  # Run agent simulation
make info             # Show project info
```

### 5. ✅ Updated uv.lock

Ran `uv lock` to update lock file with all dependencies including new voice packages.

### 6. ✅ Created .dockerignore

Optimized Docker builds by excluding:
- Python cache files
- Virtual environments
- Git directories
- Data/database files
- Development files

## How It Works

### Docker Build Process

```
docker-compose build backend
  └─> Dockerfile
      ├─> Stage 1: requirements-builder
      │   ├─> Install uv
      │   ├─> Copy pyproject.toml
      │   └─> uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra voice -o requirements.txt
      └─> Stage 2: application
          ├─> Copy requirements.txt from stage 1
          ├─> pip install -r requirements.txt
          └─> Copy application code
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Always Up-to-Date**: requirements.txt is generated fresh on every build
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Only edit `pyproject.toml`
3. **No Drift**: Impossible for requirements.txt to be out of sync
4. **Fast Builds**: Docker caches layers efficiently
5. **Voice Support**: Automatic inclusion of LiveKit dependencies

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Build and start everything
make docker-build
make docker-up

# View logs
make docker-logs

# Stop services
make docker-down
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Edit dependencies
vim pyproject.toml

# 2. Update lock file (optional, Docker will auto-generate)
make lock

# 3. Rebuild containers
make docker-build

# 4. Restart services
make docker-restart
```

### Testing Locally (Without Docker)

```bash
# Install dependencies
make install

# Run backend
make run-backend

# Run tests
make test
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `.dockerignore` - Docker build optimization
- `DOCKER_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file
- `REQUIREMENTS_GENERATION.md` - Detailed dependency docs

### Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with auto-generation
- `Dockerfile.voice` - Multi-stage build with auto-generation
- `pyproject.toml` - Added voice optional dependencies
- `Makefile` - Updated with new commands
- `requirements.txt` - Regenerated with voice extras
- `uv.lock` - Updated with all dependencies

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (integro-agents-wip)
- ❌ Manual requirements.txt maintenance
- ❌ Version drift between requirements.txt and pyproject.toml
- ❌ No automatic generation
- ❌ 107-line loose requirements file

### After (integro-content)
- ✅ Automatic requirements.txt generation
- ✅ Always in sync with pyproject.toml
- ✅ Multi-stage Docker builds
- ✅ 641-line fully pinned requirements
- ✅ Voice support as optional extra
- ✅ Make commands for easy management

## Next Steps

### Run the Agent Lab

```bash
# Build everything
make docker-build

# Start services
make docker-up

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# Access services:
# - Backend API: http://localhost:8888
# - Frontend: http://localhost:8889
# - Qdrant: http://localhost:6333
# - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
```

### Test the Simulation System

```bash
# Run two-agent simulation
make test-simulation

# Or directly
python test_two_agent_simulation.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "uv not found"

The Dockerfile installs uv automatically. If this fails:
```bash
# Check your internet connection
# Try building without cache
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
```

### Package Not Found in Docker

```bash
# 1. Check it's in pyproject.toml
grep package_name pyproject.toml

# 2. Regenerate requirements.txt locally
make requirements

# 3. Rebuild without cache
docker-compose build --no-cache backend
```

### Docker Image Too Large

The image includes ML libraries (torch, CUDA) which are large. To optimize:
```bash
# Use CPU-only torch (edit pyproject.toml)
# Or use multi-stage builds to copy only necessary files
```

## Documentation

- **Dependency Management**: `REQUIREMENTS_GENERATION.md`
- **Simulation System**: `SIMULATION_README.md`
- **Agno Framework**: `agno_mapping.md`
- **Project Overview**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## Success Criteria

✅ Docker builds without errors
✅ requirements.txt auto-generated during build
✅ Voice agent dependencies included
✅ Multi-stage builds working
✅ Makefile commands functional
✅ uv.lock up to date
✅ .dockerignore optimized
